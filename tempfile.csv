"In recent years, the debate between home schooling versus attending a traditional school has become increasingly prevalent. Both methods of education have their own unique advantages, and choosing which one is right for your specific situation can be a difficult decision. So, what exactly are the benefits of home schooling when compared to traditional schooling?

One of the most obvious benefits of home schooling is customization. Parents who choose this option are able to tailor their children's curriculum to fit their individual needs and abilities. Home schooling allows parents to build a lesson plan that caters to not only their child's strengths, but also focuses on areas that their child needs help with. Additionally, home schooling allows parents to accommodate their children's unique interests and provide advanced instruction in topics of their interest. 

Another major benefit of home schooling is the freedom for learners to work at their own pace. While in traditional school classrooms, teachers are limited to an average set pace that does not cater to students with different learning styles. However, home schooling allows students to slow down and take their time in understanding a concept or to skip ahead if they already possess any prior knowledge. 

Finally, home schooling provides learners with a more flexible schedule and the option to structure learning around other activities. Home schooling gives students the freedom to decide when and where they want to work, making it easier for them to choose hands-on and out-of-the-classroom activities. 

Although both traditional school and home schooling have their advantages, those who opt for home schooling are able to take advantage of more individualized and flexible instruction. Home schooling allows learners the freedom to customize their own unique learning experience and create a more personalized educational setting.",1,1
"A Word Of Advice

Why do people ask for advice? To feel reassured? Or maybe they just want help in their situation. No one will ever be sure of the answer why, but there are always specific people that you should get advice from. There will always be people in your life to give you advice. Parents, adults, teachers, and your legal guardian are always good examples. Dependency is a great thing and is used in day to day life. Its a great support system for tasks the might seemÂ puzzling. Say you often second guess said persona's advice. You should always seek multiple opinions because sometimes you can get advice from the wrong source.

Everyone has had different experiences and everyone has their own opinion. For example you ask someone what the best food is at a restaurant you have never been to before. Well you dont want to be disappointed if you pick something you dont like so you should ask a friend for their opinion on the matter, but you should only get advice from the people you trust. What are one of best ways to get advice? Hosting a survey is a good example but not necessarily for personal topics. Surveys are a perfect way to collect data and get a wide opinion.

The internet is also another good place to get good advice. It has millions of topics ranging from medical advice to shopping advice. For example if you were sick and you didnt know what sickness you have the internet is a good way you can self diagnose. It can list treatment options and the time you might have to take for you to get better. Regardless on what it may be the internet is perfect for advice. Wikipedia is a website that has information on everything and is basically one big glossary for all topics. You can talk to millions of people over the internet and if you trust them enough asking them for advice can give you multiple answers, but they can surely help you find advice.

Multiple opinions can form a better choice. If you give power to other people to formulate an opinion it helps get a situation have a greater outcome. In America we use democracy to form our nation. Democracy is very useful and its what we use for our political tendencies. Voting is how we decide everything and it is a majority rule system. America's president every four years is decided by voting and is a very fair system. but its all opinion based and thats what makes it so great. America is fueled by the voice of its own people. But even that in its own way is advice.

At the end of the day advice comes in many different forms. It can be verbal, political and just plane out personal. Multiple voices formulate a greater outcome. Advice can be found anywhere and everywhere. Even though advice from others is great there is no better advice but your own, but you should always get your advice from good sources. But that is just a word of advice.",0,0
"Most people ask more than one person for advice there are many reasons for this but I'm going to say three reasons why I think people asking more than one person for advice is good.

One reason I think must people do this is to see which idea was the most responses. Another reason is you could test every idea that you get.

One last reason is some of the people could agree with the other person.

People try to ask a good amount of people just in case they hear more than one response from someone.

This is good to hear a lot of ideas and to see how many you get from the people you ask.

Don't ever be afraid to ask for advice from more than one person.

Maybe you have had to do this maybe you have had someone else ask you for advice.

Well i sure did I've had lots of times where I have asked someone in my family for advice.

Sometimes you are able to test some of the ideas you get.

This depends on what type of advice you are trying to take from someone.

Maybe you might be building something small like a shed and you have never built something before but you are determined to build it.

So you go and ask a friend that you know to tell you a few things on doing this job but before you go and build you go and practice on something so you know what to do.

I can relate to this you may even be able to relate.

I'm trying to build a tree house and I have had to ask for advice on building the treehouse.

The last reason is that one of the people you asked for advice may say or think the same thing as someone else that you asked for advice for.

Some don't think all the same things if you were to ask a bunch of people for advice they will not all give you the same answers but they will sometimes have the same meanings to them.

I think everyones ideas and try to show respect and listen but I don't take too much advice just in case that advice doesn't sound quite right like I said before don't be afraid to ask someone for advice.

Some people will disagree with my three reasons but I don't like to listen to the people who disagree with my reasons.

Maybe this helped you maybe it didn't.

To see which ideas was the most responsive ideas, you could test every idea you asked for and some might agree with one of the other ones you took advice from those are my three reasons on why most people take advice from more than one person.",0,0

Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should let students bring their phones to school because you never know when they be an emergency. What if someone comes in tries to rob the school and you cant call for help. The students can call or text for help. I do think students should be only allowed to use their phones in their own time or in lunch but not in class. If you let students bring phones to school you have an advantage because they can call a student that didn't come to school that day and ask why didn't they come.

I really do think that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, because you never know when you might need them . I do think they should have the phones of in class because they can get distracted and not put attention to the teacher. You can also use the help of the student incase you lost somebody or cant find them. I also think it will give them something to distract them. So they wont just think of school and the tests. Cell phones should be allowed for many reasons such as if they go on a field trip and their parents don't know what time to pick them up from school. They can just call their parents when there heading to school already. What if the have to stay after school? What if there parents don't pick up? They cant just stand their in front of the office until they pick up. So if you have your phone you can just text them or call them at what ever time you want with a teachers consent if your in class.

What if they had an accident and they need another pair of clothes but they don't answer from the school phone? You can just call your parents and tell them to bring you a new pair of cothes .

What if you get injured in game or playing outside? If students could take their phones to school it would be much better.

Well TEACHER_NAME

i have giving you several reasons why should you let us students bring phones to school. Know its your decision to",0,0
"Receiving multiple opinions from different people can help out a lot. Sometimes when people ask for advice, they don't always want to follow that specific person's advice. This is why receiving multiple opinions is better for some people. Seeking multiple opinions can help because it can allow you to understand through different point of views, It can help to get ideas on what you should do, and it allows people to understand where you're coming from. This is why people seek multiple opinions.

Seeking multiple opinions can allow you to see, listen to, and understand different people's point of views and how their advice can be beneficial in different ways. They might have a different perspective on what you think you should do, or what someone else thinks you should do, because we all think differently. Understanding where people are coming from, even if you disagree can also help you come up with one executive decision. For example, there could be an occasion where you want these nice shoes , but you don't have enough money so you go and ask for people's advice on what you should do. One person says, ask a family member for the money. You ask another person, they say steal the shoes from the store. In this scenario it allows you to think and understand what both people are trying to say and the benefits of each and then you can come down to which is a better choice. Stealing shoes from the store could get you in a lot of trouble, So the clear choice is to ask a family member.

Seeking multiple opinions can also allow people to see where you are coming from so they can try their best to give you the best advice possible. If they try to take a step in your shoes, and feel how your feeling about the situation then they can process and understand exactly whats happening and what they have to say about it. For example, if you are really sad about something and you talk to your friends about it, it allows them to feel empathy, and try to understand why you are sad, and what they can do to help you. Them seeing things through your point of view allowed them to feel what you are feeling which is why its easy and beneficial to get advice from multiple people. Especially people you trust.

Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you can get ideas and see what choice you can make based off of those opinions. Like if you were to need opinions on what color to paint your room, people would most likely give you different colors. Sometimes multiple people give you the same opinion when that occurs in a case like this, you'd usually go with whatever people think the most. For example, if six people said you should paint your room blue, and everybody else said different colors, you'd most likely paint it blue based of what peoples opinions were. Receiving opinions in this case is very beneficial to see what people think, and gather ideas

In conclusion, There are many ways seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinons help because, you can see things in different people's point of view, you can collect and gather peoples opinions and turn them into ideas, and it gives people a chance to show empathy, and be in your shoes.",0,0
"Dear principal

Have you ever had a goal that was bigger than life well me and my friends have some to we want to play sports but these demands on B or better in all subjects is making that hard .we think that you shouldn't change the policy on B or better to B ,that would really make the players work over time and most would not have the time to play and to turn in B plus work.

by doing so the players would have a bad time and they wouldn't have the fun that these sports bring them.

With this new policy comes a lot of problems like some of the star players are C students and i don't think that they could Get a B in every class. most of the students not playing sports are below the C average and they have extra time to do it in twenty thirty maybe even hours more than most sports players in the school .Also the people who do have all B' s aren't playing sports because to caught up in work to get those b' s.

Most students will have to leave sports all together because they cant make the grades ,Maybe making the teams lose the best players in the school. Most of these kids are natural players taking this away will make them turn to other alternatives such as playin",0,0
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed with the goal of ensuring smaller states have more influence in presidential elections, I believe its current implementation no longer serves that purpose and can undermine the principle of one person, one vote.

The texts provide compelling arguments both for and against retaining the Electoral College. Supporters argue it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on a few high population states. However, opponents counter that the system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has occurred a few times in history, most recently in 2000 and 2016, undermining the perception that the winner truly has the most nationwide support. It also means that voters in non-competitive states feel their votes have less influence. 

Moving to a popular vote system could increase voter turnout and interest by making every vote equally important regardless of what state someone lives in. It would align better with the principle of majority rule and one person, one vote. While some argue this might incentivize candidates focusing only on population centers, the unprecedented amount of travel and campaigning required to win a majority of votes across the entire country would still encourage reaching a wide range of Americans. Concerns about big state dominance could also be addressed by awarding electoral votes proportionally instead of winner-take-all in each state.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College may have served an important purpose in the past, today it can undermine faith in elections and discourage voter participation. A popular vote system would better uphold democratic principles of one person, one vote and electing the candidate with the most overall support. I urge you to support reforming our system of presidential elections. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

"Phones and Driving

In today's current society almost everyone in the world has access or owns a cellular device. That device that can call text or email right from your pocket. While it is so very useful it can also become quite distracting to someone who might be driving. Which leads to the point that Drivers should not be able to access their phones while driving. In these cases its smart to look at the annual driver and cell phone related instances that have happened over the years as well as the averages of crashes involving phones and the driver.

Cell Phone users while they are driving are 5.36 times more likely to get into an accident when driving accordion to a study done at the University of Utah (""Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks."" University of Utah News, archive. unews. utah. edu/news_releases/drivers-on-cell-phones-are-as-bad-as-drunks/). These statistics show how more likely a driver is to get in an accident while on their cell phones. That isn't a small number 5.36 is a larger number of people when taking into account how many use their phones while driving anyways. This leads into how many people actually die to chances like these.

In 2015 alone there were 3,477 people killed in a distracted driver accident. 476 of which in those cases were cell phone users.(""Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving."" EndDD, www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoaz3BRDnARIsAF1RfLevzm7d8WG_o9fmbSLCDrfzuhq4pSz6LYGnFCL65o0N-OBsj-T8u8YaAh1_EALw_wcB.). These numbers when taking into account how those deaths could have been prevented by simply putting the phone down while driving are extremely high. That is 13 percent of all drivers that died last year were on their phones. And those people would still be alive had they put the phone down.

These statistics do not lie when saying how people die due to cellular phones being used while driving. With that when 13 percent of the annual driving related deaths are all cellphone based and with the ever growing world that number will go up. That is unless the Driver puts the phone downs while he drives.            ",0,0
"No they should not use the technology in class rooms because thats a invashion of pricicy. And they dont need to know every little thing going on in our lives. Becouse every one need there privicy and if schools use that technology there taking that away completly. And why would you use that in a class room any way to spy on people thats a little creepy you know and also why would the teacher even what that becouse thats looking at them too. So there for in my choice the technology is not valuale and should not be put into classrooms or anywhere for that matter becouse every needs that privcy and no one will be able to get that if that technology is around. Another reason we should have it is becouse why would you want people to know your exact emotions anyways if they can read your emotions they can pretty much tell what your thinking by that.

So that is the reaons I think we should not have the facial action coding systems.",0,0
"What if something goes wrong? The driverless cars are a good idea, but I don't think they are going to be safe. The article gives its negatives and positive things about the driverless cars, but in my opinion I don't think is a good idea to manufacture these cars. The driverless cars are not a good idea because what if something goes wrong with the technology of the car, they even have to change things in the law and add, driverless cars don't sound safe as it seems.

The driverless cars are not a good idea becuase what if something goes wrong with the technology of the car, like the passage says, if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is it fault the driver or the manufacture. If the driver gets in the accident and they don't know if the technology failed or if it was the drivers fault, it would be a mess becuase if the driver doesn't want to pay becuase its too expensive and the factory that made doesn't wanto to pay either they will have to go to court. Technology is not always perfect so I don't think they should use technology in a car just because some people don't want to drive.

They have to change a few thing in the law, according to the article most driving laws focus on keeping the passengers, drivers, and pedestrians safe. One of the laws is that the driver has control at all times, with the driverless car you are not the only one in control the car is too, so like I said early what if the technology of the car fails. Even if traffic law changes, new laws have to be establish in order to cover liability in case of an accident. To make the changes in the law it would be another mess and a lot of arguments to say to make it happen. These are different cars so they would have to change and add more laws.

The driverless cars don't sound so safe because the driver is not the only one in control, the car is too. The article says that the driver has its eyes on the road and the car on the driver, but if the technology fails and the car makes a mistake and becuase of the car mistake the driver would be paying the consequences of that mistake. Everybody makes mistakes so if the factory that was making the cars makes a lot of mistakes on the cars and nobody catches the problems, its going to make a lot of people pay that mistake.

The driverless cars are not a good idea becuase they don't sound safe as it seems, it has a lot of negatives things that can cause a lot of problems, and they have to change and add things to the law.          ",0,0
