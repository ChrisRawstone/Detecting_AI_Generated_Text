"The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural occurrence. On Mars, there are things called a battle or mesa. Which in fact, is what this ""face"" really is. I know this because in the article, that was based off NASA's own research, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a battle or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" We have these landforms on our very own planet, so its understandable as to how we can recognize one on another planet.

On top of that, we used top quality equipment to study and research the Face on Mars. This is backed up by how in the article it says, ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,' said Gavin. 'Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo.""

In the article itself it even says that the face is no alien monument. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" With all that being said, with all the proof NASA gathered, it's impossible for the ""Face on Mars"" to be anything but a natural occurrence.",0,0
"Students have a higher chance of catching a virus during school hours. Viruses could easily spread to others by touching or any other types of physical interactions. It's not easy to cure a virus and some viruses could be deadly, like the Coronavirus. A lot of people, mostly students in Wuhan, China are getting this virus and most of them claim it spread through physical interaction. The virus is spreading quickly, and now we have many cases and few deaths in the U.S. Even though it is very important to be interacting with other students when you are in school, a single touch could possibly harm you. Some people believe that distance learning is not beneficial since students need to interact with others; However, being able to attend classes from home is a huge advantage and a good way for students to avoid catching any type of virus.

Many schools offer distance learning only for students who need it. Some schools offer it as an option for students who want to attend classes from home. Students can easily attend school classes either online or by video conferencing. One of the advantages of distance learning is that, students are not going to wait on their buses early in the morning when its cold, foggy, and rainy. Instead, they will be sitting at home feeling cozy and safe while doing their school work. However, in winter, when students enter the school building it's usually very warm and when they leave it's freezing outside, so they end up catching a cold. That leads to parents having to spend money and take their children to the hospital. In the hospital there are many sick people around, so students could catch viruses easily. Distance learning could also help parents save up money and not having to worry about taking their kids to the hospital because students are less likely to get sick and catch a cold when they are at home.

Since the Coronavirus is made out of many viruses and germs joined together, being outside when its cold or being around many students could be dangerous. One way for students to prevent themselves from catching this virus is by washing their hands all the time. Because this virus could also spread through droplets when coughing or sneezing. Students always forget to wash their hands after they cough and when they touch other students they spread germs. Parents, however, are always reminding their children to wash their hands before doing anything. When students attend classes from home they are spending more time with their parents. Therefore, students will always be reminded to wash their hands. That way they will be safe and prevented from catching or spreading any germs.

In conclusion, distance learning or attending classes from home is a beneficial advantage for students to look forward into. It's not only a good way to protect students from catching or spreading deadly viruses, It will also help parents spend less money when it comes to hospital bills and school supplies such as backpacks and books. Also, Students are going to be around their family and pets which means they are going to feel more happy doing their school work. They are not going to sit around watching the clock waiting to go home because they are going to be already home. By staying home and attending classes at home, students aren't going to be catching diseases and then spreading to other people. Clearly, they aren't going to be harmed or harm people. Distance learning is the best start that that will take us to the solution to those deadly problems.",0,1
"Driverless cars have good and bad things that would go along with them. From my perspective though I believe that we could go without them. Cars that can drive themselves not only puts the one driving in danger but anyone around the car. Having driverless cars just makes us lazy, if we can not drive a car. Driverless cars should not be something we should invest our money into.

Cars that can drive themselves is a very dangerous and scary idea. A big machine that is operating itself around others that are doing the exact thing is not a good idea. Very many mechanical mishaps could happen easily to cause the car to do things it wasn't made to do. If an animal or a person would happen to jump in the street would the car be able to detect that and stop the car before something very bad was to happen?

Having driverless cars puts a bad message on us. Having driverless cars would mean we don't want to drive or are too tried to drive or just to lazy. I think that this would make the United States look bad if we were to happen to get driverless cars.

Driverless cars may save us money individual but over all as a country I think we could lose money. Driverless cars have so many sensors and devices that would need to be installed and would have to be manufactured which causes a lot of money. ""These smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This was stated to show that these sensors and things that are needed to manufacture these cars are more expensive than they should be. This is why I think driverless cars are a bad idea.",0,2
"Some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way. Others might say that it is not.

I agree with this statement. If you are traveling by yourself, you might want to consider traveling with a guide who is experienced in the area you plan to visit. A good guide can help you make the most of your trip.

"How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.

In the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an huge interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyway, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.

With the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many opportunities that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremely helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievement for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside the school as well.

In the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activities that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.

In conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activities may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",0,4
"In the past few years, cellphones have become a major use of communication for many people. Cellphone has become a major issue in the field of driving. Many people drive while they're on the cellphone. The use of cellphones while driving should be banned. I say this because there have been 60-70% of drivers that have died, crashed due to the fact that they are using their cellphones while driving.

To begin with, the use of cellphones while driving should be stopped. In the last few years there have been many car crashes because people are all into their phones when they overall focus should be driving. At times cellphones can be of good use. But not all the time. People use cellphones to help them get to and from, but they shouldn't be used all the time.

According to the law of Tennessee, ""banning hand-held cellphone use while driving takes effect July 1"". ""Beginning July 1, the drivers could face a major fine up to $200 for using their cellphones while driving"". This should be banned in the state of Georgia, because the drivers don't realize how much damage they're causing when they are on their cellphones.

In conclusion, cellphones should be banned. They should not be used while driving. If people want to avoid getting into accidents they should stop using their phones while driving. If there weren't any accidents the world would be a safer place. Having cellphones can be of good use as well. But only if people use them that way. Making a phone call while driving can be dangerous as well. Making phone calls aren't always that important. So banning cellphones while driving could result in a better solution.  ",0,5
"Cell phones have become an essential tool for communication in our daily lives. However, when it comes to using them while driving, it's a topic of much debate. Some people argue that drivers should be able to use their cell phones in certain circumstances, while others believe that it's too risky and could lead to accidents. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. When we are behind the wheel, our focus should be on the road and the other cars around us. If we are busy texting, calling, or browsing social media, we are taking our eyes off the road and our hands off the wheel. This increases the chances of getting into an accident, which could not only harm us but also other innocent people. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. This is a staggering number and proves that distracted driving is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs our reaction time. When we are driving, we need to be able to react quickly to unexpected situations. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly steps into the road, we need to be able to hit the brakes immediately. However, if we are busy with our cell phone, we might not be able to react as quickly, which could result in a tragic accident. Our reaction time is critical when it comes to driving, and using a cell phone compromises that.

Thirdly, there are many other ways to communicate while driving that are safer than using a cell phone. For example, we can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, to take calls and communicate with others. We can also use voice-to-text features to send messages or make calls without having to physically handle our phones. These alternatives allow us to communicate safely while still keeping our eyes on the road and our hands on the wheel.

Lastly, setting a good example is important. As drivers, we have a responsibility to set a good example for other drivers and pedestrians. If we use our cell phones while driving, we are sending a message that it's okay to do so, which could encourage other drivers to do the same. This could lead to a culture of distracted driving, which would be detrimental to road safety.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is a risky behavior that can lead to accidents and fatalities. It's important that we prioritize road safety and avoid distractions while driving. There are safer alternatives available, such as hands-free devices and voice-to-text features, which allow us to communicate without compromising our safety. As drivers, we have a responsibility to set a good example and promote safe driving practices. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",1,6
"Hey there!  So, you know, making decisions in life can be super tough. Like, there are so many things to consider, and it's hard to know what's best. But, I think it's really important to listen to both your heart and mind when making choices.

Like, your heart can tell you what you really want and what makes you happy, but your mind can help you figure out how to make it happen. It's like, they're both trying to tell you what to do, but in different ways. And, you know, it's important to listen to both of them because they're both important.

But, sometimes, people can be really negative and try to bring you down. They might be like, ""Oh, you're never going to make it."" Or, ""That's not going to work."" And, it's easy to get caught up in that and start feeling like you can't do things. But, you have to ignore that stuff. Like, you have to have faith in yourself and your ideas, even if other people don't.

So, how do you stay motivated and ignore the negativity? Well, I think it's important to set goals for yourself and work towards them. Like, if you want to start a business, you have to start taking steps towards making it happen. And, you have to be willing to learn and take risks. It's not going to be easy, but it'll be worth it in the end.

And, it's also important to surround yourself with people who support you and believe in you. Like, if you're trying to start a band, you want people who are going to be like, ""Yeah, you can do it!"" And, not try to bring you down.

So, in conclusion, listening to your heart and mind when making decisions and staying motivated to achieve success can be really hard, but it's important to do it. You have to ignore the negativity and keep going. And, it's okay to ask for help and support along the way. Thanks for reading!",1,7
"In my op pinon school is good how it is now. Having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break. For example if I were to leave school for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a difference. And I'm a sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. A year-around school benefits teachers not students. Because they if they did have a year-around teachers wouldn't have to worry about reteaching it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. So they should have a regular schedule for the schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. When their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that, but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the students as much. If they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students, and they only have a certain amount of time to get things done within the time period, and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldn't get everything done in time then the whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go through tall that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students don't stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain about of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks in between school days just so that they have months off on their summer break.",0,8
"Researching the pros and cons of accelerated high school experiences has become increasingly relevant for today’s teens. Students who have accelerated their high school experience and succeeded, and those who have failed, have provided valuable case studies and insights into the challenges armed, and unprepared students can face. 

Successful students have often cited the acceleration of their high school experience as providing them with an opportunity to get ahead in college before their peers. For instance, students who graduate early may be able to begin college with a major or focus on a field of study before other students who are just entering college. On the other hand however, unprepared and ill-advised students who have accelerated their high school experience have found themselves facing difficulties, such as ill-preparedness for college level classes, struggling to make friends, and missing out on high school experiences and events.

It is important to consider these implications for the future of education, and ensure that adolescents are properly informed and advised when considering accelerating their high school experience. With the right knowledge, support, and preparation, these students can tap into the opportunities that accelerated high school can provide, while avoiding the pitfalls of inexperience and insufficient preparation.",1,9
"Why should anyone want to have a car drive you anywhere you want to go when you can drive yourself? You should be the one in control of the car not the other way around, there could be a malfunction with the car that might cause a break, and they don't need more technology to a car, because at the end of the day you're not going to have it all of your life. I'm against having the Google car, because who needs a literally has laser beams that comes out of the top of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

You should be the one in control of the car at all times. A person learns how to drive for a reason. They learn how to drive, so that their parents don't have to anymore, to maybe go places by yourself, and just to see how well you have learned to drive and how much you have improved before you started to drive in the first place. Having a human drive you are better than a robot driving you because you have an advantage of learning and continuing how to learn how.

Having malfunctions is a big problem. There is a lot that can happen to you if you manage to mess something up or if you just crash and wreak your car. You can push a button that can do some serious harm to you or anyone that is in the car at the time, you can break some bones by cracking into another car or a tree, and it can make you have some type of brain damage. Having malfunctions are bad, but dying in the process of your vehicle having a malfunction is horrible.

You're not always going to have that car all of you life. You might sell it, pass it down to one of your kids, or just leave it on the side of the road. I don't know what you would do with it. Not everybody has had a car the have had all of their life that would be a big problem in having it all your life. Having a Google car isn't always going to be there.

I will not agree for having a Google car, but if I did, i couldn't possibly let it drive for me. I would be the one to drive it at all times.",0,10
"Driverless cars may seem like a cool new innovation that take the stress away from driving. The truth is that while there are many positive things about driverless cars there are still many complications with introducing them into society. Without a driver, the mechanics could malfunction and cause a safety threat to other drivers and pedestrians. Many states also have laws against even testing driverless cars. Even thought the car can do the basic driving by itself, the human passengers still need to take control for more complicated road conditions. The production and use of driverless cars is negative to society because they pose a safety threat, force laws to change, and they still require human control.

Safety is always a concern when dealing with any type of motor vehicle and driverless cars increase the risk of safety because they do not have human control. Every state has road laws that every driver is meant to follow. Traffic laws assume that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence states how the laws believe that a car is only safe when there is a human controlling it. These laws are meant to promote safety and since they state a human needs to be in control for a vehicle to be safe, then driverless cars are not the best thing for safety. This is negative because when there is a larger safety risk, more people may be fatally injured and the public will feel unsafe. The use of driverless cars on the road would require the laws to be modified and allow their use.

Another way that driverless cars are negative to society is that they would force the laws to change to accommodate them. All over the country there are laws in place that prohibit the use of driverless cars. According to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"". Since driverless cars are illegal in most states, in order for them to be used on the roads all the laws relevant to this topic would need to be changed or adjusted. Changing the laws is negative because changing the already safe laws could cause the public to be unsafe and the process for changing the laws is a castle. It needs to be sent in and approved by many government branches and could be rejected by anyone, causing the process to repeat. Not only is it a castle and burden, it is also taking a lot of time. Even if the laws are changed the cars still require human involvement

Driverless cars may seem more convenient but in reality they require human interaction in any tough traffic situation. As a result this is negative because it is not improving the convenience for drivers. Some say that driverless cars are more convenient, but in fact they can only perform the easy aspects of driving without the aid from the human driver. Driverless cars ""can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires human skills""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence shows how involved humans have to be in a ""driverless"" car. An invention that seems convenient actually requires the driver to be more alert, so they know when they need to step in to control the car in difficult situations. This is negative because waiting for difficult road conditions can cause a driver to be more stressed and anxious than they would be if they were normally driving a car. Since the driver needs to more alert and the fact that driverless cars are not that convenient at all there is no reason for them to be on the roads.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be produced and driven on the roads because they pose a safely threat to the public, they require the laws to change, and they still need human interaction and therefore are not a convenience. Considering this, is it really worth all the risk and castle just for something ""cool"" to be on the road? Would it still be cool if these vehicles endangered you or a family member?",0,11
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It is time for us to elect our president by popular vote.

There are many reasons why the Electoral College is a flawed system. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. In a state like Wyoming, for example, a single vote is worth three times as much as a vote in California. This is because each state has two senators, regardless of population, and each state has a number of electors equal to the number of its representatives in Congress plus its two senators. This means that a voter in Wyoming has 3.7 times as much power as a voter in California in choosing the president.

Second, the Electoral College can lead to results that do not reflect the will of the people. In 2000, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election to George W. Bush. This was because Bush won more electoral votes, even though Gore won more votes nationwide. This has happened four other times in our history, and it is a clear sign that the Electoral College is not a fair system.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of ""battleground"" states. These are states where the outcome of the election is uncertain, and they are the only states where candidates spend any time campaigning. This means that voters in other states are essentially ignored by the candidates, which is not fair to them.

Finally, the Electoral College is a relic of a bygone era. It was created in a time when the United States was a very different country. The Founding Fathers were worried that a popular vote for president would give too much power to the large states, so they created the Electoral College as a way to protect the interests of the small states. However, this is no longer a valid concern. The United States is now a much more populous country, and the small states are no longer at a disadvantage.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It is time for us to elect our president by popular vote. This would be a fair and just system that would give all voters a voice.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,12
"When electing the President of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolux College to decide. The Electoral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. Many people dislike this system including myself. I disprove of this system because it limits representation, permits the disinterest of voters, and reduces a candidates interest in a state.

One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. The Electoral College votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states receives. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only receives one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for Wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have accurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. There have also been times in which a president has won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote.

One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait.

As stated before, the larger the population of a state, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. In many states throughout an election period (the period in which candidates move to different states giving speeches) the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president.

The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. Moving to popular vote will fix all of these problems and will improve the way we vote for our president.",0,13
" Completing high school one year early can seem like a great opportunity for students to start their careers and gain experience. However, it is important to consider the benefits of completing the traditional four years of high school before moving on to college. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why it is better to finish high school in the traditional manner.

Firstly, completing the four years of high school allows students to prepare more for college. This time can be used to reflect on one's interests and career goals, and to take the necessary steps to achieve them. For example, the four years of high school helped me to discover my passion for a particular field and to work towards it. It also helped me to become more mature and prepared for the next step.

Secondly, it is too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17. At this age, students may not be fully ready to take on the responsibilities of college life. They may not have had enough time to mature and develop the skills necessary to succeed in college. For example, my younger brother is 16 and is currently a junior in high school. When we have nothing to do or are having a conversation, I always ask him if he is ready to go to college, and his response is that he is not even ready for his senior year. I understand his perspective, as I was his age when I was a junior.

Finally, students may not have had enough education to succeed in college. Completing four years of high school allows students to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in college. If students graduate early, they may be at a disadvantage in college, as they may not have had enough time to fully understand the material. For example, I have heard from some friends in college that they struggled in certain classes, even though they graduated from high school at 18. This suggests that if students graduate early, they may not have had enough time to fully understand the material.

In conclusion, completing high school in the traditional manner has many benefits. It allows students to prepare more for college, it is not too early for students to finish high school, and it allows students to gain the necessary education to succeed in college. High school is a crucial step in one's life, and completing it in the traditional manner can set the stage for success in the future.",1,14
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers. The author has a few reasons of why he thinks this. Some of them are to find out what it is made up of. Another one is to try and find out why there is no life on Mars. Also even though he thinks they should explore it he talks about the dangers and how really dangerous it is. There are a lot of risks to exploring Venus, but it would be worth it.

One thing that the author does well to support his idea is he gives a lot of compelling reasons of why he this Venus is worth exploring. One of the reasons why he thinks its worth exploring is because they can find out what Venus is made up of by taking rock samples. I think this is a good reason because it explains how the author wants to explore Venus despite its dangers. Another reason why he thinks it should be explored despite its dangers is because they can figure out why there is no life on Venus. I also think this is a good reason because it proves why Venus should be explored even though it is dangerous according to the author.

In conclusion the author has a good point of why Venus should be explored despite the dangers. One of his reasons is to find out why there is no life on Venus. Another reason is to find out what Venus is made up of. I think these are good supporting reasons because they prove why Venus should be explored even though it has dangers.",0,15

Dr. Huang explains this innovation as he says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor."" (Paragraph 6). This new change would make the lesson more beneficial to the student as it would make the student more interested in the lesson, further allowing them to retain information better later on.

The lesson may be beneficial to the student academically, but is it causing mental health issues as it supports more screen time? FACS is all computer based, meaning less time in the classroom and more time in front of the computer. The student would be conducting this program on a school computer as D'Alto explains, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" (Paragraph 7) the program ends up promoting more screen time, something that students should get less of, instead of human interaction, which our society needs more of. In a way FACS program is not beneficial or valuable to the student mentally as it promotes something that our society needs less of.

This technology could be also very beneficial to those who do not have the best teacher or education available to them. When FACS makes that facial emotion recognition it adjusts the lesson, allowing the students to understand the lesson better, as Dr. Huang explained. This would be beneficial to students who have a poor education environment as their teachers might not recognize these facial expressions, causing the student to not understand the lesson which later leads them to falling behind in class.

This new technology has many pros and cons, but also brings students a new way of understanding. FACS could possibly bring grades up along with educational improvement. This program may support more screen time, causing students mental health issues, along with eyesight to deteriorate, but if this program is used wisely, none of those things should happen. This new technology should bring a new way of understanding, making FACS a valuable resource to students.  ",0,16
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

You have to make a decision on whether to make all the students perform community service let me tell you my point of view. I strongly encourage you to have all the students perform community service for various reasons. The first reason is that some places desperately need help from young willing students. Also, this will help better prepare students for work in the future. Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach students responsibility. Now, ponder my reasoning and read about all of my various ideas about this subject.

First and foremost, community service is a great way for low income and rundown places to get help from young willing students. They are strong and able to help for long periods of time. Some places, like community shelters, desperately need help because they are financially instable, and they don't have enough money to hire help. This will give them more help, and they will get things done faster. Also, this will save them a lot of money because they wouldn't have to hire anyone new. The work would get done, but at a faster and more affordable rate, not to mention that they will be very grateful.

To add to my reasoning, this experience will better help a multitude of students gain insight into what It's like to work. People spend more time working than anything else and this experience will help them prepare for that. They will know what it is like to commit to a job. They will have to work to either get enough volunteer hours or get a good grade. Furthermore, they will have to help the best they can and give one hundred percent of their efforts in order to do well and gain the respect of who they are volunteering for. This is vital for a good relationship and for an overall good grade. This will help them prepare for what It's like to work in the real world. They even may find what job they really want to do by volunteering or volunteer where they want to work.

Finally, the most important reason is that this will teach the students' responsibility. Nowadays students are lazy and just watch television or play video games all the time. This will make them strive for something better with their life. It will teach them what it means to work hard and to be dedicated. In this generation, the work ethic is at a minimum, and we are just downright lazy. This might make kids want to get up and work if they find a job or volunteering center that really interests them. They will eventually want to get up and go do their community service without being asked or told. They may even make a bond with whom they are volunteering for, and they may make a friendship for life.

In summation, volunteering is very beneficial for various reasons. First, volunteering helps places that are in need of workers and a helping hand. Also, this experience will help better prepare students when they get jobs in the future. Finally, volunteering will give the students' responsibility. These are very excellent points that I know you will carefully consider and ponder, because that is the right thing to do. This is really what volunteering is about, not the material things you do, but how you change while doing them.

Your student,

"Dear Senator,

I am writing as a concerned citizen to discuss the ongoing debate regarding the retention of the Electoral College or shifting to a popular vote system for Presidential Elections. I am of the stronger belief that maintaining our current system of the Electoral College is beneficial for stable and balanced representation.

The Electoral College, as established in the Constitution, provides a balance between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. This mechanism focuses on the objective of enhancing the voice of each state, particularly smaller ones who otherwise may be undermined in a simple popular vote system.

While the detractors claim it can be confusing for voters and lends a higher risk of “faithless” electors, occurrences of such events are rare, as trust is rarely betrayed within the established elector slates of each party. Moreover, historically, discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote are extremely infrequent, with only five instances since the founding of our country.

There are several practical reasons for preserving the Electoral College. Firstly, it provides a certainty of outcome. The existence of a winner-take-all rule in nearly all states inherently reduces the likelihood of a dispute over popular vote. Secondly, it demands a nationwide appeal from a presidential candidate, acknowledging that no single region can elect a president, ensuring a balanced and fair representation.

Critics argue that this system leads candidates to focus only on swing states during campaigns, minimizing the focus on more certain states. However, while swing states may receive more focus during campaigns, it can be argued that energizing voters in these crucial states leads to higher information dissemination and therefore a more thoughtfully informed electorate.

Finally, the Electoral College helps overcome a shortfall in the representation of larger states due to the equal representation of votes in the Senate. For instance, a win in a populous state like Florida would give a nominee 29 electoral votes, while the same win margin in Wyoming would result in just 3 votes. 

While critics suggest that the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, I believe we should perceive it as a measure to preserve our federative system and safety guard the interests of smaller states, ensuring that the candidate who becomes president truly represents all sections of our country. Therefore, I kindly urge your support in advocating for the maintenance of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,18
"In the world, there are people who believe in aliens or supernatural beings, while some do not. The face on Mars is an example of an occurrence that causes people to believe in aliens or supernatural beings. Even though this is true, there are still many people who think the landform is a natural occurrence. There are ways to prove that this theory for the landform is true. Reasons such as the landform being compared to natural, earth landforms, and it has similar characteristics as earth landforms help prove this is true.

The landform was compared to a butte or a mess. This means it is quite similar to earthly landforms and may have occurred due to something that happened on Mars. The face on Mars is compared one main earth landform that was mentioned. The landform is Middle Butte, which is located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It was a lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa.

The face on Mars had the same look and height as an Earth landform, a mesa. It is true that there is an unusual shape to the face on Mars, there are similar occurrences that happen on Earth. Though this happens on Earth, people don't say that these Earth landforms were made by aliens.

This landform is just like other occurrences on separate planets that resemble Earth landforms. Even though the landform resembles a human face, it doesn't mean the landform is an alien's doing. Just like landforms on Earth, there are more ways than one to prove the reason or the starting place of a landform.  ",0,19
"Can an activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.

If more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just have a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their teammates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably is weird at the beginning, but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to doing, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.

Doing any activity outside school also work makes' people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind their goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discover and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do, they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outside the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physically, and it makes he or she has a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence its family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influences other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the or them have changed, so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.

Like always everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also, for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most common problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.  ",0,20

I understand that you expect a lot out of students at

SCHOOL_NAME and want them to do they best, and just because you our principal and care a lot about us, you will do whatever it takes for us to achieve. But doing work all the time can be tiring. I think if you have a C or higher on your report card, you should be able to do sports. As long as your student are passing they should be able to have fun and play sports. Not only is sports fun, it helps us with exercising and staying in shape. If students play sports and work out, they will work they brain and other body parts. Playing sports means a lot to us hear at your school because we can come together and work as a team.

Sport shows us new things like getting your anger out in a good way, feeling good about yourself, teamwork, etc. I really hope you will let people with a C average play sports because we try our BEST here, and as long as we are giving you 110%, you should let us play sports and enjoy our selves !

"Successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks. They know that in order to achieve great things, they need to push themselves outside their comfort zone. This willingness to experiment and take risks is what sets them apart from others and allows them to reach their full potential.

For example, consider the story of Bill Gates. He was a college dropout who started a software company in his garage. At the time, most people thought he was crazy for trying something so risky. But Gates was not afraid to take a chance. He knew that if he didn't try something new, he would never achieve his goals. And his gamble paid off. Gates is now one of the richest and most successful people in the world.

Another example is Elon Musk. He is the founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and several other successful companies. He is a risk-taker who is always trying new things. For example, when other people were afraid to send people into space, Musk founded SpaceX to make space travel accessible to everyone. His willingness to take risks has led to many groundbreaking innovations.

Successful people know that in order to achieve great things, they need to push themselves outside their comfort zone. They are not afraid to try new things and take risks. This willingness to experiment and take risks is what sets them apart from others and allows them to reach their full potential.

"There is no doubt that our society has become increasingly wasteful in recent years. We are producing more and more garbage, and much of it is plastic bags and other types of packaging. This is a major problem, because plastic bags and other types of packaging are not biodegradable, meaning that they do not break down and decompose naturally. As a result, they accumulate in our environment, posing a serious threat to both our ecology and our health.

There are several reasons why this has happened. One is that we have become increasingly reliant on plastic bags and other types of packaging. They are cheap and convenient, and so we use them without thinking about the consequences. Another reason is that our waste disposal systems are not adequate. We have not developed the infrastructure necessary to recycle or properly dispose of all this waste, and so it ends up in our environment.

Ultimately, we need to take responsibility for our own actions. We need to start using less plastic bags and other types of packaging, and we need to demand that our governments do more to develop the necessary waste disposal systems. Only then will we be able to protect our environment and our health.

"I think limiting car usage is a great idea for America. Studies show that in Bogotá, ""the people are generating a revolutionary change."" Says Enrique Rear, the major of Asunción, Paraguay. People are either walking to their destinations or riding their bicycles. Also, the less you use your car, means less air pollution everywhere, so the Earth is healthier.

Limiting car usage could also help people's physical and mental health. Walking could lower your stress levels and let you think about the nature that you see instead of thinking about what your mad at. I know this from experience because I get stressed very easily and walking anywhere helps me calm down. Another thing about limiting car usage is that the car wreck percentage would be lower than it is right now. There would also be fewer deaths in the world if they limited the usage of cars.

Did you know that there are prominently 118 miles of bicycle paths only in Bogotá? Well there is and according to Mocks, the city's major, ""It's the most of any Latin American city."" Also, you could use the bicycle paths as walking paths for exercise or just to walk anywhere. People would be in more shape if they limited cars. But the only bad thing about using a car in Vauban, Germany is that you have to pay for the car and a spot to keep it while only being able to drive it on the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

In conclusion I think it would be a great idea for America to go car-free.",0,24
" Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my strong support for the continued use of the Electoral College as the current method for choosing the President of the United States. Furthermore, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our political system and provides several benefits that are difficult to replicate through a popular vote. Furthermore, I appreciate your consideration of my perspective on this important issue.

First and foremost, I believe that the Electoral College provides a sense of national representation in the election process. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its population, which means that larger states have a greater influence on the outcome of the election than smaller states. This means that candidates must pay attention to all regions of the country and not just focus on densely populated areas, as they would in a popular vote system. This ensures that the best candidate for the job is elected, regardless of where they come from.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a degree of certainty in the election process. While electoral votes can still be contested, it is much less likely than a popular vote contested by a losing candidate. This means that the country can move forward quickly after an election, without the long and drawn-out process of a recount or court challenge.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it forces candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters. In a popular vote system, candidates may focus on smaller, more liberal or conservative regions, depending on which group they believe will vote for them. However, in the Electoral College, candidates must appeal to voters across the country, which ensures that they are addressing the needs of all Americans.

Finally, the Electoral College helps to prevent the tyranny of the majority. While a popular vote system may seem like the most direct way to choose a president, it can also lead to the unintended consequences of suppressing the voices of minority groups. By giving each state a certain number of votes, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the will of the people as a whole, rather than just the will of the majority.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our political system. It ensures that all voices are heard, that the best candidate for the job is elected, and that the country can move forward quickly after an election. I urge you to continue supporting the use of the Electoral College in future elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"We should keep the Electoral College it's a good process, and it keeps us from having the problem of elections in which no candidates receive a majority of the votes cast. Like in 1968 with Nixon and in 1992 in Clinton were they only got 43 percent plurality of the popular votes but with the Electoral College which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no chance of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, an idea of this is like a Republican in California. The Electoral College needs a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal like South, Northeast,etc. With the Electoral College is UN likelier than a dispute over the popular vote. It happened in 2000 because that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. An example is in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non Democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overpowered by declaring the candidate who get the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are right in debating that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When u vote you're not voting for the presidential u pick for're actually voting for a slate of electors. Both party each selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, but that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral college is good to stay.

The Electoral College helps with Certainty of outcome, Everyone's president, Swing states, Big States, Avoid run off elections. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total of numbers of votes are 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. The new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. So other being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign that a small state does. Voters in a presidential election are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  ",0,26
"What do most people think can do things better, people or machines? I, like most people, believe things are done better by hand. Would someone want a lifesaving operation done by a living doctor that knows what is going on and where things are, or a robot that is programmed to do it and could malfunction. I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times.

Cars do not actually see the things that surround them. If the driver decides not to pay attention and one of the cars sensors were to malfunction then the lives of many people hang in balance. Road constructions and traffic jams could pose a threat as well. When these things happen do the cars just shut down or try and get through themselves. Either way major safety hazards will arise. Just like in paragraph 2, right now ""driverless"" cars cannot even get out of a driveway alone. Unless some major adjustments were to come soon, driverless cars remain a huge threat to safety.

What if someone were to get hurt in a driverless car accident? The car malfunctions and the driver could not take control and gets hurt. Who willingly takes responsibility, the driver or the company? Like stated in paragraph 9, to figure this out the country would have to make more laws. All that will waste a large amount of time for both the companies that make driverless cars and congress who makes the laws. Driverless cars will give people trouble before they even hit the road.

I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times. No matter what driverless cars do not have the instances and emotions as humans. Cars cannot see what lies 500 feet in front of them, only humans can see that. Technology fails too much and letting cars drive for us poses to great of a threat at this time.",0,27
"The main advantages that people seem to find in the less use of cars is that the bad and harmful emissions given off are being reduced. The amount of emissions entering our air daily is beyond belief. In Germany, passenger cars are guilty of 12 percent of the emissions; while here in America we give off 57 percent. Germany has made the change to allow you to have a car if it is parked in a city garage not near the living quarters, or you can pay $40,000 to have your own ""large"" garage. All malls, stores and parks are just within a walking distance. With the decrease in the number of cars, the access of public transportation has risen. Paris has recently joined this trend. Days after the record amount of pollution in the air clean air was just a must for these people. The next day you were ordered to leave your cars in the garage, or you would be fined a fine of 22 euros(31 dollars).

Within the lack of cars moving around the people, digestion was down 60 percent in as little as 5 days. 27 people wanted to avoid the fine, so they had their cars impounded. France blamed the Diesel fuel. Dismal makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The goal is to promote alternative transportation. The idea that transportation emissions need to go away has led to this,"" these people are generating a revolutionary change. This change is crossing our borders.""

"Title: Suburban Life Beyond Cars: A Green and Healthy Pathway 

The contemporary world and its patterns of urbanization and mobility have evolved primarily around the use of cars. Cities and suburbs are populated with extensive parking areas and highways, designed to accommodate automobile use. However, there is a shift towards limiting car usage due to numerous socio-economic and environmental benefits as demonstrated by examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States.

In Vauban, an experimental suburb in Germany, the idea of “smart planning” takes center stage as residents give up on cars, leading to a more peaceful, tension-free community (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 1-4). This has become possible through a city layout with reduced space for cars and widespread public transportation systems. The focus is on making suburbs more compact and bring shops a walkaway, which not only improves accessibility but also significantly reduces greenhouse emissions from cars (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5-7).

In Paris, smog pollution led authorities to enforce a partial driving ban during a day, creating a significant reduction in congestion and demonstrating an approach to smog reduction (Duffer, “Paris bans driving due to smog” 10, 14). Similarly, in Colombia, the annual car-free day when only buses and taxis are allowed has played a vital role in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Silky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" 21, 23-24). 

American cities too are witnessing change. There has been a decline in car purchasing and more people are driving less (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 29-30), largely due to changing social attitudes and improved public transportation. With this shift, the demand for cars is likely going to decrease further, while encouraging a long-term cultural shift of less car usage (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 34-35).

Therefore, limiting car usage brings a multitude of benefits. One of the main advantages is the significant environmental impact. Car emissions are one of the major contributors to harmful greenhouse gases, causing global warming and air pollution (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" 5). Reducing car usage benefits not only the environment but also public health, as demonstrated by the decreased smog levels in Paris and Bogotá. 

Socio-economically, mobility shifts within communities also lead to changes in living habits that promote healthier, more active lifestyles, driving positive community bonds. Opportunities for businesses to thrive are also visible, with public transport facilities, carpooling apps and car-sharing programs becoming more appealing in a car-reduced society (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"" 37). 

In sum, severely reducing car usage leads to healthier, more sustainable, and more cohesive cities and suburbs. Although these adjustments may seem challenging, the adoption of public transport services and smart-planning, supplemented by forward-looking regulations and policies can make the transition smooth and beneficial, nudging us towards a greener, healthier and more resilient future.",1,30
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer serves the needs of the American people.

The Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. At the time, the country was much smaller and less diverse than it is today, and there was no way to ensure that a popular vote would be fair and representative of the will of the people.

However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary or appropriate. The country is now much larger and more diverse, and we have the technology to conduct a fair and accurate popular vote. In fact, most other democracies in the world elect their leaders by popular vote.

There are many reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is undemocratic. In a popular vote, every vote would count equally. But in the Electoral College, a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. For example, a voter in Wyoming has 3.6 times more power than a voter in California.

Second, the Electoral College can lead to presidents who do not win the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In that election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states. This is because a candidate can win the presidency with just 270 electoral votes, and it is much easier to win a majority of the electoral votes by winning a few swing states than by winning the popular vote nationwide.

Fourth, the Electoral College is confusing and difficult to understand. Many Americans do not understand how it works, and even those who do understand it often find it unfair.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that should be abolished. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the president by popular vote.

Thank you for your time.

"While driverless cars present some benefits, on the whole their development should be approached cautiously. 

According to the article, autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents substantially since 90% of crashes are currently caused by human error. Without human involvement in operation, vehicles could communicate with each other to coordinate movement efficiently and prevent collisions. This safety aspect is an important consideration. 

However, the technology also raises serious concerns that have not been fully addressed. Privacy is one issue, as driverless cars would rely on sensors and data collection to function, allowing personal information to be tracked. More significantly, turning over control of vehicles to computers may have unforeseen consequences. While programmers aim to account for every scenario, it is impossible to predict every situation that could arise on roads with other human drivers still in control of most vehicles. Autonomous systems may make mistakes that result in accidents or even fatalities through no intentional fault of their own. Until the technology is proven to match or exceed human abilities in all conditions, this risk cannot be ignored.

Perhaps the wisest approach is to advance driverless cars gradually through rigorous testing before widespread adoption, especially since the legal responsibility in accidents would be complex to determine. Developers must ensure that these vehicles can respond appropriately to any situation, with appropriate safeguards against data privacy violations or technical failures. Only once autonomous driving is conclusively demonstrated to be as safe or safer than human ability in all typical driving contexts should significant integration into our transportation system be considered. While promising benefits exist, premature or careless deployment could have devastating outcomes that outweigh any advantages. Overall the technology demands further refinement before relying on it extensively.

In conclusion, driverless cars show potential to reduce accidents but also introduce novel safety and ethical concerns. A cautious approach prioritizing thorough testing is prudent before large-scale implementation or dependence on autonomous vehicles. The complexity demands careful consideration of all factors to ensure public well-being as this transformative technology progresses.",1,33
"Even though driverless cars are coming in the near future and have a lot of positive and negative aspects in my opinion I support the development for driverless cars. To convey why Driverless cars are a good thing is because is can save a lot of time and fossil fuel and is a lot more convent. For instance when the author states that, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and far more flexibility than a bus. This line states how driveless cars can change the world for better and are going to be more apart then riding the bus.

Some more interesting facts about the smart cars that make me more support it is when the passage talks about the Driving and the Assisting. For instance author talks about how,""Traffic Jam Assistant."" ""The can handle driving functions at the speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" I think this is a good thing because it makes driving more a lot more safe for the driver, but at the same time does not sacrifice the drivers control of the car, and it will alert you if you need to take control of the car, which I think is very important, so there won't be any accidents.

To argue why would you need a driverless car if you can just drive yourself is a very important question. Driverless Cars can be helpful and can maybe even save your life if you come across some reckless driver on the road. For example when passage states how, Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" This line describes how the driverless Cars have many safety features and can be automatic turned off just in case of emergencies, which makes it even more convenient and a lot safer for the driver.

To summarize my argument on self driving cars is that I think it's going to be a huge advancement for humanity and will improve our lifestyles for the better. The features in the passage that describes these smart cars such as the heads-up display, which is entiretantment system and information system which, can be turned off automatically in case of emergencies. Also, the Antilock brake and driver assistance, which can save a lot of lives.

These safety features are going to make driverless cars a success. Driverless cars are going to be apart part for the future and will improve the way we drive and our action as well and save many lives.  ",0,34
"As a fellow citizen, I strongly believe that limiting car usage is essential for our community. The passages provided offer numerous reasons to support this idea.

Firstly, using cars less often can improve our health significantly. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Walking and cycling are excellent ways to stay active, and by limiting car usage, we can incorporate these activities into our daily routine. Moreover, the exercise we get from walking and cycling can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

Secondly, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases that contribute to climate change and damage our respiratory health. The European Cyclists' Federation states that cycling emits 5-10 times less CO2 than driving a car. By choosing to cycle or walk instead of driving, we can significantly decrease the amount of air pollution in our community.

Thirdly, limiting car usage can benefit our economy. According to the European Commission, cycling and walking can reduce traffic congestion, which costs businesses and individuals time and money. In addition, investing in cycling infrastructure can create jobs and stimulate local economies. By promoting cycling and walking, we can boost our community's economy and create a more prosperous future.

Lastly, limiting car usage can improve our quality of life. The passage from the European Commission also states that cycling and walking can improve our mental health and overall well-being. By spending less time in cars and more time outdoors, we can reduce stress levels, improve our mood, and enjoy the beauty of nature.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is crucial for our health, environment, economy, and quality of life. By choosing to walk or cycle instead of driving, we can make a positive impact on our community and create a better future for ourselves and future generations. I urge all citizens to join me in this effort and embrace a healthier, more sustainable way of living.",1,35
"Education is a life-long process that helps us learn new things and develop new skills. I definitely agree that education is a life-long process. There are always new things to learn, and we can always improve our skills.

One reason why I agree that education is a life-long process is that technology is always changing. We have to keep up with the latest technologies if we want to be successful in today's world. For example, if we want to work in a field that requires computer skills, we need to keep learning about new software and tools.

Another reason why I agree that education is a life-long process is that the world is always changing. We need to stay up-to-date on current events and understand how the world works if we want to be successful. For example, if we want to work in a field like international relations, we need to be familiar with different cultures and understand the complex geopolitical landscape.

Finally, I think that education is a life-long process because it helps us develop new skills. We can always become better at problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. For example, if we want to become a better leader, we can take courses in leadership development.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process that helps us learn new things, develop new skills, and stay up-to-date on current events. It's essential for success in today's world.

"Have you ever been torn between multiple things to say or do? I have, but I went to my family for the help I needed. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present.

Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. In order to make the best decision, you must go to the people you trust the most: your family. Family is always there for you, even when life seems at it's lowest. Asking the younger members in your family for advice might not be the brightest choice to make, but going to your elders is the best possible choice to make while seeking advice. Looking up to your elder family members is the best thing you can do when seeking opinions because, they have the most knowledge about how to act socially, and you know that you can fully trust them with what you're telling them. An instance where your elders come in, is what to say and when. Almost all teenagers have been made fun of or been in some form of drama and, they don't know what to say back to the bullies. That's where your elders come in. Your elders already know what it's like to feel that way, so they understand greatly. They give you multiple opinions and options to choose from when confronting the bullies. Many teenagers, including me have successfully stood up to bullies after talking with elder family members.

Let's face it, we've all had to face some terrifying situations and, we didn't know what to do. But we all have our families to guide us to make the right choices. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. Next time that you're being faced with a challenge, go to your family. They will support you no matter what.",0,37
"Success is not a one-size-fits-all concept. It varies from person to person, depending on the goals they set for themselves. Some may view success as achieving financial stability, while others may consider it as having a happy family life. Therefore, I fully agree that true success can be measured primarily in terms of the goals one sets for oneself. In this essay, I will provide several reasons and examples to support my stance.

Firstly, setting goals for oneself is crucial for achieving success. Without setting goals, we tend to go through life aimlessly without any clear direction of where we are going. Setting goals, on the other hand, gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life. It also helps us to prioritize our time and resources towards achieving our desired outcome. For instance, a student who sets a goal to achieve a certain grade in a particular course will work hard towards attaining that goal by studying regularly, attending classes, and seeking help when necessary.

Secondly, measuring success based on personal goals provides a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. When we achieve the goals we set for ourselves, we feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This feeling of self-fulfillment is essential for our overall well-being and sense of purpose in life. For example, a person who sets a goal to run a marathon and trains for months to achieve that goal will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon completing the race.

Moreover, setting personal goals allows us to measure our progress and make necessary adjustments. By setting specific goals, we can measure our progress and determine if we are on the right track. If we are not making progress, we can adjust our strategies and change our approach to achieve our desired outcome. For instance, a person who sets a goal to lose weight can track their progress by regularly weighing themselves and measuring their waistline. If they are not making progress, they can adjust their diet and exercise routine to achieve their goal.

On the other hand, if success were to be measured solely based on external factors such as wealth, status, or fame, it would be difficult to achieve true success. The reason is that these factors are often beyond our control, and we may not have the necessary resources or opportunities to attain them. However, by setting personal goals, we can focus on what we can control and work towards attaining them.

In conclusion, true success can be measured primarily in terms of the goals one sets for oneself. Setting personal goals is crucial for achieving success, measuring progress, and making necessary adjustments. It also provides a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment when we achieve the goals we set for ourselves. Therefore, it is essential to set personal goals and work towards achieving them.

"I am in grade 8 and I would like to talk about the issue of gun control, which is a highly contentious topic in many countries. I am in favor of stricter gun control laws because I believe that this will help reduce the number of deaths caused by guns.

One reason why I support stricter gun control laws is that it will make it harder for criminals to obtain guns. If there are more background checks and waiting periods for purchasing a gun, then criminals will have a harder time getting their hands on one. This will ultimately reduce the amount of gun-related crime in our society.

Furthermore, stricter gun control laws will also make it harder for people with mental health issues to get guns. If we have more thorough background checks and screenings, then we can prevent mentally ill individuals from purchasing guns. This will help reduce the number of mass shootings that are often committed by mentally unstable individuals.

Lastly, I believe that stricter gun control laws will also help reduce accidental shootings. If there are more regulations and requirements for gun owners to properly store their guns, then this will reduce the likelihood of accidental shootings occurring, especially around children.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are necessary for our society. They will make it harder for criminals to obtain guns, help reduce gun-related crime and mass shootings, and also reduce the likelihood of accidental shootings occurring.",1,39
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of implementing a four-day work week in schools:

Hey, so like, have you heard about this thing where schools might start having a four-day work week? I know, it sounds kinda weird, but I think it could be pretty cool. I mean, think about it, we'd have more time to hang out with our friends, do stuff we like, and just chill. But, there are also some pretty big pros and cons to it, so we have to think about that too.

First, let's talk about the good stuff. If schools had a four-day work week, we'd have more time to do stuff outside of school. Like, I love playing video games and watching YouTube videos, and with an extra day off, I could do that even more. Plus, my parents are always bugging me to help with chores and stuff, and with an extra day, I could get more stuff done without feeling so overwhelmed. And, let's be real, who doesn't love having an extra day to sleep in and relax? It's like, the best.

But, there are also some pretty big cons to it. Like, teachers and other staff members might not be super happy about it. They might have to work longer hours on the days they are in school, which could be pretty tough. And, some people might be worried about how it could affect their grades and stuff. I mean, if we're not in school as much, might we not learn as much? That's a pretty big concern.

And, there's also the thing about money. I know schools need money to run and stuff, and if they have a four-day work week, they might not have as much money to spend on things like supplies and stuff. That could be pretty bad.

So, like, overall, I think a four-day work week in schools could be pretty cool, but we have to think about all the pros and cons and make sure it's going to be good for everyone. I mean, we don't want teachers and staff to be super stressed out or for students to not learn as much. It's like, a pretty big decision",1,40
"Dear Principle,

I think that the principle is being unfair because students are actually trying there best on having good grades. I think he should give them one more chance because there trying best. If you don't do anything about them, we would were going to sign a petition and were going to get the whole students get it sigh even the teachers. If you still don't let them play a sport then were going to get our super attended on this and I know he would do something about it because he's nice. He's going to see that were trying our best on our grades.

So either you want to do it the nice way or you want to do it the bad way? It's your choice were just letting you know before we go and do it the bad way. It's not fair that you're taking our sports away from us that's the only good thing we have in school and friends so please I'm asking nicely don't take our sports away from us.

We promise were going to try our best on getting a better grade then before. We promise were going to stay to tutoring at least twice a week if we have to we don't really care because we don't want to lose our sport.

Furthermore, we fight for what we want please give us another chance?

"Working in a group can be beneficial in an academic setting as it allows for increased collaboration, creativity, and new perspectives. By discussing tasks, researching topics, or completing tasks together, it can significantly increase the quality and efficiency of the work. For example, if working on a group project in an Introduction to Psychology class, different members can bring their unique viewpoints and perspectives, allowing the final project to be more comprehensive and creative than if one student had completed the project alone. 

However, there can be drawbacks to working in a group. In addition to the potential challenge of coordinating schedules and meeting times, other issues can arise, such as potential discrepancies between the amount of work each person contributes and the weight of each member's contribution. This could lead to conflict and a less than ideal outcome. For example, if two people in a group are especially invested in a project, but the other two contribute little effort, the final result could be negatively impacted. 

In conclusion, although working in an academic setting with a group can be beneficial in several ways, the potential issues within the group may outweigh any potential benefits in some cases.",1,42
"I would like our election to be cast on popular vote. It would make more sense for us to be able to elect our president by what everyone thinks and not the electoral college because many things can go wrong. The votes in electoral college don't make sense big states have more votes than the little ones so the candidates focus on big states and the other ones are left out because they have two or three votes. That's why I think we need a different system or just cast it on popular vote.

Just like the 2000s election Bush won that by getting the bigger states when Gore should've won it because he had more popular votes. The electoral college makes no sense and should be taken down. Many people disagree with the electoral college and know it's a big scam for the presidents to win by losing. That's why it should be cast on popular so it's fair for people and not on the size of your state.

The electoral college is an outdated, unfair system on voting. It shouldn't be about the state but what all the country thinks. Popular vote is the best way to calculate who should be president and who not to be. Our nation would be better off with a new system because the electoral college is getting outdated and isn't a good way to vote for who leads our country. We need a new system because in several places they have never seen a candidate or ad to vote in 2000 campaign. Those states didn't see anything because of their electoral votes are small compared to those of the bigger states.

Also, you can tie the votes in electoral votes, and then we'd have to worry about the vote our House of Representatives would give us. That could be a disaster for us to worry about. Just like Nixon and Clinton had 43 percent of popular vote but winning in the electoral college. It's not fair for most people, and it doesn't make sense how he can win but still be losing at the same time. I wouldn't vote until this system is changed because it is completely unfair.

The electoral college is an unfair system that no one wants anymore. We can change our ways of voting, so it'll be more fair, and it matters on our country's thoughts not our states. Popular vote seems more reasonable and a better way for us to find a good leader. That's why I think it should be cast on popular vote instead of the electoral college and the United States of America would be better off with what our whole country thinks instead of our size because we represent freedom and need to prove it.",0,43
"Dear TEACHER_NAME I agree with you're choice to not allow students to participate in sports and other activities because it will both encourage the students who are already working hard to keep doing so, and it will urge the students who are not doing well to try harder. I think that as a result of your choice more students will try harder in all of their classes, but I also see why you should not make that choice based on the effect it will have on the students. For the students who are doing well they might turn into bullies and start to pick on the students who are not doing so well. For the students who are not doing well it may depress them in two ways one way it could affect them is making them a target for bullies and that ties into the second effect sadness which can lead to the even greater plummet into them failing and then depression and lack of confidence. My stance is that you should change the policy.  ",0,44
"Being a good person and a good citizen are two important qualities that people should strive for in life.

" It is true that many students desire to graduate early with all the necessary credits, but few are able to achieve this due to the high standards required. While some may prefer to take the full four years of high school to graduate, others would like to take the shorter route and still obtain all the necessary credits. However, achieving this goal is not an easy task, and it requires a significant amount of effort and dedication.

In my opinion, it would be beneficial for students to have the option to graduate with three years of high school, provided that they are willing to put in the extra effort to complete the required courses. By doing so, they would be able to finish their high school education earlier and move on to college, work, and a career at a younger age. This would be particularly advantageous for students who do not enjoy spending too much time on schoolwork and would like to achieve their goals more quickly.

I have seen firsthand the benefits of early graduation. Some of my friends have graduated early due to their excellent grades, which gave them enough credits to graduate. They are now in college, pursuing their dreams and achieving their goals. I believe that it would be a good idea to give other students the same opportunity if they choose to take it.

In conclusion, while graduating early with all the necessary credits is a challenging task, it is definitely achievable with hard work and dedication. Providing students with the option to graduate with three years of high school would be a valuable addition to the educational system, as it would allow students to finish their high school education earlier and move on to the next stage of their lives.",1,46
"Mona Lisa's facial expressions were ""determined"" by the Facial Action Coding System. It determined that she was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent anger"" (D'Alto). This super high-tech machine can identify your emotions based on analyzing the muscles in your face. But is the technology really needed in classrooms?

The knowledge of emotional expressions to teachers can be very beneficial. Everyone knows that kids don't learn the same and keep up at the same pace. Teachers could use this for kids to know how comfortable they are with the lesson. In the text it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor'"" (D'Alto). This shows that FACS can help students who don't understand the lesson, by looking at their facial expressions, and changing the lesson to fit them.

Others would argue that facial expressions for every person and emotion are different. As the author pointed out in the text, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (D'Alto), people will disbelieve because not every person shows the same emotion the same way. Some opposers would argue that the addition of the system to education would drastically bring up the cost. Making schools more expensive and put schools at an advantage.

Although I agree that not every face makes the same expression,

FACS can identify the way the muscles move to indicate the emotion. In the text it states, ""This process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto). This quote shows how the system works and to identify the muscle movement in your face. While, yes the cost of education will increase due to the addition of FACS, the benefits will outlay the costs. Like any technological addition to schools, they use funds and sponsors to help pay for that stuff. Helping kids find a new way to learn and helping them succeed, seems a lot more important than costs.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System will help teachers and students worldwide succeed. When teachers know how to fix their lessons based on how their students learn, it makes the job easier for them, and they get to see their students grow. Although the FACS was able to identify Mona Lisa's facial expressions, they can be used for so much more in the real world.  ",0,47
"Computer games are loved by children and Adults alike. The reason why they are so popular is mainly because they are a great way for children to learn new things and have fun. However, some people think that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual as well as psychological development. Consequently, they suggest that effective measures should be taken to prevent children from playing them.

One of the most common problems that computer games can cause is that they can be very addictive. Children who are addicted to computer games often find it hard to break the habit. This can lead to them spending more and more time playing the game, which can cause them to lose touch with reality. It also can make them less motivated to learn or do other things.

Another common problem is that computer games can be very dangerous. Children who play computer games often do not know what they are getting themselves into. They can become very injured or even killed. This can have a very negative effect on their development, both physically and mentally.

Most of the people who argue that computer games have negative effects on children's development are not actually children themselves. They are adults who have already had some experience with computer games. These people are usually people who are not interested in helping children grow up healthy and happy.

One of the best ways to prevent children from playing computer games is to make sure that they are not really interested in them. This can be done by education. It is also important to make sure that the games that children play are not too dangerous. If they are, then they should be removed from the classroom.

Finally, it is important to remember that computer games are not the only things that can be bad for children. Other things that can also have a negative effect on their development include television, books, and other forms of communication. Therefore, it is important that parents be aware of the dangers that computer games pose to their children.

"Cell Phone Use While Driving

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using any kind of possibly distracting technology while operating a vehicle can put the driver, and others, at serious risk. Many people do not fully understand the risks that come with using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. While distracted driving they could hit someone or something, possibly leaving the driver and that person or thing seriously injured, damaged, or dead. These are just a few reasons for why drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In 2015, the NSC estimated that cell phone use while driving, alone, accounted for 27% of all car crashes in the United States and 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities. Also in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 310,000 people injured in accidents involving distracted driving. In the U.S. nine people are killed each day from distracted driving. Car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.S. This distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. These statistics rise every year. And with technological advances in cars, radios, phones, etc., there are many things that can easily distract any driver. Drivers should keep in mind that it is okay to leave a text unread for a couple of minutes in order to safely respond when the vehicle is stopped and off the road. Or pull over if it is important to respond quickly. There is rarely an emergency so severe and emergent that a person would need to put themselves and others at risk of serious injury or even death, because if something happens to that person, they can not help in an emergency situation anyway.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is extremely dangerous and risky. Drivers are not only putting them self in harm's way when using a cell phone while driving, but they are also putting other's lives and safety on the line. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.  ",0,49
"Students are usually on their phones and doing other mindless tasks during summer break, and they don't stimulate their brains. As a result, some schools assign summer projects to ensure that their students learn over the summer and are better prepared for the next school year. These schools debate on assigning teacher-designed projects, which have specific guidelines, or student-designed projects, which allow for more creative freedom. These summer projects should be student-designed because students would be able to personalize their projects, the projects would be more enjoyable, and the students would put in more effort into their products.

With student-designed projects, students are able to express their own creative styles. For example, in an interior design class, the summer project could be to design the students' dream house. One student may excel in drawing, so they could draw their dream house. Another student may excel in graphic design, so they could create a three-dimensional model of their dream house on a computer. Lastly, another student may like Legos, so they could build their dream house out of Legos. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects would minimize the creative freedom because they would set specific guidelines on how they want their students to complete it. All in all, students can complete their projects using the unique skills they have with student-designed projects.

Also, students would find the projects more fun if they are able to design it. Summer break is a time for students to have fun. When a teacher designs a project, there are usually set guidelines on how they want the project, which sometimes isn't what students would enjoy. This would make it difficult for students to find the motivation to complete their projects, especially over summer break. On the other hand, with student-designed projects, students would be able to personalize their projects, so they could use their own interests to complete it. When students are able to individualize their projects, they find it more enjoyable to complete since they would include aspects that they enjoy and minimize aspects of the project they could potentially dislike. For example, in the previously mentioned interior design summer project, the student who excels in drawing could dislike using computers. If the teacher had required the dream house to be made on the computer, the drawer could find it difficult to finish the project because they don't enjoy using computers. In contrast, if the drawer was able to design their own project, then they could draw their dream house while having fun.

Lastly, in student-designed projects, students would put more effort into completing their projects. Generally, students put more effort into the subjects that they enjoy. Similarly, if students are able to design their own projects, they would enjoy completing the projects and work harder on them. If the previously mentioned interior design teacher required everyone to build their dream house out of Legos, the student who draws and the student who enjoys graphic design would enjoy the project less and find little motivation to complete it over the summer. As a result, the drawer and graphic designer would put minimal effort into their Lego dream house, for they may just build a house with little detail and minimal unique thinking. On the other hand, if the dream house project was a student-designed project, the students would put a lot of effort into creating their dream house since they are able to design it with the skills that they have and enjoy using.

Some may argue that students could design the summer projects, so they require minimum effort since they want to complete their projects as quickly as possible. However, when you give students creative freedom, they are more likely to put in extra effort because they would enjoy their projects more. Schools that require summer projects should assign student-designed projects because students are able to use their unique skills and interests to complete these projects. Additionally, students would have more fun completing these projects since they are allowed to express their own creativeness, which helps motivate the students to complete it during summer break. Lastly, students are more likely to work harder on their projects because they would find their student-designed projects more enjoyable to complete.",0,50
"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering two new phone policies. Policy 1 is about letting us, the students, bring our phones to school and being able to use them at lunch and other free times. While Policy 2 is not letting us have our phones at all while at school. As a student myself I have to agree more with Policy 1. Letting us use our phones during lunch and other free times would let us communicate more with each other. During class most of what we think about is probably what we are going to say to our friends the next time we see them. Since we have no time to coordinate where to go for free time with our friends we might miss them. If we could use our phones to text them we could meet up. A friend that is sick and missing classes might want to catch up on work, so they don't get too far behind. The friend at school could call them at lunch or free time and tell them if anything important is going on. Along with telling them about school work, we wouldn't want them to get too bored, now, would we? Our friends are how we get through the day. They are what makes us look at the white board and say ""I can get this. I can learn."" When we are lost they're the ones who put us back on track and the ones who show us the way. If you allow us to use our phones outside the classroom they can do all of these things from across the school, and I'm sure that we would do much better inside the classroom. Phones are the way that we keep up our friendships with those that we never see. I have a friend that the only time I see her is if we happen to go to the same place for free time. Once in a while we will run into each other in the hall and say where to meet but only like once a month. All her classes are upstairs while mine are all downstairs and on the other side of the school. Can you guess the way we've stayed in contact? Yep, that's right, cell phones! To some it may sound stupid and cheesy, but cell phones are what keeps our lives together. Unless you would rather put all friends together in one classroom, I think the best way to go is Policy 1.

He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke went on his first trip in August 1945 when he had orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and the other crew members arrived on the 14th of August 1945. It took about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

While Luke was on a trip to Greece he had his 18th birthday, Luke could've gone to the military, but his draft board told him to stay. By the time Luke was discharged he had been on 9 cattle boat trips, that is the most of a sea going cowboy.",0,52
"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth and is also referred to as our sister planet. We have sent many probes to Venus, yet many have not survived more than a few hours. Venus may be very close to us compared to other planets in our solar system, but it is far different in its characteristics. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author shows how Venus is dangerous but still worthy of studying by giving us evidence and examples about Venus and its features.

The author gives us statistical evidence on how our planet is different from Venus. He explains that its temperature, atmosphere, and its acidic clouds are making the planet uninhabitable for humans. The author writes, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (3) The other spits out many facts that support his claim that exploring Venus is a very dangerous job. 800 degrees Fahrenheit is very hot and would not EB suitable by a human. In fact, all of these features would make it hard for a human to live on Venus. All these points can help prove that Venus is still worthy of studying even though there are many dangers because it should interest scientists and others to find out how these conditions came to be, what could survive in these harmful conditions, and even possibly how to make it possible for humans to live there.

The author also uses examples to support his claim that Venus is inhospitable for humans. Humans have many needs in order to survive on a planet and Venus does not qualify for many. The author writes ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" (3) In this quote the either is referring to the pressure of the planet inside the atmosphere. If a submarine could not survive the pressure, I doubt a human could either. The author also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system"" and it has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This is impressive because even probes that are specifically made for going to Venus, can't even survive on Venus. This proves that Venus is very dangerous but still worthy of studying because it challenges scientists to find new ways of making stronger probes and new ways to study this planet that prove effective.

The author uses many pieces of statistical evidence and examples to prove his point that Venus is worthy of studying even considering the dangerous conditions. It is worthy because it has insanely harsh temperature, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and other harmful characteristics. Would you want to study Venus considering its deadly differences?",0,53
"Imagine being on a vacation in the Bahama's and realize that you have to finish two book reports by the end of the trip. Now your vacation is totally ruined! You now are going to have to postpone relaxing and having fun, because you have to do school work before classes even start. The majority of schools around the country include summer learning assignments; which purposes as a way to help students get ready for their upcoming classes. This could include a genre of ideas of work to be assigned that teachers could choose from. Most student's don't enjoy these projects; since, most kids don't want to start thinking about school until, the doors are open again. They would usually prepare you at a younger age with summer reading to help the gradual adjustment to essays, projects, and many more, easier to do. The issue is that, more and more students forget or never finish, these summer homework assignments, due to the lack of enjoyment or increased procrastination. So if you could choose your own project, would it be more likely that you would complete it?

If students could create their own homework assignments, what would it look like? A student could choose topics such as, sports, television, friends, family, location, or anything else that they could think of. Maybe if teachers assigned essays over break, students could choose what to write about. For instance, maybe they would like to explain what they did during summer or, describe their favorite sport, food, TV show, and even create a bibliography about themselves. I know that many students still wouldn't enjoy writing or reading over their summer vacation; but, what if a student could choose to do anything they wanted, instead of writing. They could make a picture collage, poster, PowerPoint, painting, or whatever they'd want, to show how their vacation is going or why they like a particular topic. If your school let you pick what to work on during break, what would you choose?

Why do students prefer not to do these assignments in the first place? What are teachers asking kids to do that's so uninteresting? Since you started enrolling in school, your teachers would choose to give you work during summer break. This was to help kids be more comfortable before starting the following school year. It usually starts with summer reading to help lead up to research projects or essays. If you're about to start entering AP classes, you're more likely to have more difficult assignments. If you're not taking an honor or AP class, it's less likely you're going to be given summer projects. Kids could tend do be less interested due to amount or difficulty they're given. What's the hardest assignment your teachers given you?

The real question is, how could we persuade school districts to allow these types of learning assignments? My school's county has social media accounts such as,

Instagram and Twitter, that will inform parents, faculty, staff, and students, important messages about our community. If your school has a social media account, try to contact them or research your suggestion, so you could to see if your idea could even be possible. Getting a message back from a school social media account, can be harder than finding the answers you were looking for online. You could always ask a teacher, guidance councilor, or anyone at your school, to help you with any of your issues, including learning suggestions. If I was in this position, I would tweet at my county's Twitter or direct message them, to try to get the answers I'm looking for.

At last, it's 2020, and our goal on easier summer projects, hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. We have self-driving cars and miniature robots to plan, remind, and clean for ourselves; but, we can't make school work more comfortable for summer. If we want to show our country that there's an easier way to prepare ourselves for school, we need to create an impressive thought out plan. We can figure out our main idea and focusing points, to later show our school counties all over the country, how important this subject is. Students just want a more relaxing and entertaining way to learn over their summer vacation, so why aren't we doing it?  ",0,54
"Dear Principal:

Word on the street is that you're considering banning cell phones from school campus. Now, you know as well as I do that the students are NOT happy about this at all. But I'm sure that that alone is not enough to convince you to let our cell phones be. That's why I'm writing to you about a policy that will allow cell phones on school ground, with a few limits, that will satisfy everyone.

First off, let me tell you why banning cell phones altogether is a bad idea. The students will be infuriated if that idea is put into motion, and will not only defy the rule, but a handful of students might actually do worse things, such as texting in class. You see, if you take away something from the students, they'll not only continue bringing that said something, they will, just to show that they don't care what the school administration does, do worse things. It's just the way students my age are, and I'm sure the younger grades are just the same way.

Plus, a lot of us actually need cell phones; many students are part of after-school programs or clubs, and they need to call their parents to gain permission to stay. In fact, a lot of students know when and when not to use their phones, and go along with it. It's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule of using cellular devices during class. The rest of us know the rules and why it exists and respect that. The rest of us want to learn, and do learn.

Now, I propose an alternative to the ""no phone"" policy you are considering: let us keep our phones, but don't let us use them in inappropriate times, like in class. Let us continue bringing cell phones to school on the condition that we don't use them unless needed. I'm sure that we will be mature about this and honor your decision if you choose this rule. I promise you that if there are students that can't be grateful for the merciful decision you made, those will be minimal and can be dealt easily with ninth hour or lunch detention.

In conclusion, I thank you for your time in reading this letter, and I'm sure you'll choose the better option. Remember, it's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule.

Thanks for reading,

"I think it is very valuable because it knows if you're happy or sad which helps in a lot of ways. Another interesting example would be ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""and the technology is so good it can make computer animated faces more expressive according to the text and can too for surgery videos. And the computer may not detect your emotional communication but noted Dr. Huang said ""so computers need to understand that too.

""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and all 44 important muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""it also says that we may sometimes not really know what is wrong with our friends, and sometimes we can because of their facial expression. Or just behavior in general but sometimes they don't want to show that emotion or what is in them the computer can detect all of that.

So I personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldn't really express there selves to the class as if they were with their friends. So all we would have to do is just by a single glimpse on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happened. And she doesn't really know what to do so she seeks help from a counselor, and she just checks what is going on with her and just by that maybe her whole life could change by checking the computer. Tech is advancing a lot and is helping the Socrata positively and yet negatively but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but motive stuff.  ",0,56
"Dear Principal

I think to make the school system better that community service is a good idea to do because. The students learn more about staying out of trouble. Because when you are in trouble u see that u will steal have work to no matter what because staying is not a good thing, so they show you by making you do community service. And maybe that will show you how to stay out of trouble and some people in joy doing community service because it makes them feel better about. Helping other and just cleaning is always helpful to your community to show how you care, and you want things to look better to show that you have a great community, and you like keeping it clean, and you would like others in your community to do the same to show that you care. Then if the community is clean maybe new people will come and like what they see about your community and would like to move in. So yes to me community service is a good idea.",0,57
"The stability of a society is determined by various factors, including economic stability, political stability, social stability, and cultural stability. However, one of the critical factors that can affect the sustainability of a society is how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that the stability of a society depends on how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my answer.

Firstly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can determine how well it can maintain law and order. In any society, there will always be individuals who may exhibit deviant behavior that can threaten the peace and stability of that society. These behaviors include acts of violence, terrorism, theft, and other forms of criminal activities. The response of the society to these behaviors will determine whether they will continue or not. For example, if a society responds to these behaviors by increasing security measures, punishing offenders, and rehabilitating them, then it will be able to maintain law and order. However, if the society responds to these behaviors with indifference, then it may lead to an increase in such behaviors, which can destabilize the society.

Secondly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can affect the mental and emotional well-being of its citizens. When individuals engage in extreme behaviors, they not only harm themselves but also harm the people around them. This can lead to fear, anxiety, and trauma, which can affect the mental and emotional well-being of the society. The response of the society to these behaviors can either help individuals heal or make them feel more traumatized. For example, if a society responds to an act of terrorism by offering counseling services to the victims and their families, it can help them heal from the trauma. However, if the society responds with hostility and aggression, it can make the situation worse, leading to more trauma.

Thirdly, the response of a society to extreme human behavior can affect its reputation and image. In today's globalized world, the reputation of a society plays a significant role in attracting tourists, investors, and other forms of economic activities. If a society is known for its tolerance and ability to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors, it will attract more people and investments. However, if a society is known for its intolerance and inability to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors, it will drive away people and investments. For example, after the 9/11 attacks in the USA, the response of the society was to increase security measures, punish the offenders, and offer support to the victims and their families. This response helped to restore the reputation of the USA as a tolerant and resilient society.

In conclusion, the stability of a society depends on how it responds to the extremes of human behavior. The response of a society can affect its ability to maintain law and order, the mental and emotional well-being of its citizens, and it's reputation and image. Therefore, it is essential for societies to respond appropriately to extreme behaviors to ensure their sustainability. The appropriate response should be one that promotes healing, tolerance, and resilience rather than hostility and aggression.

"The use of E-dictionaries has become increasingly popular among students today, leading to discussions about its merits and demerits in aiding English learning. Although E-dictionaries provide a convenient and quick way to look up words and check the spelling, I agree with the opinion that it's overuse may have more drawbacks than benefits for English learning.

For one thing, relying too much on E-dictionaries may undermine the motivation to learn English vocabulary. Many E-dictionaries provide the function of translating words and phrases into different languages, which may make it less necessary for students to learn the English words and phrases. This can result in the diminishing of their enthusiasm and motivation in learning English. Moreover, since the translation provided by some E-dictionaries is not always accurate, using them as the only reference may lead to misunderstandings and lead to confusion in the learning process.

Furthermore, overreliance on E-dictionaries may diminish our spelling ability. While it is true that E-dictionaries provide an effective way to check the spelling of words, constant use of the function can lead to over-dependence on it, making students lose confidence in their ability to spell correctly. This, in turn, may cause them to become reluctant in attempting to learn English independently and take more risks in their exploration of the language.

In conclusion, I agree with the opinion that the overuse of E-dictionaries may have more drawbacks than advantages for English learning. Therefore, I believe that English teachers should encourage students to find a balance between the use of E-dictionaries and independent learning and exploration of English.

"Dear State senator, A lot of chatter about weather the president should be elected by electoral college or by popular vote is going around my school for the past couple of weeks, and I can't help but to give my own opinion about this argument. I believe that the popular vote should decide who is the president.

I believe this because of two reasons. One, the citizens are the ones that are going to have to deal with this good or bad president for four years and possibly eight years. Also, the state senators can be bribed by one or the other candidates running for president. This candidate could have the worst plans for the next four years and all because he cheated to win. This could cause riots and prawns around the United States.

Two, Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. What this means is that candidates are not going to focus on the States that they know they won't get any votes from. For example in source TW, during the campaign of 2000, seventeen states were not visited by either candidates, so they didn't get to see any campaign ads. This is unfair because it makes it harder, almost impossible for these states to choose on who to vote for because they had no presentations to choose from. This puts too much power in the candidates hands.

Some may believe otherwise. For example, since the Electoral votes are from very experienced people that have put there life and time into knowing about what is right and wrong. They are much more experience than the normal citizens. Also, Electoral College prevents runoff elections to occur. For example in source three, the electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This causes lots of pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner.

In my own opinion the one that decided the winner is popular votes. There can still be Elector Collage votes, but the Electoral votes have too much power and is unfair to the citizens of the United States.",0,60
"The idea of an entire area having no car owners sounds a little strange to someone living in a big city. Especially a suburban area with no cars, but in places like Vauban, Bogota and even Paris have revolutionized the idea of transportation.

Vauban, Germany-is a suburban area where 70 percent of the families that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only a couple places to park such as large parking garages at the edge of the development where you can buy a parking space for 40,000, and with the purchase of a home. Residents of Vauban such as Hadron Walter, mother of two children says when she owned a car she was always tense and that she is much happier without a car. Vauban is home to 5,500 residents and may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.

Paris, France nearly hit the record for highest polluted city in the world, until they banned the citizens from driving to clear the air of the global city. People who had an even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is $31 in America, the same applied to the odd-numbered plates the following day. Approximately 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in Paris. After 5 days of intensifying smog rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed for the mass pollution, Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban or odd-numbered plates.

In Bogotá, Colombia there is a program that is set to spread to other countries, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work for a car-free day, leaving the large capital city devoid of traffic jams. The goal of this car-free day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, the turnout was successful. Citizens of Bogotá like Carlos Arturo Plaza says it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. For the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. Higher authorities from other countries came to Bogotá to see the event. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" said Enrique Rear, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. Car-free day started in the mid-1990's and as created the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city.

Getting out of your car and taking a walk for a couple miles is something you should consider doing every day. Walking has an insane amount of advantages, it can even save your life. The amount of pollution in the world is doing nothing but rising and the best way to avoid it getting any worse is reducing the amount of driving we do every day.",0,61
"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on individual experiences and preferences. However, in general, young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people are.

There are several reasons for this. Firstly, young people are typically more optimistic and enthusiastic about life than older people are. They are more likely to see the positive aspects of life and to be excited about the future. Secondly, young people are typically more active and energetic than older people are. They are more likely to enjoy physical activities and to be social. Thirdly, young people are typically more open-minded and tolerant than older people are. They are more likely to be interested in different cultures and to be accepting of different people.

All of these factors contribute to the fact that young people generally enjoy life more than older people do. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, and some older people are very active and enthusiastic about life. However, in general, young people are more likely to find joy in life than older people are.

"Character traits are essential tools in determining who we are and how we interact with the world around us. Whether we are consciously choosing our characteristics or they have been molded by our environment, our traits have the potential to profoundly shape our lives.

When individuals take on the task of examining their traits and actively choosing which ones to foster or abandon, they are engaging in the practice of self-development. Being aware and mindful of the qualities that define us and the consequences they may have, allows us to take control of our lives and create our own destiny. These actions can lead to greater autonomy, happiness, and satisfaction with our decisions, as we are empowering ourselves instead of allowing ourselves to be a product of external forces.

On the other hand, when character traits are acquired due to outside circumstances, we are left in a vulnerable state, as we are not in control of the messages conveyed by our traits. Depending on our upbringing, peer group, or societal norms, the traits that form us can be limiting and inhibit us from reaching our desired goals. If we do not question and challenge what has been instilled in us, we may become victim to our own preconceived beliefs and succumb to our environment’s restrictions.

Therefore, it is important for us to become mindful of our character traits, as they play an integral role in determining the direction of our lives. Self-development and intentional self-growth can grant us the freedom to pursue our passions and find fulfillment in our lives.",1,63
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that policy number two is a great policy.

I think this because if students are allowed to have phones it would be a distraction.

First this a good policy because without phones in school it would let students concentrate. Also, because students would be able to do there work without using their phone. This policy would let the students get good grades on their test. Students have the rest of the day after school to use there phone and text. This policy is also great because without having phones it would make this school a better one because it would show that the teachers want the students to do good and have a great future. There are many more great reasons why students should not be allowed to have phones during school.

"Dear Principle,

I have come to notice that our school might be going to do community service projects. I applaud you in the fact you are showing the littler kids that working for your community is a good thing. But it has also come to my attention that are a few students that would rather not do community service because it takes away from there time to do what they like to do. TEACHER_NAME I have found a way that can fix this problem. I propose that we set a day that students can do community service in school.

For example on every third and fourth Wednesday we could set out forty minutes of class time for community service, like tutoring kids. Kids tutoring other kids is a great community service because it helps the student get better grades and will help the school for Fact. Another project we can do is a fun day with the students at the local special needs school. We can have a day were about twenty kids are selected by there grade average to go to the school and have a fun day, with a movie and popcorn, and just a day we could hang out together. TEACHER_NAME as you see these are only some community projects we can do, that is also reason to do this in our school because there are so many options the school could use for community service.

Another reason we should have community service is because it can change people. I believe that sometimes doing one good thing, for someone else, can change someone. So if we have community service some unruly kids could go to a soup kitchen and see that they don't have it that bad and there is no reason to act this way without a pretty good reason or bring them to a detention center and allow them to talk to the kids, and give a small tutoring lesson since they are out of school for a while, and maybe seeing these kids will allow them to see what there doing and change.

The last most important reason I think we should have community service is that in the future the student will have to have it to graduate, so you would be setting them on the path to success.

Thank you and I hope you take this into consideration.

Thank You again.

"Dear Principal,

I think that making students have at least a b average in their classes is wrong. My reasoning for this statement is that most student have trouble getting at least a c average let alone a b average. If you were going to do this there would be a lot less people participating in extracurricular activities therefore less money for your school. Most of the kids participating in your extracurricular activities are jocks not geniuses. There would be a lot of people protesting this issue because without sports and other extracurricular activities a lot of the kids would have not made the friends they have today. These activities are not only about the competition it's about having fun. The schools are trying to promote a healthier lifestyle but without sports the kids would be less active and therefore there would be an increase in the obesity rates. Sports should be a healthy way to be more active not a way to make students spend hours a night studding. If u were to do this you might as well have no extracurricular activities at all because they wouldn't be enough students participating in them. I think the policy should stay the same not make it harder to have a social life. I personally hate the idea of this because school would be less fun without these activities to participate in. Most kids don't like school to begin with so this policy would just make it worse and make more high school drop-outs. These activities are the only way some people are going to get to go to college. In today's tough economy less and fewer students can afford college, so they need the athletic scholarships. You don't want to ruin the students' education, do you? Exactly you're trying to help them not put them down. The educational directors are supposed to promote it not make them not want to even attempt to go to college. Therefore, the policy should stay the same because of all the reasons stated in this letter and on behalf of the students, so thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to read this letter.

"School days can be a drag at times, and can cause a lack of interest and become unmotivated in school. Then at the end of every school day, most of us go home to relax from the day we went through, but sometimes going home to the same old routine can become boring. However, the principal announcing that every student should take an extracurricular activity sounds like a great solution to this, because these activities will allow students to interact with others, introduce students to be able to learn new skill sets, and give students a chance to participate in activities they love.

One reason that the principal's decision is a good idea is because this will allow students to interact with each other more often. Sure, we do that every day during school, but if you were to join a club or group, it would be a great opportunity to make new friends. Since you would be choosing a group based on your interests instead of attending a common subject, this would mean that others in your group would share the same interests as you, which is great for connecting with others. For example, when I was in a little soccer league, I was able to talk and play with others while knowing that they liked the same things that I did, which made me feel included and a part of the team. Being able to interact with others also allow for the improvement of social and teamwork skills. Playing in a sport is a good example of this because of how teammates cooperate with each other to reach their goal and win the game. It can be fun during games when you pass the ball to each other before shooting a goal, making the whole team know that they all made a big contribution during the game.

Another reason that having a required extracurricular is a good idea is how they can give students a chance to find new hobbies and skills. Whatever extracurricular you choose can introduce you to a skill set based off your liking. Say if someone were interested technology, computers, robots and such. They could join a coding or engineering club, which could become a new hobby for themselves. This can also apply to choosing activities out of someone's comfort zone. Students that choose to join groups out of their average liking can lead to the development of a new hobby that they never knew they had. Once when I had to stay after school to attend a concert, so I had to take an activity in the meantime. One of the few choices available was a social study group, which I needed at the time. It turned out to be a pleasant experience while working with others. Gaining new hobbies from extracurricular activities can also skills to help students find what they're going to do in the future. Like if someone were interested in wildlife or animals. That person could join a wildlife conservation group or an awareness group of some sort, so they could be involved with the thing they love and be introduced to a new skill that can also be beneficial in their community and even in their future.

A third reason for why required extracurricular activities are a good idea is that they can allow students to enjoy themselves. Students know how it feels to have to lag through every school day, as well as having to worry about their grades and piling school work. Being in an extracurricular can take your mind off of school in the moments you're in that group, and let you enjoy the time you spend there instead of having to stress yourself out more than you can handle. And, as previously stated, you'll be able to spend time with other students who know what it's like to face unmotivated times in school, home, or any other place. They can all talk to each other and do what interests them while even learning about topics without having piles of work to do afterwards, like in a coding club. And you'll be able to relax more often, or at the very least do what you think is fun. Like make arts and crafts, make or play games, play a sport, help the environment. Whatever you enjoy doing, there's most likely a club just for that. Something that you and any other student can enjoy.

Having to take a required extracurricular activity doesn't seem as bad when you think about it. You're able to be with and connect with others, discover new activities that you didn't even know you would enjoy, and take your mind off of the stressful events going on and enjoy yourself. So if you like the sound of that, then having an extracurricular seems like a great idea that you can give a chance.",0,67
"Dear,

Principle

I think that the students should be allowed to use there cell phones during free time. It is not like they are going to cheat on a test because they are at lunch. But I also think that they really don't need them unless they have to text their parents. They really don't need them because they are at school with all of their friends so who do they need to text because all there friends are with them. Before the students go into class they should have to drop their phones into a bin, so they do not get tempted to text during class. When they have free time they should be able to use them because after all it is free time. They should also be able to use them at lunch because they might need to text there parents or a friend to tell them what time to pick them up or to bring them lunch because they forgot theirs. The second rule about not letting students have a cell phone at school at all is a bad idea to me. They should be able to use there phone because they might need them, and they are the same as going on a computer at lunch because you can still email people and go on the internet. So why should you not be able to use cell phones if you can use computers. I think that you should pass the first policy instead of the second because all the students would enjoy being able to use them at lunch.",0,68
"University education has been a topic of debate for many years, with some people believing that the primary purpose of a university education is to prepare students for employment, while others believe that it has other functions. In my opinion, while preparing students for employment is one of the primary functions of university education, it is not the only function.

To begin with, university education helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. These skills are not only essential for success in the workplace but also in everyday life. For example, university students are required to analyze and evaluate complex information from various sources and make informed decisions. These skills are not only beneficial in the workplace but also in personal and social situations.

Moreover, university education provides students with the opportunity to explore their interests and passions. Students can choose from a wide range of courses and majors, allowing them to pursue their interests and discover new ones. This exploration of interests and passions can lead to personal growth and self-discovery, which is equally important to employment.

Furthermore, university education provides students with the opportunity to engage in research and community service. These activities not only benefit society but also help students develop skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. These skills are highly valued in the workplace and can increase a student's employability.

However, it is undeniable that preparing students for employment is also an important function of university education. Universities provide students with the knowledge and skills required for their chosen profession. Many universities also offer career services, internships, and job placement assistance to help students transition into the workforce.

In conclusion, while preparing students for employment is an important function of university education, it is not the only function. University education provides students with critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, the opportunity to explore their interests and passions, and the chance to engage in research and community service. These functions are equally important to a student's personal and professional growth.

"Driving into the Future

What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self-driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheral vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that process situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and eliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.

Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can process situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival time. Smart cars, as the leading industries call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintain eyes on the road. These cars are maintain a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.

While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safely navigate out of it and override the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.

With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars' people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.

Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, driving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel. I would certainly choose the computer driving me, my friends and coworkers around for my safety and theirs.",0,70
" Four-Day School: A Debate between Benefits and Disadvantages

The debate surrounding the adoption of a four-day school week has been gaining traction in recent years, with many businesses and educational institutions considering the option. While there are certainly advantages to having a shorter school week, there are also potential drawbacks that must be carefully considered before making a decision. In this essay, we will examine the benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week and explore possible solutions to mitigate any negative consequences.

One of the main benefits of a four-day school week is the potential for increased productivity and focus during class time. By reducing the number of school days, students would have more time to devote to their studies and complete assignments more efficiently. Additionally, having an extra day off each week could provide students with the opportunity to catch up on any missed work or seek additional help from teachers or tutors.

Another potential advantage of a four-day school week is the opportunity for students to engage in extracurricular activities or pursue hobbies outside of school. With an extra day off each week, students could have more time to pursue their interests and develop new skills. This could lead to increased creativity, motivation, and overall well-being.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to a four-day school week that must be considered. One potential disadvantage is the potential for reduced attendance and academic performance. If students are not attending school on the fifth day, they may be missing out on important information or falling behind on their coursework. Additionally, teachers may struggle to keep up with the increased workload of teaching for fewer days each week.

Another potential disadvantage of a four-day school week is the potential for increased stress and burnout for both students and teachers. With fewer days off each week, students and teachers may feel more pressure to complete their work and may struggle to find time for rest and relaxation. This could lead to increased stress levels and decreased overall well-being.

To mitigate these potential drawbacks, there are several possible solutions that could be implemented. One option is to extend the school day by two hours each day, which would provide students with more time to complete their work and engage in extracurricular activities. Additionally, schools could offer additional resources or support for students who may be struggling to keep up with their coursework, such",1,71
"""No one cares about the environment."" said no one ever. The environment we live in, whether it's a crowded city like New York, or Paris, or even a regular suburban community, is a wonderful place. There is one issue though that has spread among communities, and that is the high amount of car usage. Having a car and being able to track to great distances in a short amount of time is great, but look at what cars do to the environment. Also, when it comes to buying a car, you're basically throwing your bank account out the window. And don't get me started with the worries of having your children play in the streets.

Now, let's discuss the crazy amount of money you have to throw away on a car. You either throw away a fortune on a good car, that runs good, and then end up taking years to pay it off, or you buy a cheap, beat up car, that is always in need of repair. Either way it is a loose, lose situation. Why buy these insanely priced cars when you can buy a nice bike that moves perfectly. At around five hundred dollars, to a thousand dollars a bike is easily the way to go. A bonus to buying a nice bike instead of a car, is that while you ride your bike, you'll get into shape in no time at all. Now if you need to track a great distance that riding a bike can not get you to fast enough, buses or mobile transport have bike racks on them, so you can ride a bus to the nearest position to where you need to be then simply ride your bike for the remainder of the distance.

The main issue here with cars for most people, is that there is a large amount of pollution that comes with driving a car. In Paris the pollution from cars were so bad that Paris had to put a temporary ban on driving to help clear out all the smog that was in the sky. Also, in America car pollution is the second-largest source of pollution emissions. There is no other way to say it, cars make up a lot of the earths' pollution, and when the time comes that people start to die down on using cars the world will be a much healthier place to be in.

Now you can not tell me that there is not at least one parent who will read this next statement and not agree more. Fewer cars, safer streets. Every mom, dad, brother, sister, or any kind of other relative have worried about their family playing in the streets. There are millions of accidents every year in the world that result in people getting hit by cars and killed, or seriously injured. With fewer cars on the streets the world will be a much safer place for kids, and even adults, as there is drunk drivers you have to look out for, or reckless drivers who don't even have a license.

All together limiting car usage will have multiple benefits to the world, and even your own community. One being you don't have to pay for a car when they start going out of style, another being the worlds' pollution will lower at a huge rate, and last that the roads we live, and breathe on will be a much safer place. Limit your car usage and make the word a better place on step at a time.  ",0,72
"Some of the advantages we get from limiting the uses of cars are, we make cities denser, and safer and better to walk. Without cars people could walk the streets and not have to worry about someone running into them, or they wouldn't have to pay attention to their kids as much as we do today. If we didn't use cars today, we would have less drinking and driving accidents cause if u didn't have a vehicle u wouldn't be able to drive drunk. In the passage hadron Walter said they were happier without a vehicle when they had a vehicle they were always tense 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there vehicles, so they could move.

Cars today have mufflers that blow out smoke to pollute the air Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If u drove any vehicle in Paris the officers would stop u and u would get a fine for 31 dollars. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people had there vehicles impounded just because of there reaction the fine that they were given. Congestion was down to 60 percent in France they had to suffer 5 days of smog china and Beijing was the number one polluted cities in the world. Deisel was the blame for 67 percent of pollution in France.

Paris has more smog than other cities Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79 in London. On the third straight year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis for 7 million people. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If u didn't obey the rules violators were faced with a 25 dollar fine. Soon California and Valledupar joined the no car event. When the countries came to see about the event ta were enthusiastic these people are generating a revolutionary Chang and this is crossing borders said Enrique rear.

Ameria has been rapidly dropping the rat of driving the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily in 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January in 1995. Since transportation is the second-largest source of Americas emissions just behind the power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Companys like ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves mobility companies with a broader product range end the personal vehicle.

New York has an Ike sharing program, and it is skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation. A stud show that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.  ",0,73
"Some people think that taking classes from home is an easy way to study without having to leave home. While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work, not everyone has access to internet, teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.

One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would not be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus on what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.

Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seem good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have an internet source. There could be paces where getting good

Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue has people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.

One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than through the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person. People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.

Meanwhile, people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from is not away a good idea because students would not be inspired, not everyone has access to internet, and teachers would help students more in person. With all said we can conclude that the best way to study is by attending to school and no from home.",0,74
"The advent of social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information. With a few clicks, we can connect with friends and family from around the world, share our thoughts and experiences, and stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends. However, this increased connectivity has come with a cost: the loss of privacy. As a result, there is a growing need for stronger privacy protections on social media platforms.

On one hand, proponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. This includes everything from basic contact information to more sensitive data such as credit card numbers and medical records. Without adequate safeguards in place, this information could be accessed by hackers, identity thieves, and other malicious actors, putting users at risk of financial fraud or even physical harm.

Furthermore, social media platforms often collect and use personal data for targeted advertising purposes. While this can be beneficial for both users and advertisers, it raises concerns about the potential for abuse. For example, if a user's data is used to target them with political ads, they may be more susceptible to manipulation or misinformation. In some cases, this could even undermine the integrity of democratic processes.

On the other hand, opponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media users should be responsible for managing their own privacy settings and sharing only the information they are comfortable with. They argue that users have the freedom to choose which platforms they use and how much personal information they share, and that it is not the responsibility of social media companies to police this behavior.

Additionally, some argue that stronger privacy protections could stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of social media. For example, if social media companies are required to obtain explicit consent before collecting or using personal data, they may be less able to develop new features or services that rely on this data.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that stronger privacy protections are needed on social media platforms. The potential risks of data breaches and misuse are simply too great to ignore, and social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. At the same time, users should also take steps to manage their own privacy settings and be mindful of the information they share online. By working together, we can create a safer and more secure social media environment for all.",1,75
"Driverless Cars is a great idea, these cars would make a huge change in the world because these cars would be really helpful, but there are some advantages and disavenges of the use of these cars, one advantages is that can drive by themselves, but a disadvantage is that if the sensors don't work what would happen?.

Driverless cars would be really helpful for people and mostly for people that travel a lot they fall sleep, these cars would help them by taking control and so no one get hurt. Driverless cars have sensors that help to create a 3-D model of the car's surroundings, so this would help the car to see if there is any danger and if the is the car will notify the driver to take over and take another options. Cars like these are a great idea, it will allow the drivers to take a rest when they are tired.

Cars like driverless cars are not perfect, and they are not 100 percent safe, these cars can be really expensive too and not everyone would buy them. About safety the sensors that these cars use what if they don't work? What would it happen? If the sensors don't work the cars will not alert the driver if there is any danger and this will end up in an accident and would not be good for the manufacturer and the owner, these were some reasons why the manufacturers want to put cameras in the cars, so the car can see the driver and know whether the driver can drive or cannot drive.

Some manufacturers like GM they have developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Other car that tells the driver when they should take over the car is the Google car. Cameras in cars can help a lot because while the driver is watching the road the car is watching the driver. Some manufacturers are considering bringing entertainment for these cars and information system that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver needs to take over. This new technology in cars is perfect, but how much these will cost? No one knows yet. I strongly agree with to develop of the driverless cars because this will really help people and will help to reduce the cars accidents.

Driverless cars are definitely are great this new technology will allow the driver to take a rest and then take over any time. The sensors that the cars have help to avoid any danger. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have these new cars drive themselves by 2020, the cars they try to make will be the best option to have fewer cars accidents in the future.",0,76
"I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I think that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today.

There are a few reasons why I think this will be the case. First, the population is growing. More people means more cars. Second, the population is getting older. Older people are more likely to own a car than younger people. Third, cars are becoming more affordable. More people can afford to buy a car than ever before.

There are a few reasons why cars might become less popular in twenty years. First, the cost of owning a car is rising. Cars are becoming more expensive to maintain and to fuel. Second, alternative modes of transportation are becoming more popular. People are choosing to bike or walk more often than they used to. Third, self-driving cars are becoming more common. This could lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road.

Despite these potential factors, I think that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today. The population is growing, the population is getting older, and cars are becoming more affordable. These factors will outweigh the potential factors that could lead to a decrease in the number of cars on the road.

"The reason why there is the technology of people to know how to understand on how the reason the pot rites are in this world today. By showing on how the way the pictures in the text is showing how she is smiling. I think we should leave her face the way is originally on the way it is from the way the marginal person painted it. It is being very respectful on how the painting is being displayed in different muse mes here around the world.

The reason why I think this is that let's say that we painted something and someone goes in and paint it completely different. Then what you made it to be in the first place. So I feel like we all should leave things they were when they were created. The respect we give we get in return from the same reason y we gave it to others because the more you give, the more it looks good on you in the long run. So just remember that the next time you see someone changing someone else's painting or others works. They work so hard on because why would they work so hard on something that someone else is just going to go back in and change it.  ",0,78
" Summer vacations are an essential break for students to recharge and refresh their minds. It is an opportunity for them to spend time with their families, take a break from school, and engage in activities that they enjoy. However, some educators believe that summer vacations should be shorter, and students should be required to attend school year-round. In this essay, I will argue that summer vacations should be longer and that reducing them would have negative consequences for students' mental and emotional well-being.

First, summer vacations provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation. School can be stressful, and students often feel overwhelmed with work and responsibilities. Summer vacation offers a chance for students to unwind and recharge. This is especially important for students who have experienced bullying, stress, or academic failure. They need time to process their emotions and reflect on their experiences. Reducing summer vacation would mean that these students would not have the opportunity to take a break and focus on their mental health.

Second, summer vacations allow students to pursue their interests and hobbies. Many students use their summer vacation to take up new activities or pursue their passions. This can be an excellent opportunity for them to learn new skills and develop their talents. Reducing summer vacation would mean that students would not have the time to engage in these activities, and their personal growth would be stunted.

Third, summer vacations provide students with the opportunity to work and earn money. Many students use their summer vacation to get a job and save money for college or other expenses. This can be an excellent way for them to gain work experience and develop valuable skills. Reducing summer vacation would mean that students would not have the opportunity to work and earn money, and their financial stability would be compromised.

In conclusion, summer vacations are an essential part of the educational experience. They provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation, allow them to pursue their interests and hobbies, and provide them with the opportunity to work and earn money. Reducing summer vacation would have negative consequences for students' mental and emotional well-being, personal growth, and financial stability. Therefore, it is crucial that educators and policymakers recognize the importance of summer vacations and work to ensure that they are long enough to provide students with the benefits they need.",1,79
"Hey, so I'm going to write this essay about how having a good attitude can be super important, even when things are tough. Like, I know it can be easy to get down when stuff isn't going your way, but if you have a good attitude, it can make all the difference.

First, having a good attitude can make you successful. Like, if you're always positive and stuff, people are gonna want to be around you and stuff. They're gonna wanna work with you and stuff, 'cause you're going to be fun to be around. And that means you're going to have more opportunities, 'cause people are gonna want to help you out and stuff. And that's how you get ahead in life, right?

And it's not just about getting ahead, it's also about being strong. When things are tough, if you have a good attitude, you can handle it. You can be like, ""Yeah, this is tough, but I can do it."" And then you can do it, 'cause you believe in yourself. And that's when you're at your strongest, when you're like, ""I can handle anything.""

And it's not just about you, it's also about how you can help others. When you have a good attitude, you're more likely to help people out, 'cause you're in a good mood and stuff. And that's when you can make a difference in people's lives, 'cause you're being nice and stuff. And that's when you can make a real impact, 'cause you're not just thinking about yourself, you're thinking about others too.

And let me tell you, it's not just like, ""Oh, good attitudes are nice and stuff."" It's like, they can lead to amazing experiences. Like, if you have a good attitude, you're more likely to take risks and stuff, and that's when you can have the most fun. And that's when you can have the best experiences, 'cause you're not just stuck in one place, you're out there doing stuff and living life.

"This Facial Action Coding System could be good in a couple ways but it's unnecessary. Computers might know what your emotions and help in a couple ways to know if you're confused about something or do not like something you see on the internet. Just because you look at someone's face, it doesn't mean that they feel some type of way. Someone could be smiling or laughing, but that doesn't mean that they are truly happy. It's the same thing by having a serious face.

A face expression doesn't always show someone's emotions. Other people do not care about other people's emotions. It's better to notice things with your own eyes than a computer or machine to tell you how somebody is ""feeling"". The article says you can tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. That's true because you know that person very well.

People do want to hide their emotions for their own specific reason. We all have that moment when we would want to keep our feelings to ourselves. We wouldn't like for systems to know our emotions.",0,81
" I believe that having a positive attitude is essential in life. In my experience, maintaining a positive outlook has helped me achieve many of my goals and enjoy the good things that come my way. I have learned to always look on the bright side, even in difficult situations, and to be grateful for what I have. This has helped me to attract positive energy and opportunities into my life.

One of the benefits of having a positive attitude is that it allows you to give advice and support to others. When you approach people with a positive attitude, they are more likely to respond in kind. This can lead to a cycle of positivity and support, where both parties feel uplifted and motivated.

It's also important to remember that life is unpredictable, and that sometimes things may not go as planned. However, instead of dwelling on the negatives, it's important to focus on the present moment and make the most of the situation. This can help you find new opportunities and learn from your mistakes.

Overall, I believe that having a positive attitude is key to living a fulfilling and successful life. By focusing on the positive, you can attract good things into your life and make a difference in the lives of those around you.",1,82
"On that faithful June afternoon, the school bell rings for its last time in three months. Students rush out of their classes and greet the summer with open arms. Of course, once school opens up again in August, many of these students have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Many schools assign projects to complete over the summer in order to keep their students' minds sharp; however, there are debates whether the teachers or the students should design the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed, so students can properly develop the tools that will help them succeed the following year.

Teacher-designed projects will set the rigor of the class, so students know what to expect. It is most likely that the teacher that assigns the project will be the one instructing the class. If teachers design the project, they can set the guidelines for the year in their summer assignment, so students are not caught off guard. This is especially important for higher level classes such as honors or AP; it is best that all students are aware of the class' expectations, so they can develop their skills as necessary for the course. Students can also decide whether the class is right for them, whether it be because it is too rigorous, not rigorous enough, or simply because the subject does not interest them. This way there is less fuss during the school year as students try to switch their classes.

Teacher-designed projects can allow the students to grow their academic independence. During the school year, teachers are readily available in case students need to answer questions. However, during the summer it is not as easy as raising one's hand in class; students are almost entirely on their own. They will have to develop the skills needed to solve a novel problem independently. This ability is referred to by psychologists as fluid intelligence. One's fluid intelligence decreases with age, so it is important for students to strengthen it while they are young. Students may also find useful academic tools that help them to understand the material of the class. One of the more well known of these tools is Khan Academy. Students often go to these websites to understand what they could not in class. Finding these tools during the summer will prove useful, as they can still be used during the school year.

While student input is important, the teachers are more likely to give projects that are closer in rigor and content to the actual class. Teachers have been trained both in teaching that the subject that they teach, so they likely know the best way to prepare students for what lies ahead. This is why summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students.",0,83
"Community service is a hot topic in schools these days, with many schools requiring students to complete a certain number of hours of community service in order to graduate. While some people think this is a great way to teach students the value of giving back to their community, others argue that it takes away from the time students could be spending on academics. In this essay, I'll explore the pros and cons of requiring community service, and suggest a potential solution that takes into account the needs of all parties involved.

One of the biggest pros of requiring community service is that it teaches students important life skills, such as empathy, teamwork, and problem-solving. By giving students the opportunity to help others, they learn how to work together towards a common goal and develop a sense of social responsibility. Additionally, community service can help students develop a sense of purpose and direction, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling with academic or personal issues.

On the other hand, some people argue that requiring community service takes away from the time students could be spending on academics. This is a valid concern, as students who are required to complete many community service hours may fall behind in their schoolwork or struggle to keep up with their academic responsibilities. Additionally, some students may not have access to community service opportunities, either because they live in areas with limited options or because they have other commitments such as work or family responsibilities.

So, what's the solution? One potential solution is to require community service, but to also provide students with flexible options that can be tailored to their individual needs. For example, students could be allowed to choose from a variety of community service projects, such as volunteering at a local animal shelter, participating in a beach cleanup, or helping out at a food bank. This way, students can choose an activity that they are passionate about and that fits their schedule and interests.

Another potential solution is to provide students with academic credit for their community service hours. This way, students can earn credits towards their graduation requirements while still fulfilling their community service obligations. This could be especially helpful for students who are struggling to balance their academic and community service responsibilities.

In conclusion, while there are both pros and cons to requiring community service, a potential solution is to provide students with flexible",1,84
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does not do a good job of supporting their idea. The author believes that, while Venus is dangerous it is worthy of spending time and money to explore this planet. The author mentions the similarities between earth and Venus, makes exploring this planet so fascinating. The author later goes on to explain how NASA would travel and explore Venus, and what tools they would use to explore Venus. How NASA would travel to Venus is reevaluate to if Venus is worth exploring. Because, the author spends a majority of their time telling us how, NASA would learn more about Venus. Is not needed to prove and explain why exploring Venus is pessary.

The author spends three of their six body paragraphs explaining how NASA would explore the planet of Venus. In paragraph 6 they explain that sending an orbiting ship around the planet will provide limited insight of the ground below, and the only way to gain more knowledge is to be able to collect rock and gas samples. The author never states what we could possible learn from the rock samples, or even celebrates on the idea of collecting a variety of samples from the planet. They later spend paragraph 7 explaining the history of computers and how much computes have progressed since 1800. They even explain the mechanics of computers during the World War II for example, ""these devices make calculations by using gear and levers and do not require electronics at all."" The mechanics of computers has nothing to do with the idea that we should be exploring NASA. The information provided in paragraph 5 through 7, such as the history and mechanics of computers. The little information given on how a rock sample will help us learn about Venus, or that NASA isn't able to gain enough information from sending a hovering ship about the planet, do not help or support the authors claim that Venus is worthy of exploring despite the dangers.

To summarize, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

Does not do a good job of explaining why Venus is worthy is studying and exploring, despite the dangers. The author spends too much time explaining computers, the history and the mechanics of them, and what we could learn about Venus through computers. They also use their time to tell their readers that sending an orbiting ship around plant won't provide us with enough information, and to explain how they would explore Venus and the tools they would use.

Hey there, it's me, [Your Name], an average 8th grader, here to share my thoughts on why swimming is an enjoyable activity. I know, I know, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but trust me, it should be! 😊

First off, let's talk about the benefits of swimming. It's a full-body workout that can improve your cardiovascular health, increase your strength and flexibility, and even help with weight management. Plus, it's low-impact, so it's easier on your joints compared to other high-impact sports. And, did you know that swimming can help prevent injuries? It's like a natural injury prevention program! 🤯

Now, I know some people might think swimming is boring, but let me tell you, it's not! 😅 I mean, have you ever tried swimming laps in a pool? It's like a whole different world! You can swim with friends, play games like ""Marco Polo,"" or even just splash around and have fun. And, if you're lucky, you might even see some cool sea creatures like fisfishes dolphins! 🐟🐬

Personally, I love swimming because it's a great way to relax and unwind. When I'm in the water, all my worries just melt away, and I feel so free! Plus, it's a great way to get some exercise without even realizing it. I mean, have you ever tried swimming a mile? It's exhausting, but in a good way! 😅

Swimming has also had a big impact on my life. Growing up, my family didn't have a pool, so I never thought I'd be able to learn how to swim. But, my parents signed me up for swim lessons, and it was one of the best decisions they ever made! 🌟 Not only did I learn how to swim, but I also made some amazing friends and developed a newfound appreciation for the water.

"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you today to discuss a matter of great importance to me and my fellow students. I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. Furthermore, I understand that there are rules and regulations in place to ensure that students are maintaining their academic performance, but I believe that there is more to life than just academics.

As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of trying hard and making good decisions. It is not enough to just get good grades, but it is also important to be involved in extracurricular activities. Participating in sports and activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. It can also help students build self-esteem and confidence.

I understand that some students may struggle to balance academics with sports and activities, but I believe that it is important for them to try. It is not enough to just give up and focus solely on academics. Students should be encouraged to find a balance and make good decisions about how they spend their time.

I also believe that allowing students to participate in sports and activities can help them achieve their goals. Whether it is getting into college or pursuing a career, participation in extracurricular activities can help students stand out and demonstrate their dedication and commitment.

In conclusion, I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. It is important for students to try hard and make good decisions, and participation in extracurricular activities can help them develop important skills and achieve their goals. I urge you to consider this matter and make a decision that will benefit all students.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,87
"In my perspective, I believe that when viewing someone's facial, or human emotions it should be visual. I do not agree with the form of technology. By viewing someone's emotions it forms a sense of character which is good with person to person with associating with one another. According to the article, it talks about how the process with technology starts at a 3-D computer of the face which is then known to have 44 muscles which then shows the movement of the face to detect the human emotions. The article continually explains that the facial expressions are what are known to detect the emotions through technology. This ll today is showing you what all a computer can actually do. According to the article they agree on using the technology from what the computer can actually do. In my perspective I think my opinion is the opposite. Your emotions should be detected by another human’s point of view, not by technology. ",0,88
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this technology may help teachers understand how their lessons are engaging students on an emotional level. If a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a lesson, FACS could provide valuable feedback to improve instruction methods. It could also assist teachers in identifying students who are struggling emotionally but may not express it otherwise. This type of technology could help teachers provide better emotional support to students. 

However, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions with FACS also raises privacy and behavioral issues. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being surveilled and analyzed in real time. This could increase anxiety and discourage natural emotional responses during class. Students should feel free to focus internally on learning without worrying about expressions being screened. Additionally, identifying emotions through facial expressions alone may not provide full context and could result in misinterpretations. A student's expression may not accurately reflect how they internally feel about a lesson.

Overall, while FACS technology aims to give teachers useful insights, its continuous use in the classroom to monitor students risks invading privacy and altering natural classroom behaviors. Teachers could benefit from occasional voluntary emotional check-ins with students, but constant facial monitoring goes too far. More traditional methods of teacher-student communication are generally preferable to validate a student's emotional experience in school. If used sparingly and with consent, this technology may offer value, but broader application could do more harm than good.",1,89
"From man's very first trip out of Earth's atmosphere to the iconic moon landing, people from all across the world have always wondered what lies in the unknown solar system that surrounds them. Despite the danger and the failures that plagued these early scientists, they still strived to explore space and the planets within it. In writing ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author is able to very convincingly explain the benefits of exploring Venus, despite the dangerous challenges this endeavor may present.

The article starts off by describing Venus and providing background for the reader, allowing the writer to make a stronger and more understandable claim later on in the work. Venus, as described in the article, is often the closest planet to Earth, depending on the time, and is repeating called ""Earth's 'twin'"" because of its similarity in size and density to Earth. The author then goes one to describe the multiple missions already taken to Venus, which have all failed in the end.

While the author does state reasons why a mission to Venus could be treacherous, he or she is able to negate these downfalls by listing all the possible benefits of exploring this inhospitable planet. Venus is considered by scientists to be a dangerous planet to explore for many reasons included in the writing.

For one, its temperature far exceeds in heat any which the Earth has reached by hundreds of degrees. The atmosphere of Venus also contains a corrosive acid which would be a great obstacle to any vehicle attempting to pass through. The author then goes on to give multiple other reasons in support of danger, but is finally able to oppose these concerns by listing all the reasons why man kind should explore Venus. For one, Venus is the planet that is most near Earth and therefore will take the shortest time to journey towards. Space travel, the author includes, is very time-consuming and not to be taken on lightly. In addition, scientists believe Venus may have once been exceedingly similar to today's Earth. By giving this information, the author is able to infer that information gained by a trip to Venus could be very much crucial to ensuring the survival of the planet home to a large amount of life. The writing claims, after all of these reasons, that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"" despite the hardships explorers would face.

In further support of this claim, the author explains the multiple ways that scientists are testing in order to make a trip to Venus possible. The article shows that already, multiple ideas have been proven to work.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is able to very successfully make the claim that Venus is worth exploring through negation of the dangers of such a trip by providing multiple benefits of a visit and the ways in which scientists have already found to make the trip possible. Exploration is exceedingly valuable to maintaining and improving life on Earth and, as written by the author, ""should not be limited by dangers and doubts.""  ",0,90
"Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.

Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.

Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on whom to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.

Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."" Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

"Nowadays, it is widely accepted that having a graduate degree is a prerequisite for career advancement in many institutions. While a degree certificate may reflect one's academic achievements, it does not necessarily reflect all the abilities essential for a successful career. I agree with this statement for the following reasons.

First, having a graduate degree does not guarantee that one has the necessary skills for a successful career. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work in a customer service position because he or she lacks the necessary customer service skills.

Second, a degree certificate does not reflect all the abilities that are essential for a successful career. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may be able to work in a customer service position if he or she has the necessary skills, such as communication and problem-solving skills.

Third, a degree certificate may not be relevant to the job that one is applying for. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work as a doctor if he or she does not have the necessary medical knowledge.

Fourth, a degree certificate may not be current. For example, a person with a degree in engineering may not be able to work as a doctor if the degree is not up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge.

In conclusion, I believe that a degree certificate does not reflect all the abilities that are essential for a successful career.

"How do you feel about students having to do an extracurricular activity? I believe that it would help students be better people. These activities will keep them out of trouble. Extra activities with new people will help improve the social skills of students. Activities such as sports will keep them healthy and active. Do you not want students to be better people for others, and themselves?

First, Students that have an extracurricular activity will stay out of trouble. When a student is doing something good for them self, and they enjoy it, they will not be getting into much trouble. If students are playing a sport they will be motivated to stay healthy and stay away from drugs. Most extracurricular activities require good behavior. Therefore, if a student gets attached to an activity they will do their best to stay out of trouble.

Secondly, Students that less social skills can meet new people. Those students can create strong, long-lasting bonds. Extracurricular activities can give students the friends they need that make them happy. Some friendships are even like family, and those types of bonds are important. We need students to have strong bonds and stronger social skills.

Finally, These activities can keep the students healthy, and active. Sports will have students always moving and keep them in shape. Some activities will teach you about nutrients and how to support your body. Activities like these will keep you healthy and make you feel better about yourself. If everyone participates in these activities than everyone will be happy, healthy, and active.

In conclusion, I believe that extracurricular activities will make students a bigger part of society. These activities will get students to behave. The students will be healthy. The activities will give the students better social skills. That is why I believe that extracurricular activities will make students be better people.",0,93
"Control your life or let it control you. Since technology has improved significantly since the past decades, In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" humans are able to create vehicles that drive themselves. They have their pros and cons but the cons out-shape the pros. Driverless cars are lethal, illegal, and time-consuming to manufacture.

The first reason on why driveless cars are lethal is that they are not tested fully and can injure the driver very severely if not handled right. This is evident in paragraph 9 where the author states, ""manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe."" This is a perfect example of how the driveless cars are still unstable and should be tested. Overall, companies still need to improve on some aspects on the driveless car to have it be a safe to use.

The second reason is that the utilization of driveless cars on testing is illegal. Evidence to support this claim is that the author states in paragraph 9, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This makes the invention difficult to find its shortcomings and hard to sell. More evidence is found that a lot of people can get in trouble due to this technology failing, which is found in paragraph nine again, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This can both harm them because of the injury and the company's reputation. Overall, driveless cars are suited to test because of the law.

Finally, the last reasoning on while driveless cars are suited for the market is because of time. It takes a long time to produce; this is stated by the author in paragraph 5, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" It takes the company TEN YEARS to only create one component of the device. Overall, driveless cars take a long time to produce.

Driverless cars can be conducive and negative to the consumer, but the drawbacks out match the pros with It's dangerous to control, legalization, and time-consuming process to manufacture. The technology is not ready yet for this device to hit shelves in markets and is best to wait when there is more money involved for this project.",0,94
"Phones & Driving

Should people be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle? Different generations would agree and disagree. Older generation would say ""No, drivers should not be able to use a phone while driving."" While newer generation would say ""Yes, drivers should be able to use a phone while driving."" I believe that drivers should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle.

Statistics state that 26% of all crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use. 10% of those crashes are teen drivers of the age 15 to 19. Teens are more likely to text and drive because their world is revolved around social media. Because teenagers are young and naïve we believe that we are more capable of multitasking but, history has shown otherwise.

Some people think they are invincible and can't be killed. So, they think can text and drive and not get hurt or face the consequences. People as they get older think they can get away with more stuff like texting and driving, but life hits them with a wake-up call.

In conclusion, do you think drivers should be able to use their cell phone while driving? People need to keep their eyes on the road and on nothing else. They need to stay focused to their surroundings. Texting and driving kills, so be careful on the roads.  ",0,95
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that we should keep the current Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States, rather than change to a popular vote system. There are several important reasons why maintaining the Electoral College is preferable.

First, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. Under a popular vote, candidates would likely focus all their efforts on population centers along the coasts and largely ignore the rest of the country. This could worsen regional divisions. The Electoral College system requires candidates to appeal to a wider range of constituencies across many states. 

However, some argue that the popular vote more directly reflects the will of the people. While it is true that the candidate who wins the national popular vote may sometimes lose the Electoral College, this system has still maintained stability for our country over many elections. It also encourages two viable national political parties and prevents third party candidates from winning with just a small percentage of votes nationwide. Changing to a strictly popular system could undermine this stability.

Additionally, smaller states argue that they would have less influence under a popular vote system. The current framework gives even the least populous states a minimum of three electoral votes, ensuring that candidates must consider their interests too. A national popular vote might diminish the role of smaller, less populated states. 

In conclusion, while the Electoral College system is imperfect, it has served the country reasonably well overall and maintains several advantages over a simple national popular vote. For these reasons, I believe we should retain the current Electoral College framework for now. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my argument. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

"Part of our current education system provides free childcare to parents in addition to helping longer students developed socially. This is why brick and order schools will always be a necessity for elementary schoolers, but students outside that age range should have the opportunity to demonstrate their responsibility in order to receive the privilege of being taught at home rather than at school because of social distractions, and the general time sink that is school.

All you ever hear about public schools today is bullying, exclusion, and drama that is pointless and distracts students from their academics, the solution is right in front of us, online school. Online school would be superior to traditional brick and Porter school because students would have minimum opportunities to interact with one and other during class which would make classroom control easier for the teacher. In addition to students having minimum opportunities to speak in class, everything that was said during the class could be monitored by the teacher or by an automated program designed to detect any buzzwords, unkind or curse words. The automation could also keep count of the number of times students cursed or said rude things to each other and report these infractions to the teacher. While this process might sound invasive, it isn't anything that teachers don't try to facilitate with physically, now they can do it technologically.

While the in class conversations can defiantly be monitored, there is also out of class social media and texting that could be distracting during online class time, and with no physical adult in the room telling students to put away the phone how could we be sure that we aren't just trading one evil for another? While there are numerous distractions at home that could cause students grades to dip, the solution to this potential problem is that online school would need to be a privilege and not a right. Class time would need to be monitored.

Another benefit of monitored online school is that with fewer distractions the class could move faster which would allow extra time for students to pursue recreational activities, and academic interests-this system would allow students to separate their work time from their play time in a way that is just not possible today. This system of having extra time to dedicate to passions would also be beneficial in incentivizing students to pay attention during class. This system also promotes better friendships by giving students time to pursue interests outside of school-- providing an outlet to meet like-minded people.

While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that many students view school as a whole. Instead of being forced to sit in a building all day with other kids, we could be at home leaning on our own time with pre-recorded videos. With online schooling students get the opportunity to control their own education, and they are also incentivized to preform well, not because they are competing for spots at some prestigious collage, but because they want their own free time.  ",0,97
"Are electoral college better than other colleges. Yes i believe that an electoral college is better than other collages because they help pick the Braden and the vice president based on votes, the Electoral collage is consists on 538 votes which majority of 270 electors is required to elect the president.

An electoral college is a collage that helps pick candidates that are running for president in are state. The candidates are chosen by the political party. The election is held every 4 years on teethe first Tuesday of November. My second reason electoral collages help are state out are they help pick they right states to vote.

An electoral collage tells there president where to go and give there speeches. Presidebts seems are very important, the speeches give them vote two keep them president in charge. Some on the big voting states are Texas, california, and Florida, so in conclusion you should go two an electoral collage because they help are states out by pick the right president and keeping him.",0,98
"A growing trend in day to day life that is occurring around the world is ""carefree"" day. Carefree day has spread in cities and towns around Europe and the Americas to separate suburban life from automobile use. This is beneficial in many ways to the growth, forward movement, and health of towns. So far Europe, Asia, and the Americas have given up car usage for a day, and even given up car usage entirely.

Different cities practice carefree day differently. In Paris, the near record pollution was at its height. The city participated in carefree day by enforcing a partial driving ban and making people with even numbered license plates leave their cars at home. The following day, the odd numbered license plates were confined to home. Any person who didn't follow guidelines and conduct was fined. The congestion of smog in the capital of France decreased by sixty percent. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, like Brussels and London. By participating in the carefree day, Paris was able to contribute to cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and temporarily fix a few environmental concerns in Paris. Even though they had some effective results, Paris wasn't the only city that participated in the trend.

Across the Atlantic Ocean in Bogotá, the program allowed Colombians of Bogotá to hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. The carefree day left the normally busy, full and loud streets devoid of traffic jams. The goal to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog was enforced by minor fines. Despite the fact that rain showers were common, it did not stop the people from participating. The people of the town viewed it as a day of taking away stress and lowering AR pollution. The day without cars has been part of an improvement campaign since the mid 1990s, and has since been practiced at least one day out of the year. Authorities from countries all around the world have gone to the event and were impressed and some were inspired. Even other cities that are in Colombia have joined the event like Cali and Valledupar.

Back in Europe, the city of Vauban, Germany, has taken place in a permanent car band. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are nearly forbidden in the experimental and new district of Freiburg. While car ownership is allowed, there are only two places to park. People that live there generally like the way of life in Vauban. Many of them sold their cars just to move there in the first place. The overall feeling of living in a city free of cars seems to lift stress of the people that live there. Therefore, the people are happier and more productive. Vauban is known as the most advanced experiment in attempts to make suburbs more compact and have a minute number of vehicles. Supermarkets and stores as a result have been moved to a closer distance so that they could be walking distance away. Our development as people over the past century had been based on the car, and Vauban goes completely against the idea that progress is based off of the car.

Even in America, Obama is ambitious to change the amount of the United States pollution. While although cities have yet to participate in carefree day, Citizens are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses across America each year. This gives researchers the idea that America is passed the peak driving level. American life has been integrated with cars from the time that the Model T was born. As the amount of jobs decrease, people just can not afford to buy cars. People in America have lost the general idea of a car and it's uses. Young adults in college have learned to use other ways of transport like carpooling with a friend, public transportation, or walking to the destination. The amount of people has dropped more than twenty percent and still continues to drop. This incipient stage of American life has implied the idea of alternatives to multiple motored vehicles.

Cities all around the world are deciding to practice their own car free day and are decreasing the use of cars altogether. The practice of carefree day has caused parks to initiate, sidewalks to be prepared repaired, cut traffic, give joy to the people, and overall diminish air pollution.",0,99
"I recently decided to take a closer look at the different subjects taught in elementary schools across the country. To better understand how the learning process takes place, I talked with current teachers about their teaching styles and techniques for engaging students. I also researched different ways to make lessons interesting and engaging. I asked family members and friends about their own elementary school experiences – what they enjoyed and found difficult.

Furthermore, I wanted to observe students in an elementary school to see how they interact and learn, so visited an elementary school in my area. It was fascinating to observe how the children absorbed the knowledge and interacted with each other. Afterwards, I learned about different activities and games which could be exciting for elementary school students. With this in mind, I prepared a lesson plan for teaching an elementary school subject.",1,100
"Hello, my name is Luke Merger, and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. The Seagoing Cowboys took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped across the ocean. My friend, Don, and I signed up. I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you could save a life.

The Seagoing Cowboys help people in need, especially after World War ll, it feels so nice to help people in need, if you sign up you could feel it, too. Since we ship animals and take care of them around the world, we provide people with good livestock, that maybe, could save a life! And, if you're bored, the animals keep you busy. Also, there is some incredible sightseeing around the world.

Another reason you would want to sign for the Seagoing Cowboys program is you could see some truly, incredible things! Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China! I saw some beautiful things like, the Acropolis in Greece, taking the gondola ride in Italy, that has streets of water, I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I loved the Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. That may be beautiful, but if you still aren't convinced, the danger that it puts in your life makes your heart pump!

My third reason, is the danger and heart-skipping-a-beat experiences that this program gives you! If you're bored with your life, think about the Seagoing Cowboys program. The reason I say this, is one rainy night, after I made my hourly report to my captain, I suddenly slid down a slippery ladder on my back. I would've fallen off, if it wasn't for a strip of metal that caught me! I would have been in the deep water of the Atlantic by now. Furthermore, I felt happy to be alive, and I will never forget that moment.

My last reason is that I had so much fun, and it was a truly amazing, never-forgetting experience. On return trips we played games in the hold where the animals were. We played baseball, volleyball, and other games like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and more, that got us ready for our next adventure. This program gave me a better-than-amazing experience, and I would love to share it with you!

Now, I should conclude my thoughts. You should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys, so you could help people in need, see amazing things, such as the Acropolis in Greece, so you can have a dangerous but amazing life, and so you can have fun and have a never forgetting experience. Sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys, now!

Thanks,

"Dear Principal,

I think all kids should be required to do community service because even do us as kids thinks community is waste of time. It is not a waste of time because community service is something you take time out of your life or day and go help people, help the earth.

Imagine if you don't help the earth probably sometime in the future, you won't be in a world full of sunshine and happiness, but you will be living in a world of darkness and despair. I doubt anyone can live in a world like that. There probably won't be no sports, no shopping for good clothes and even some death, instead there will be flattened basketballs and footballs because since no one helped the earth all of our resources would be gone and your parents will lose their jobs, so the president can try to make the world good again, raise taxes so less stuff for us kids. If you go to the store there won't be awesome clothes like polo instead there will be some horrible stuff like messed up clothes that hobos be wearing, and I know for a fact no kid want to be wearing them definitely if you're a fashion diva. See a world like this isn't the world us kids want.

If you do community service and help people then you might not get rewards the same day, but you will get something good. Helping the less fortune or the deaf and blind. Even if the deaf couldn't hear what you said, they can see what you said. What if one day our world is being run by a deaf man or woman, and the reason their all the way at the top is because of you. You help them to read, and they grow up to become president just because you took time out of your life to help them. Overall I think doing community service might be a drag, but it's the right thing, and you help one or even more lives.

"Many people have been debating on the topic of which skill of English is more important for Chinese learners. In this article, I would like to share my opinion on this topic.

I believe that speaking and reading are the most important skills for a Chinese learner. However, it is important to remember that there are many other skills that are also important, such as listening, speaking, writing, and so on. It is very difficult to learn all of these skills at the same time, so it's better to focus on one skill at a time. For example, if you want to be able to read and write Chinese, you should first learn to speak and read Chinese. If you don't have the time to do both, then you can focus more on reading and less on speaking. The same goes for listening. You can learn Chinese by listening to a lot of different kinds of Chinese music, but you won't be fluent in Chinese unless you also learn how to listen to Chinese radio, TV, movies, etc. This is a very important skill to have, because it will help you to understand Chinese culture better and will make it easier to communicate with other Chinese people. So, in the end, learning English and speaking Chinese are not mutually exclusive. They are two different skills, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

"Math is an essential part of our daily lives, and it has been an important part of mine too. I have always found math to be a fascinating subject, and I believe it has played a significant role in shaping my life.

One of the most obvious ways' math is used in daily life is in financial transactions. For example, when I buy groceries at the store, I need to calculate the total cost of my items, including taxes and any discounts I might be eligible for. Math is also used in budgeting and saving money, which are essential skills for financial stability.

Another place where math is used in daily life is in technology. Math is the foundation of many technological devices, including computers, smartphones, and cars. Without math, these devices would not be able to perform the complex calculations required to function properly. For example, when I use my GPS to navigate to a new location, the device uses math to calculate the shortest route based on current traffic conditions.

Math is also used in science and engineering. For example, when scientists design new drugs or medical devices, they use math to calculate the properties of the substance and ensure it is safe for use. Engineers use math to design bridges, buildings, and other structures, ensuring they are safe and efficient.

In terms of preparing for success in the future, math is a crucial subject. Many careers require a strong foundation in math, including engineering, science, and finance. Additionally, math skills are transferable to many other subjects, such as physics, computer science, and even art.

However, math is not always perceived positively by others. Some people view math as a difficult and tedious subject, while others see it as a necessary evil. However, I believe that math is an essential skill that everyone should have, regardless of their interests or career goals.

In conclusion, math is an essential part of our daily lives, and it has been an important part of mine too. Math is used in financial transactions, technology, science, and engineering, and it is essential for success in many careers. While math may not be perceived positively by everyone, I believe it is an essential skill that everyone should have.",1,104
"Imagine you are about to head into summer break and your teacher assigns a summer project that you aren't interested in. Some students believe they should be able to design their own project. Although some say teachers should be responsible for designing summer projects. Actually students should be able to design summer projects to fit what they do during summer.

Those who believe teachers should design summer projects have their reasons. They believe teachers should design summer projects because it will keep students occupied over the summer. Teachers would be able to control what their students do and hopefully keep their minds fresh for the following year. Teachers don't think students should be able to control what their project is on because it could lead them off track or students wouldn't take it serious.

Actually, students should be able to design their own summer projects because they would be able to base it off their summer vacation. Students would be more engaged in what they are doing because they would be able to do what they are interested in but still be learning new material or review on what they had learned in the past year. This would keep students thinking about their project and make it fun for them to do.

Another reason is students would be able to base their project on what they do for the summer. For example if a student was going to the Cayman Islands they could make their project fit in to what he or she does. This would stop students from stressing and pushing away from doing the project. The project wouldn't entirely be made up by the students. There would still be limitations like the material you would choose to do your project on, so students will still have to put in effort. This helps Students have fun on vacation while getting a head start for the next year.

In conclusion students should be able to design their own projects, so they would still be able to enjoy their vacation without stressing over school. Students would be able to show creativity and positive learning skills for the upcoming year. I think all summer projects should be student designed to encourage students to learn to be creative and happy with what they are doing.",0,105
"For a long time now we have been fighting against global warming and solution. Some people why we can't just end the fight quickly. And the reason is simply because we still rely so much on cars. All people need to find so type of way to stop using cars as much. There are some places that are already starting to limit uses. Like in Vauban, Germany who has a ban on cars, Paris, France who can use certain cars on certain days, and Bogota, Colombia.

One way people could limit their use of cars is if they did something like what Vauban, Germany did. Build cities that had no driveways and no parking lots. That way people had to buy parking large spots that cost a lot of money. According to source one passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe. Many will think this is not a lot but think about how much solution there is, then find out how twelve percent is it will be a lot. But when these types of cities are made there will be a reduced in the emissions because little if any cars we be driven here. In source one Hadron Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This shows that without cars in people life it removes a tremendous amount of stress. People don't have to worry about spending money on gas, or they don't have to worry about paying large amounts of money for their car to be fit. When there is not so much money at stake you tend to be a little less tense. Obviously creating a city were you have to buy a parking garage spot to hold your car would be a great idea because it would reduce the amount of solution being released, and it would make the people living in the city less stressed.

Another ways people could limit the use of cars is if they do something like Paris, France does. They placed a ban on cars with odd numbered license plates on Mondays, And placed a ban on cars with even numbered license plates on Tuesdays. They did this because they were having record-breaking amounts of solution being released. Furthermore, they were releasing more solution than Beijing, China who is the leading city in solution. But according to article two Paris found a sixty percent decrease in solution in just five days of this even odd ban. This means they lost more than half of the cities solution by limiting the cars on Monday to only even license and limiting the cars to only odd license on Tuesday. Clara this is a very effective method of reducing the amount of cars being used.

A third way cars could be used less is if you have no car days like Bogota, Colombia has. In article three Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air solution."" He is saying that cars a cause for solution and doing this day is a good way of lowering solution rates. This source also stated that other cities in Columbia like Cali and Valledupar are joining in this event. It is also said that other country leaders go to Colombia to watch this event. Afterwards they say the event is awesome. This means that not only is the event spreading across Colombia, but it could possibly spread to other countries as well. Without a doubt this is another effective way to limit the use of cars.

It is clear that cars are a problem. But many people use them anyway, but what they don't think about is how much they are contributing to solution. Some ways to limit car usage are created cities where you have to pay for a place to store you car, have and even odd license day, and have no car days. So now the choice is yours will you continue driving all the time, or will you limit the amount you drive?  ",0,106
"When peoples ask for advices, they sometime talks to more than one person. Seeking multiples opinions can help someone make a better choice. First, getting more than one point of view can help you see the problem from different angels. For example, if you're asking for advices on what college to go to, one person might say go to Harvard because it's the best school in the country. But another person might say go to a community college first to save money. If you only talk to one person, you might not of thought about the money issue. But with multiple opinions, you can see that there are different ways to look at the problem.

Another reason seeking multiples opinions can help is that people have different experiences. For example, if you're asking for advices on how to deal with a bully, one person might say just ignore them. But another person might say, no, that's not a good idea, you should stand up to them. If you only talk to one person, you might not of thought about standing up to the bully. But with multiple opinions, you can see that there are different ways to deal with the problem.

Finally, seeking multiples opinions can help you make a decision that you won't regret. For example, if you're asking for advices on whether to drop out of school, one person might say yes, it's a good idea because you can make more money working. But another person might say no, it's a bad idea because you won't have a degree. If you only talk to one person, you might not of thought about the long term effects. But with multiple opinions, you can see that there are different ways to look at the problem and make a decision that you won't regret.

In conclusion, seeking multiples opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows you to see the problem from different angels, people have different experiences, and it helps you make a decision that you won't regret. So next time you need advice, don't be afraid to ask more than one person.",1,107
"In paragraph 2 it was stated that Google cars aren't truly driverless. Also in paragraph 7 it was said that none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless and humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel. Finally, in paragraph 9 it asks who would be responsible if technology fails. I'm against driverless cars.

Humans need to know how to drive a car for simple actions. In paragraph 2 it says divers sometimes need to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as roadwork or accidents.

Stated in paragraph 7 none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless and humans need to stay alert. Human need to know how to drive a car in case technology fails or an emergency. If a human doesn't know how to drive a car and relies on the car, and you're in a dangerous situation, then the driver and passengers are most likely to be killed. A human needs to know how to navigate through work zones and around accidents. The Google Car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Safety is the number one most important thing when being in a car. It's the drivers job to make sure everyone in the car and themselves is safe. If someone is injured or technology fails, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture? Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

I'm against driverless cars because Google cars aren't truly driverless, humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel, and who would be responsible if technology fails.",0,108
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" David Goldberg. Automobiles have been a major impact on today's technology. The creation of the car was a huge turning point in history. Even though this machine has been such an amazing creation, it still causes a lot of damage in society. Cars affect both the environment and humans. The limit of car usage would be great because then the amount of pollution would decrease, less traffic would occur, and it makes way for alternative transportation opportunities.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. The reduction of cars can lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities are choking due to the increase number of emissions. Paris had hit near record pollution which lead to an enforced ban of partial driving to clear the air of the global city. According to Robert Duffer, Paris typically has more smog than other European capital. In Bogotá, Colombia there is a day called Day Without Cars, there they only let buses and taxis drive around, and their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If anybody goes against this, they would have to pay 25. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. This day became huge in Colombia and improved their cities overall look.

Furthermore, the limitation of car usage would decrease the amount of traffic. Traffic is an ongoing issue in everyday life. People arrive late to work or school or wherever they need to go due to traffic or an accident. During the Day Without Cars in Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses, leaving the city devoid of traffic jams. Traffic jams are usually stressful so if that gets reduced with the limitation of car usage, then stress levels get reduced as well, causing mentally healthier people. Traffic jams also occur due to accidents. Car accidents are one of the many reasons why people end up in hospitals, get sued, get hurt, or loose money. With the limitation of car usage, all these issues will be resolved.

Moreover, new alternative transportation vehicles can come into play with the reduction on car usage. There is a plan where they want suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved. Also, during the Day Without Cars, the goal is to promote alternative transportation. Lately, new transportation vehicles have been discovered and created. Some include, a flying car, an elevated train that gets you from point A to point B in seconds, and new hybrid cars. Technology keeps progressing every single day. Today people may be driving their normal SUVs but by tomorrow, they could be driving the new high speed flying Ferrari. People are always keeping in mind while creating these machines about how it will affect the community and the consumers. Since it is obvious that the environment isn't as healthy as it was before, they must make sure that these machines limit pollution and emissions that affect the world negatively.

Overall, the limit of car usage would be a good thing. As time goes on people may not even need cars anymore to move from place to place. If everyone works together to solve these issues then the world would become a much better place. The final goal is to get rid of all the bad emissions and issues and just stick to what is best for the environment. When the environment is healthy, the humans are healthy.",0,109
"Phones And Driving

Why should people use their phones if they are operating a vehicle? It is dangerous for someone driving a vehicle to use their phones because it can cause an accident. People should not use their phones while driving. People use their phones to text, answer phone calls, and to make plans. You can not do two things at once everybody uses their phones instead of paying attention to the road. You should always drive safe and make sure you stop at every traffic light. Furthermore, you should have drive at the speed limit. No car should ever go 100mph on the interstate or on a busy street. It will be hard to stop your car at a red light if you are going 100 mph. You will most likely get pulled over or get into a car accident if going that fast.

One reason you should not use your phone while driving is texting. One day you can be driving your car, and you will get a text message from someone. That person will look at their phone and pick it up and start texting back. They will be all into their phone and not paying attention to the road. He or she will be trying to text back and pay attention to their phone and the road at the same time. They can be driving and slam on the brakes and the car behind them can hit them from behind and that caused an accident all because that person was trying to text someone back. You should not text and drive at all. That is so dangerous if you drive looking at your phone. Its a lot of things that can happen when you are using your phone while driving vehicle. If you want to be on the phone with somebody while driving car you should get somewhere you can stick your phone in and talk to that person. You can also get pulled over by the police when using your phone while driving.

Picking up your phone to answer a phone call could also be dangerous. If you have to answer a phone call you should pull to the side of the road or wait to call that person back. Driving with your phone in you hand is dangerous because you will be busy trying to answer a phone call and not looking at the road. Your best option is to pull to the side of the road and answer the phone instead of driving with it in your hand. You can also get some earbuds to put in your ear, so you won't have to answer the phone with your hand. Holding a phone or tablet in your hand while driving is so dangerous. You can have a phone is your hand, but you will try to turn the steering wheel, and you will not make a perfect turn. So it is best for you to not have no phone in your hand. If you are driving a car and somebody behind you on their phone. Both of you people will get to a traffic light and the light will be red and you and the person will slam on brakes and most likely you will hit another car and the car behind you will hit your car. It will be your fault that you were on your phone and not paying attention to the road. Then you will most likely go to jail if that person you hit die. Depending on how bad that person is hurting you can get like 5 years in jail probably more than that. Everybody in this world need to just stop texting and driving.

Some people use their phones and look up at the road at the same time that is dangerous to.

Nobody should make plans while driving a vehicle. Some people make plans while on the phone with someone or typing it in their notes, so they won't forget. When making plans you should do that while you are at home. Making plans while driving a car can make you not focus on driving because you are trying to make plans. For example, you and a friend is in the car your friend is talking to you about going somewhere, and you are trying to listen to what she is saying and focus on driving that is not safe at all. Your friend should wait until you stop somewhere to make plans. Talking while driving is not safe, but you can talk and drive at the same time. When you are in the car with somebody you should just be focusing and not talking. When you in your car you should not play any loud music because you need to make sure you can hear surroundings. Like if you are in your car you might hear a police siren, but your music is too loud so you won't be able to hear the siren. Say you are in the car with your friend, and she tries to show you a fight that happened at your school, and you are driving a car you're looking at the fight not paying attention to the road, and you crash. It's your fault that you was looking at the phone and not paying attention to the road.

In conclusion, nobody should use their phone while driving. It is dangerous for you to text and drive. It is also illegal for you to use your phone while driving a vehicle. Furthermore, it's always safe for you to pull over to answer a phone if it is an emergency or to text someone back. No one should text and drive because that can ruin someone's life. All you have to do is pay attention to the road, and you can be safe. Don't try to look at your phone and drive a car at the same time ",0,110
"Summer projects, should they be teacher-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed because, if it is teacher-designed the student may not be motivated to do it.

Although Teacher-designed projects ensure that all projects are on topics that are appropriate for school, Students may not feel motivated to do a project on a topic that does not match their interests. There may be a few students that do not write on appropriate topics, but it is better than a larger amount of students not doing it simply because they have no interest in the topic.

If a student writes about a topic that is not appropriate for school, it is quite easy to have that student does a new project. If a student is having a hard time finding a school appropriate topic the teacher could recommend some things that they think would be a good topic for a project. Most students won't write about things that are not school appropriate; therefore it will be less-likely that there will be a large amount of students that do not do the project.

If a student is not interested in the topic that is assigned, there is nothing that they can do to change the way they feel about that topic. Having no power to change it, they will simply not do the project. If the students pick their own topics they will pick something that they are interested in. Students are more likely to do a project if it is on something that they are interested in. To ensure that the student is interested in the topic it is easier to let them pick their own topic rather than come up with several topics and let them choose.

School systems would benefit from letting students pick their own topics. Not only will more students turn in their projects, they will also have fun doing them. Teacher-designed projects may not motivate students to do them which is why it is better if summer projects are student-designed. The guarantee of appropriate topics would be nice, but the likelihood of the students turning their projects in is higher if the students pick their own topics.  ",0,111
"The Electoral College, the real group of electors, is a process in which the public selected the electors. These electors then cast there votes for the President and Vice President. In total there are 538 electors that participate in the process and a majority of 270 votes as necessary to elect the President and the Vice President. These electors are chosen from each state, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators. For the District of Columbia, since it's not a real state, it is awarded three electors due to the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution. The time to vote for electors is every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday. Some people disagree with this system, but the founding fathers of the U.S. had a reason for creating the Electoral College.

During a campaign a candidate might have a lot of appeal in one area. For example a candidate might HAE a lot of appeal in the north where there is barely any state that has more than eight electoral votes and confirm that the votes will go him. Those states with very low electoral vote count will not be enough to hit 270 total votes. This drives the candidate to spread his campaign to other locations to get more votes, not only for that but because he has no reason to stay in those confirmed states. So this makes everyone across the nation feel that there votes do count.

The opinion that goes against the Electoral System claims that the system isn't democratic and doesn't let the people directly vote for their candidate. Or another claim is that the people don't know who the electors are or what there intentions are.

It is true that it's not Democratic or that the electors are not well known. But the electors that the people vote for are usually picked out by the candidate or the candidates party, which are the people that you vote for. And by the time you got to vote for the electors they already are confirmed of who they are going to vote for so that gives no reason to doubt it.",0,112
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the driverless cars are not too far from our imagination and dreams. These cars could help us be safer on the road going to work, driving to school, or driving far distances. These smart cars could help us to not be Charles drivers and can help the number of crashes each year go down.

The driverless cars have a long way to go. The cars shoulder't be controlled only 90 percent of the time, and the other 10 percent by human. It would be more dangerous if it was only controlled a tinny percent by man and the rest by semi-autonomous cars. What if the driver gets bored and tired, then he falls asleep and the car needed him to take over? This is why we need a 100 percent driverless car. It would be safer.

Driverless cars would really come in handy with high schoolers just starting to learn to drive. High schoolers are very carless drivers, and care more about showing off or trying to have fun then they do about their own safety and everyone else's safety. With these smart cars, new drivers can be more safe. They couldn't be able to show off or maybe even try to go over the speed limited. These smart cars could also be useful with drunk drivers coming home from a party. Driverless cars have a long way to go, but they can really help us to be suffer and could help crime go down.",0,113
"I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. First, it's like, invasion of privacy. Like, we're in school to learn and stuff, not to have our parents breathing down our necks all the time. It's stressful enough already, you know?

And also, like, parents are not supposed to be the ones teaching us. That's the job of the teachers. If they're always checking up on us, it's like they don't trust the teachers to do their job. It's like, hello, we're in school to learn, not to be babysat.

And, like, if parents are always checking our grades and attendance, it's going to be like, a constant source of stress for us. We'll be worried about, like, what our parents will think if we don't do well on a test or something. It's like, we should be able to focus on learning, not on trying to impress our parents.

But, like, on the other hand, I guess it could be good for parents to know how their kids are doing in school. Like, if a kid is struggling, the parents can help them out and stuff. But, like, they could just, like, ask the teacher for an update or something. They don't need to be online every five minutes, checking up on us. That's just, like, too much.

"Staying Busy: The Key to Personal Success

As an 8th grader, I've learned that staying busy is crucial for personal success. When we're constantly engaged in activities, whether it's schoolwork, extracurriculars, or personal projects, we're more likely to achieve our goals and reach our full potential. In this essay, I'll explore the advantages of staying busy and the dangers of being idle, and how actively pursuing our goals can lead to positive results.

Firstly, staying busy helps us develop time management skills. When we have a lot on our plates, we learn how to prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and balance different responsibilities. These skills are essential for success in any area of life, whether it's academics, career, or personal relationships. By learning how to manage our time effectively, we can avoid procrastination and make the most of our time, leading to better grades, more productive work, and stronger relationships.

Secondly, staying busy keeps us motivated and focused. When we're constantly working towards a goal, whether it's a project, a test, or a personal challenge, we stay motivated and engaged. We're more likely to push ourselves to work harder and achieve more, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment and self-confidence. On the other hand, when we're idle and not challenging ourselves, we can easily fall into a rut of complacency and apathy, which can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of purposelessness.

Thirdly, staying busy can help us develop new skills and interests. When we're constantly learning and trying new things, we can discover hidden talents and passions, and develop new skills that can benefit us in the long run. For example, joining a sports team or club can help us develop teamwork and leadership skills, while volunteering can help us develop empathy and compassion. By staying busy and exploring new activities, we can broaden our horizons and discover new areas of interest that can lead to a more fulfilling life.

However, there are also dangers of being idle. When we're not challenging ourselves or staying engaged, we",1,115
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the topic of identifying a career before high school, as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about something that's really important for our future, and that's choosing a career. Some people think it's a good idea to figure out what you want to be when you grow up before high school, while others think it's better to wait and see what interests you. So, I'm going to share some reasons for and against identifying a career before high school.

First, let's talk about the pros of identifying a career before high school. One reason is that it can help you focus on your studies. If you know what you want to be when you grow up, you can start working towards it and take classes that will help you get there. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can take science and math classes to prepare yourself. This can help you stay motivated and make the most of your time in school.

Another pro is that it can give you a sense of direction. When you know what you want to do, you can start making plans and setting goals for yourself. This can help you feel more confident and in control of your future. Plus, it can be really cool to tell your friends and family what you want to be when you grow up, and they can support you in your goals.

Now, let's talk about the cons of identifying a career before high school. One con is that it can be really hard to change your mind. If you decide you want to be a doctor, but then you realize you don't like blood, it can be hard to switch to something else. So, it's important to keep an open mind and not get too attached to one idea.

Another con is that it can put too much pressure on you. If you know what you want to be when you grow up, you might feel like you have to work really hard to make it happen. This can be stressful and can make you feel like you're not good enough if you don't get into the right college or get the right job.

In my opinion, I think it's better to wait and see what interests you before choosing a career. That",1,116
"This article was stating that Venus is Earth's ""twin."" It is the closest in distance as well. Venus has many things wrong with it before anyone could ever live on it. Venus could be our nearest option for planetary visit. There is Earth like qualities but, it is very dangerous. Scientist still study this world because they know that if they could have a landing that was successful then they could final really start to explore the surface.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth. At times, we may be closer to Mars do to the speed at with the planets spin, but we are usually closest to Venus. Many spacecraft have been sent to Venus trying to learn more of it but each time that it has been attempted, it has only been able to last a few hours before failing. Venus is a challenging planet to be studied.

Venus has many issues, but there is prove that there may have once, long ago, been covered with oceans and had plenty of adaptable life on it. Today there are still some places on Venus that have Earth like features. Land forms that look the way Earth's do. There are valleys, mountains, and traders.

Though it is true that Venus is closest to us and may be the best option for visitation one day in the future it still has many problems. The planets surface area is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atomic pressure is 90 times as much as Earth. At this point in time Venus is habitat. There must be more research allowed on Venus to find out if anyone could ever step foot on it.

Venus must be researched more to learn as much as possible if it is said that it is the most livable planet. It has many dangers, yes, but that is to vary reason it needs more attention. The more time spent on researching Venus the more likely that we will be able to maybe reverse the effect to make it look as it did those any a year ago when it had bodies of water and valleys.",0,117
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by a popular vote of the American people. While the Electoral College was established by the founders with the aim of having each state be represented, I believe the popular vote better reflects the will of the citizens.

One argument often made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates tend to focus their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. This means that the vast majority of states receive little attention, and their citizens feel ignored. A popular vote system would encourage candidates to appeal to voters across the entire nation, not just selective swing states. It would make every vote truly equal and give voice to more Americans. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, small states would be neglected. Yet a popular vote does not diminish any state's role. Candidates would still try to earn support from voters in all 50 states. Some may express concern that large, population-heavy states would dominate national elections, but candidates would still need to form a majority coalition including many other states to win. A national popular vote does not advantage large states alone.

Most importantly, the popular vote aligns with the fundamental principle that in a democracy, the winner should be who receives the most individual votes nationally. While the Electoral College process usually results in the candidate who earned the most votes winning, it is possible for the candidate with fewer national votes to take office. This undermines the idea of one person, one vote. In an era where we have grown accustomed to seeing vote tallies nationally, the Electoral College system can seem unnecessarily complex and indirect. 

For these reasons, I believe changing to a national popular vote would strengthen our democracy and ensure that every American's ballot carries the same weight in selecting their president. The will of the national majority should be what determines the outcome each election. I encourage you to support electoral reform to implement this fairer system.

Thank you for your consideration.",1,118
"Was life better when we didn't have cars? There are many advantages to giving up our little privilege to ride around; If we as a community were to give up having cars we would have less pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emission and our communities would improve rapidly. We need to give up cars to form a better more safe environment for our families.

First off, an advantage to limiting car usage would be less pollution in our areas. ""Cold nights and warms days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission""(Duffer 15). ""In source 2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it also shows that because of the enormous amount of smog from cars they had to ban driving. After just 5 days of no car usage, the amount of pollution was down 60 percent. We as a people have to realize how drastic that change is. All we have to do to help the environment and nature grow more efficiently is to not use our cars as often.

Another advantage to lessening our use in automobiles is the reduction of green house gas emission. ""... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...""(Rosenthal 5). There our many programs and agencies trying to reduce greenhouse affects; such as the one above, by banning the use of cars; one being the Environmental Protection Agency. President Obama is also trying to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions as shown in source 4 ""the End of Car Culture."" David Goldberg, an official of the Transportation of America says ""All of our development since World War 11 has been centered on the car...""(Rosenthal 7). We as a people are so indulged with cars and how efficient they may be in some aspects we don't realize the harm its doing to our communities.

Lastly an advantage to the limitations of car usage, is our communities improving rapidly. An example of this is The day without cars improvement campaign in Colombia, shown in source 3. During this day people that lived in those areas would have to ride a bike, hike, take a bus or walk to work or school. Because of this there were no traffic jams and parks and sports centers bloomed. Also, because so many were involved in this, the sidewalks and streets were improved and new restaurants and shopping centers were developing.

In all, The effects of limiting car usage would cause less pollution, lesson the amount of greenhouse gas emission and cause our communities to improve rapidly. Fellow citizens we could change the way we live for the better. Limiting the use of cars would have a drastic change and help our communities blossom.",0,119
"Distance learning is a form of learning that allows students to learn outside the classroom setting through video conferences and online courses. This form of learning allows students to learn in any environment they want, whether that be their home, a library, or any other setting they feel most comfortable in. Although this may seem like a good option for students to opt for, students would not benefit more than opposed to learning from an actual classroom setting in a school building, especially when thinking about the resources and skills that schools can teach and offer.

One of the many reasons why schools exist is to provide a social setting that students are able to immerse themselves in. Schools provide a setting in which students are able to socialize with other students, creating a group or community for themselves as they form friends with the students they attend these classes with. This is not provided online; take home-schoolers, for example. Many home-schoolers report feeling socially isolated from people of their age group as a result of not having the social setting to thrive and form friendships in. These home-schoolers are not given the opportunity to create bonds with students because their classes are primarily online; it is because of their isolation that many home-schoolers find difficultly forming friendships with others. Online schooling and video conferencing takes away that social aspect of school, and can thus result in students who are unable to socialize with other people when it comes to the real world. However, there are people with certain anxiety disorders who would appreciate being able to learn from the comfort of their own home. But, immersing them in an environment that encourages social interaction would be a more ideal situation as they would be able to learn how to overcome their anxiety; there are more effective, and less drastic measures that can be taken to help a student with social anxiety as opposed to taking them out of the classroom setting altogether and replacing them with online settings.

Not only do schools and classroom settings provide the ability for one to form relationships and learn how to interact with other students and adults, they also instill the necessary cooperative skills that students need in the real world once they have completed their school career and move onto the next step of their adulthood. For example, schools have their students build collaboration skills through group projects; online schooling or video conferencing does not provide this same benefit of collaboration. When a student is working from the comfort of their own home, they are not actively collaborating with other students; it is essential for students to have the ability to cooperate with other people in the real world. These group projects add the benefit of teaching students how to work with others in order to get certain tasks done, preparing them for when they have to inevitably work with other people they may not necessarily like. Online schooling is largely independent, and requires the student to rely on themselves and only themselves, while classroom settings teach both independence and dependence. Students must learn how to work with other people so that they can learn how to deal with individuals who are difficult to cooperate with, and so that they learn to rely on others when in need of assistance.

Not only do online classrooms lack certain aspects necessary for a student to survival in the real world, but they also lack the accessibility of help when a student needs it. In a classroom setting, students are able to ask for help from their peers and teachers so that they can better understand the topic they are learning about. Online settings do not have this help accessible to their students all the time. Video conferencing may provide that needed assistance should a student need it, but students may feel uncomfortable asking for help as video conferences are typically done in masses; students who are all taking the course from home would be on the video call, and asking questions would require teachers to stop their lesson to re-explain a concept to everyone because one individual asked for help. In addition, video conferencing settings lacks the ability for that students to bond with the teacher, unlike classroom settings, which can increase their feelings of discomfort towards asking for help. An example of this lack of accessible help can be seen through London vision, an online system which allows students to take their classes from home and online. Many students who take courses through vision feel an overwhelming anxiety about taking the class because they do not have a teacher accessible to them; they are expected to complete overwhelming amounts of work without the help of a physical teacher nearby. As a result, many students procrastinate doing the work, and are thus left with more anxiety about the class in general. Students who take vision courses complain about their teachers, who have a tendency to fail them as a result of doing an assignment wrong because they did not understand it. It is because of these scenarios that physical classroom setting are more beneficial than online or video conferences, as they have the necessary resources for students to be able to ask for help.

When comparing distance learning and in-class learning, it is evident that students would benefit much more from being in a classroom setting than from learning in the comfort of their own homes. Not only do online classes and video conferences lack the ability for students to gain any sort of social skills, but they also lack the ability to teach students how to cooperate with one another, which is an important skill that students must acquire to survive the real world. In addition, in-class learning allows for students to ask for help when needed. It is because of this that students would not benefit from attending classes at home.",0,120
"I think that using the technology to read student emotional expression of student in a class is valuable because it helps to see if a student is happy/mad/sad. Like in the passage it's talking about how they are using this new technology call ''The Facial Action coding system ''Which mean -a system enables computers to identify human emotions. They are also using the 3-D computer model of the face, As they can also calculate the emotions. As because you can see what is wrong with your friend/family.

One reason why I think it's valuable for technology to read your emotional expression on students is by the program ''Facial Action Coding System'' why because just by using a video as it sates in the passage 4 ''using video imagery the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements ''they can see what kind of emotion you have and for them to help you out I am guessing or at less it can be value for making them feel better.Also, because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them. I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my mom/dead get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad.

It also can be valuable for student's in school because in that way you can help them out to feel better or sometimes you just don't know when that person is feeling happy or sad as it states in the passage 5 ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face '' and the new technology can help you read their emotions the way they are feeling. Another reason why it can help on students with the new technology by to imagine as it states in passage 6 and just by to imagine the computer will know when you are happy or sad. This can help us by helping them out and for them not to feel that way because sometimes when student's get mad they do thing they know shouldn't do but all that sadness or anger can take them over by causing harm. As it will be nice to stop the harm from someone doing it. Another example is this Wed ad as stated in the passage 6 as well now this wed can see your other emotions as an example.'' If you smile when a wed ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different.'' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored '' As Dr. Hangs predicts then he could modify the lesson because they want the student's to pay action in the classroom for them to learn and not make the class boring or for student to get lost and never asking question but as that to then the teacher will know what makes them get bored and what makes them get forces. This will help for many other student in school by not causing harm if they made and also by helping student not get bored or lose forces.

Now on my personal life I will say that the technology will help me by seeing how are people feeling when I see them walking around with their face down or just seeing them happy. Like for example lets say that I am walking around the hallway and see my friend with a serious face or just them not talking to I would like to use the technology and see what is wrong with them and try to help them out with the feeling they have and just try to change their mood. Another reason why I would like to help is by seeing how does my mom feel when she looks at me like just take a picture of her and see what are the emotion she has or as in passage say in 7 an ''encode ''different emotions like make her look at her self in the mirror and follow the steps it says and see what are the emotion she has. But yes the technology ''The Facial expression for each emotion are universal ''because it can help out in many always

As you see I do valuable the technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a class because it can help in many ways to see the way they are feeling in there emotion and in there way of leading. Just like Dr. Huang He doesn't want his student to lose forces and doesn't want them to feel sad either. Just like it will help in school for the student's.Also, as using the 3-D computer mood just by seeing and imagine it can see what kind of feeling you are having. As yes, it will be valued to use later in ;life well it will help me with my friends and even my own kids and students at schools.",0,121
"Summer vacation is a time for students to relax from all the work and stress associated with school. Teachers assign arduous assignments and projects that requires many hours to complete. Should summer projects be teacher -designed or student -designed? Summer projects should be student designed because students will be more inclined to do the project, student projects are unique, and it is a good experience for the youth.

Students will be more intrigued by projects created by their peers. Projects assigned by teachers are often dull and pointless. Having seen many projects assigned by adults, students understand the basis of a quality project idea. Peer designed projects are often more fun, as it was created by a young creative mind. Students will be more interested in taking part in student -designed projects over the summer.

Student -designed projects are unique, as they have participated in numerous projects. Teachers assign multiple projects per class in a given year. Students often find teacher -designed projects to be useless and is seen as busy work. Peers understand what a creative and helpful project consists of. Summer projects should be fun and easy because students worked hard all year. Student -designed projects would be relaxed and more unique.

Teacher -designed projects are often complex with multiple segments. Students look forward to a relaxing summer, as they worked very hard during the school year. School creates lots of stress and students often lose hours of sleep. Projects designed by teachers could be more beneficial to learning, but will intrude on the students time off. Stress is the last thing students need during their summer break.

Summer projects designed by students will be beneficial to both the student and teacher. Designing a project is a good experience for kids to have, as it helps with creativity and leadership. Summer projects should be student designed because students will be more inclined to do the project and student projects are unique. ",0,122
"I don't think we need driverless cars. It just makes humans even more lazy and is probably a waste on resources as well as time. My position on driverless cars are they are not needed just the fact that no one needs to have it. In paragraph seven it states, ""The car can handle functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but special touch sensors make sure that driver keeps hold of the wheel. This statement basically states that the car can only go up to twenty-five mph, but you have to be holding the wheel for it to do this. So your basically just sitting there as it just goes the only thing you're not working is the gas. You would have to watch just because if you were to work between work zones or accidents.

The most important thing for a driver in a car is safely. This car is posed to help that part out by using cameras to watch the driver and the road. If they were to def unction or break how would you get another one or would you be able to buy them in the store or pay for them again from the company. Also, if the technology or the car were to fail while the driver is distracted or worst and someone were to get injured, who is held in charge of it. Will the driver face the charge or the manufactures who made it?

Not to mention it doing all of this stuff at once, how much gas can go for one mile. We are trying to build cars that can go farther and not have that much gas, so what will be the mileage on this car that can drive itself. Will it run off of batteries, fossil fuels or something that doesn't harm the environment.

This ends my position on driverless cars on the road. I think it's not a good idea based off the fact that we came this far driving cars without them driving for us or anything like it. We can go without cars driving themselves, what we need to focus on is can we improve how far a car goes with just one gallon of gas so improving their mph. This would help people go farther without the cost of gas it would slow down the rate of resources going down and help our environment.",0,123
"Everyone knows that traveling outer space can be risky. Some many even say it is dangerous. Others may say that we can come up with better technology to improve safety when traveling other planets in outer space. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives their support to the idea of exploring the planet Venus.

Traveling Venus would be dangerous in many ways. For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun, so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle.

A way we could be able to visit Venus is if we had better technology. NASA has had quite a few ideas for sending humans to Venus. In the text it says, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" By using this sort of vehicle humans would be able to make the trip survivable.

The author of this passage seems to be very open and supportive of the idea of studying and listing Venus. In the paragraph 8 the author claims, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovations."" From this authors' statement we can infer that they are on board with the idea of the travels to Venus and that we should not like dangers or doubts hold us back from being able to study this planet. Although it may be challenging we must not let that stop us.

Although there may be many conflicting dangers and concerns with space travel, it is possible. As the author said, we should not let doubt stop us from discovering a great planet. We can come up with the technology to some day visit this planet. With the correct technology anything can be possible.",0,124
"Dear Principal, I am writing you a letter saying about changing the school policy I think that students should participate in sports and activities students should at least have a B or C average in a sport. So that what ever sport they play they can still be in it. We can see what the students think about it to see if they would what the policy change or not they probably think if they liked it change, or they don't liked it changed to have least have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I think some students would like the change and some others students probably like about the change of the policy that might be possible to change. I have no idea what they would think about the change to the policy that might be possible to be changing when you can only participate in sports or other activities like clubs and all the other stuff. My friend of mine told me she has a C average in one class and the rest she has like a B average she thinks she does. She also told me if it does change she would say she doesn't like the policy being changed. Because she said some students won't liked it any way. She bets some would at least like the idea of changed it to have least a B average. My other friends of mine don't want it to change. I agree with them about it possible about it being changed. That's all I got to write. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, P.S. I think some people would like the change so that way they can get better grades, so they can also go to the next grade that way they can go to college and live their Dr",0,125
"I believe that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. Social media has the power to influence people's beliefs, behaviors, and decisions. It provides a platform for the exchange of ideas, opinions, and information that can shape the way we think and act.

One example of how social media can impact societal norms and values is through the spread of misinformation. People often share false information on social media, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. This can result in a shift in societal norms and values, as people may base their opinions on inaccurate information.

Another example is the way social media can affect body image and self-esteem. Social media platforms are filled with images of perfect-looking people, which can lead to unrealistic beauty standards and body-shaming. This can negatively impact people's mental health and contribute to a culture of perfectionism.

On the other hand, social media can also be used for positive change. For example, it can be used to raise awareness of social and political issues, promote inclusivity, and connect people from diverse backgrounds. Through social media, we can learn from one another and develop a greater understanding of different cultures and perspectives.

In conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. Its impact can be both positive and negative, depending on how it is used. Therefore, we must use social media responsibly and critically, ensuring that we consume and share accurate information and promote positive values.",1,126
"Cars have become an indispensable part of our lives. We use them to get to work, go to the grocery store, and visit friends and family. But there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage.

First, limiting car usage can help to reduce pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which can lead to health problems such as asthma, heart disease, and cancer. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve air quality and protect our health.

Second, limiting car usage can help to conserve energy. Cars are a major source of energy consumption, and the production of cars and car parts also requires a lot of energy. By using public transportation, walking, or biking instead of driving, we can reduce our energy consumption and help to protect the environment.

Third, limiting car usage can help to improve our physical health. Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise, and they can help us to maintain a healthy weight. By reducing our time spent driving, we can make more time for physical activity and improve our overall health.

Fourth, limiting car usage can help to save money. Cars are expensive to buy, maintain, and insure. By driving less, we can save money on gas, parking, and other expenses.

Fifth, limiting car usage can help us to connect with our communities. When we walk or bike instead of drive, we are more likely to walk past our neighbors and interact with them. This can help to build a stronger sense of community.

In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve air quality, conserve energy, improve our physical health, save money, and connect with our communities.",1,127
"As an average 8th grade student, I believe that following one's instincts and ideas is crucial when making decisions in life. It's easy to get caught up in what others think or what we think we should do, but sometimes, our instincts can guide us to the best possible outcome. When we don't follow our instincts, we might end up in a situation that doesn't feel right or that we don't enjoy.

For example, I once had to choose between joining the school soccer team or the drama club. I had always loved playing soccer, but something just didn't feel right about it this time around. I went with my gut and joined the drama club instead, and it ended up being one of the best decisions I ever made. Furthermore, I discovered a new passion and made some amazing friends. If I had listened to my parents and coaches and joined the soccer team, I might have missed out on that opportunity.

Another time, I was thinking about what college I wanted to attend. My parents wanted me to go to a prestigious university, but I had my heart set on a smaller college with a better art program. I knew that I wanted to study art, but my parents were worried that I wouldn't be able to get a good job with a degree from a smaller school. In the end, I decided to follow my instincts and attend the college of my choice. It was the best decision I ever made, as I ended up getting an amazing education and making lifelong friends.

Self-reliance is a crucial life skill because it allows us to make decisions for ourselves and to trust our own instincts. When we rely on ourselves, we can make decisions that are best for us, rather than what others think is best for us. This can help us to be more confident and independent, and to make decisions that align with our values and goals.

However, it's important to note that seeking guidance from experts can also be beneficial. Sometimes, we might not have all the information or experience to make the best decision on our own. In those cases, it's okay to ask for help from people who have more knowledge or experience. For example, if I were trying to decide on a career path, I might seek advice from a career counselor or",1,128
"Many schools around the country design and assign summer projects for students to complete over the summer break. This is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break. Summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts. To better benefit the student, summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class.

Summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts. Teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching. Students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class. If the summer assignment was designed by the students, the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is.

For example, in classes I have always been give assignments created by my teachers. But, one class my teacher gave us an open-ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas. All the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project. The students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum. However, a teacher already knows the curriculum. This will allow for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course.

Not only do student not know the course concepts, students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class. When learning a new concept, students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics. At my school, some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic. My friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class. Students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher. A teachers job is to create assignments, tests, and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept. When teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students. If summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have. This would cause students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments.

People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher, so students do not need teacher guidance. But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum.

Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts. Summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves. Summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year.",0,129
"I highly think students should design, and the reason why I'm closing students is because, students need the opportunity to express what they feel plus, student are way more creative in my opinion. Some teachers think that the students shouldn't make their own prompts because I guess the teachers want the prompts to have reasons to them.

First, these props do sometimes get on my nerves in my opinion because were spending our time trying to figure out how OT set up the thesis and what examples can will fit with the paragraph and how does it support the idea. When the teachers make these prompts they expect us to get it right off the back and not struggle but some of them we have to sit back and think about how can this be an impact of how does this support the idea. Us students can be very excellent writers if we try and take our time, that's why if we get to write our own prompts about creative things and events that we've experienced.

Secondly, The reason why that I say that the teachers shouldn't write the paragraphs is because half of them are about school activities, there'ye never about fun things we don't on the weekends or how our breaks were there'ye always about adding extra hours in school, dress codes and adding extra class or something like that its near on things the students want to write about it always has to be school related near something fun.

Lastly, Some students may say that the teachers write better prompts but when you writes bout something you actually enjoy or love then you actually might consider because writing is another way of expressing how you feel, and it gives you different ways to say it. Writing is and important thing in life because when we go off to college it's going to get harder because were in the stage of becoming and adult grow up and college is no joke its way harder it's preparing you for the outside world (life) so enjoy writing while you can because it dent get any easier than this

In conclusion, I feel as if the students would write better prompts then the teachers in my opinion. We the students have more creativity than the teachers no offense but I'm just speaking the truth, us students can make writing prompts and other activities way more fun than it already is. What I'm trying to say is give us students a chance to write some prompts and make writing more fun and educational.",0,130
"What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.

To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Poster, ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.""  By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections.  What we don't know is if it will permanently work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these run-off elections.  The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" (Poster).  Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and one benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.

Moreover, the disaster factor has a huge impact on the electoral collage.  The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"" (Plume).  This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.  According to Plume, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated.  The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plume).  This goes to show, not only is the electoral college beneficial, but they can be sneaky.  The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.

Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.  As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" (Office of the Federal Register).  This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.  That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plume states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plume).  Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.  The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plume).  This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries' government.  Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?

All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.  Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?  By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard-working government we know it can be!  ",0,131
"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important choice or decision is beneficial for a few key reasons. First, getting different perspectives allows you to consider aspects of the choice you may not have thought of on your own. Different people will have had different experiences that shape their views, so hearing more than one side can help highlight both pros and cons you may have overlooked. 

Secondly, conflicting opinions force you to really examine your own feelings and rationale more closely. When people disagree on a choice, you have to think critically about why each perspective makes its case. This self-reflection helps ensure the factors most important to you personally are prioritized in your final decision. You can weigh opinions against your own values and priorities.

A third reason multiple opinions are valuable is that no one person has all the answers. Even well-meaning friends and family see things only from their own point of view. Collecting several perspectives increases the chances of getting guidance that aligns with reality. One advisor might miss something another could catch. The convergence of consistent advice from different sources builds confidence that the consensus view has merit. 

Finally, taking time to consider multiple opinions shows good decision-making. It demonstrates you are a thoughtful, careful person who does not make important choices lightly. Consulting others is more mature than acting hastily on an initial gut reaction. The process of comparing varied viewpoints also gives you stronger justification for your ultimate decision if questions arise later. Weighing a diversity of advice helps ensure the choice you make is well-informed and in your best long-term interests.

In conclusion, seeking multiple perspectives provides distinct advantages over relying on a single opinion when facing significant decisions. Hearing from more than one trusted advisor leads to choices that have been scrutinized from numerous angles and therefore have a greater chance of being the right one for your own unique circumstances and priorities. Multiple inputs result in wiser, more well-reasoned selections.",1,132
"As the saying goes, ""It takes a village to raise a child."" Indeed, children's education is not just the responsibility of teachers, but also of parents. In my opinion, all parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools. This essay will explain my position with specific reasons and examples.

Firstly, volunteering at school can help parents better understand their children's education. Many parents may be unfamiliar with the school's curriculum or teaching methods. By volunteering, they can observe how their children learn and interact with classmates and teachers. This experience can give them insights into their children's strengths and weaknesses, as well as their interests and needs. For example, a parent who volunteers at a reading group may notice that their child struggles with phonics or that they have a passion for science. Armed with this knowledge, parents can better support their children's learning at home and communicate effectively with teachers.

Secondly, volunteering can foster a sense of community and connection between parents, teachers, and students. When parents are involved in school activities, they can meet other parents and form friendships. These relationships can help parents feel more connected to their children's school and more invested in their education. Moreover, parents who volunteer can serve as role models for their children. They show that education is important and that everyone has a responsibility to contribute to the community. For instance, a parent who volunteers as a soccer coach can inspire their child to be a team player and to value physical activity.

Thirdly, volunteering can be an opportunity for parents to use their skills and talents to benefit the school. Parents have a wide range of talents and expertise, such as cooking, gardening, or graphic design. By volunteering, they can share their skills and enrich the school's programs. For example, a parent who is a chef can organize a healthy cooking workshop for students, while a parent who is an artist can create murals or posters to decorate the school. This kind of contribution can make a big difference in the school's atmosphere and can inspire students to pursue their own interests and talents.

Of course, some people may argue that requiring parents to volunteer is an infringement of their freedom and privacy. They may argue that parents have busy lives and should not be compelled to spend extra time at school. However, I believe that volunteering should be seen as a civic duty, not a burden. Education is a public good that benefits all members of society, and parents have a special responsibility to ensure that their children receive the best education possible. Moreover, volunteering can be flexible and can take many forms, such as attending a parent-teacher conference, chaperoning a field trip, or making a donation to the school. There are many ways to contribute, and parents can choose the ones that suit their schedules and preferences.

In conclusion, all parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools. Volunteering can help parents understand their children's education, build community, and use their skills to benefit the school. It can also show children the value of education and civic engagement. As a society, we should recognize the importance of education and the role of parents in supporting it. By working together, we can create a better future for our children and for ourselves.

"Student Summer Projects

During the summer we all have received some sort of project or assignment that would be due during the first week of school. However, the projects are always assigned by teachers on what they think that is best for us. Not all students are pleased with the fact that we have to do work during the break. Considering that they just went to school for almost ten months and still have teachers think about what the students should do during summer break it's not fair. In my opinion I think that teachers should let students choose their own summer projects because they can have fun while making the project, turn the project however they like into something creative and have them be motivated. Summer is the time to not stress about assignments that are complicated. Instead, it should have the student be interesting to have something to do so they can remember the memories they made while making the project.

Summer is the time when students can be stress-free and just have fun with friends and family. Including the fun activities they enjoy doing. That should be the main idea of a summer project because letting students decide how they want to do their own projects will keep them motivated on doing it because they can express their creative minds onto something they know they won't get judged on. For example, Most people even without having to do a school project, the majority of teenagers want to document their summer to show everybody what they did, to remember the amazing sunsets or sunrises throughout summer or the cool places they went too and family events that happened. As well with trying new thing that you didn't think you would enjoy but by the help of the summer project you made, you learned a lot more about yourself. Either by the help of a friend or by just finding new activities that interested you by reading it or by seeing a commercial. Students want to share every detail of it because it was something they experienced during those two months that made them happy and not feel overwhelmed with stress that was over their heads because of a boring assignment their previous teacher assigned them before school ended.

In addition, while students are making the project they can work individually. Some may feel more motivated to think outside the box on what your whole topic should be or how they can make it happen. However, with a group project you can work with friends make it even more adventurous. Some students may think differently instead of going out they can make an invention or make something from scratch, the possibilities are endless because it would be up to the student to create something unique that teachers may not have thought of before.

When teachers design projects sometimes it isn't the type of projects that we all expect. You can't really be creative because the majority of the time they will give you a template of the important things you should actually do, and it just gets rid of the fun of doing the project because you're only doing what it is asking you to do. As well with having teachers design the project it wouldn't make much sense because you passed all your classes as well with the grade you just passed. During the summer you don't have any teachers that you're enrolled in yet in their class. That's the main reason why I think it shouldn't be up to the teachers to design and have the students instead.

In conclusion, I strongly think that summer projects should be student-designed rather than having teachers designed the project because summer is the time when even if you're a teacher student, principle. It is your summer and your own experience. You should at least as a student have the control of what your own summer project should be about during your summer break because it is where you mostly spend time with family and friends just enjoy everybody's time. Also, it helps you think in many ways on how you can make your summer the best one yet by doing many activities or starting new hobbies just because of this project and learn yourself at most by just having fun. A project doesn't have to be boring, you just have to find what interests you and what helps you keep motivated.

"There are many benefits to teaching children to cooperate. One of the most important is that it helps children learn how to get along with others. This is important because it will help them in their personal lives and in their careers.

Another benefit of teaching children to cooperate is that it helps them learn how to work together. This is important because it will help them in their professional lives. They will be able to work together to achieve a common goal.

Finally, teaching children to cooperate helps them learn how to compromise. This is important because it will help them in their personal relationships. They will be able to find a middle ground that everyone can agree on.

"Dear Principal,

I am a student of your school, and I am against the rules of the grade requirement.

Most of the students in the school have a C grade average, so it takes away from them, and C is passing, so I believe they should be allowed to participate still as long as they have a C average.

Many kids are very good at sports and activities and all of them aren't always smart, and they might not be able to live life out how they could be so successful. School is a big part of life, but it is not always everything, grades should not be centered around sports, I believe. Pro athletes do not have to have a B average, so why would kids have to do school things to be able to do sports?

Some kids with disabilities, they might be really good at sports or other activities after school, and they might not get the B average, are we going say no to people that can really be successful in life at those skills, just because they didn't have the best grades in school? That would be ruining a kid's life, as he grows up, and he could have really been something in those activities, but his grade messed him up, and maybe he really tried his best.

I think we should change the rule, and give people the right to do the activities. Grades are supposed to be up, but not everyone is smart enough, and they try, but maybe they just can't get it. So I believe that the grade requirement should not be that high, or have one at all.

"Studying abroad is an excellent opportunity for college students to gain real-world experiences in a foreign culture. It allows students to develop language proficiency, increase their knowledge of the world, and become more independent. Therefore, I believe that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.

First, studying abroad is an effective way to learn a language. Students are forced to use their language skills in everyday interactions with locals, which encourages local speech patterns and slang. Additionally, many universities offer study abroad programs specifically aimed at language learning. For example, the American University in Paris offers an immersion program in which students attend French classes and participate in cultural activities, such as field trips and excursions. By putting themselves in an environment where they are immersed in the language, students are able to make more rapid progress in their language skills.

Second, studying abroad provides an opportunity to deepen one’s knowledge of the world. When living in a foreign country, students are exposed to the culture, customs, and values that are unique to that place. For example, a student spending a semester in Japan may learn about the importance of respect in Japanese culture and how it affects the way people interact with each other. This knowledge helps to create a more holistic understanding of the world, which is invaluable for college students.

Lastly, studying abroad encourages independence and self-reliance. When living away from home and in a foreign country, students must learn to take care of themselves. This includes tasks such as navigating public transportation, finding housing, and shopping for groceries. Additionally, since students are in a new place where they don’t necessarily know the language, they must learn to make decisions on their own and handle problems as they arise. All of these skills are invaluable life lessons that students can carry with them throughout their lives.

In conclusion, I believe that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country. Not only will this provide an opportunity to learn a language, deepen one’s knowledge of the world, and become more independent, but it is also an invaluable experience that will shape and enrich the lives of students.

"Hi I am Luke, and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. A SeagoingCowboy is someone that sails on a boat and the boat has farm animals that you take care of. I have been a SeagoingCowboy for nine years, and I am still fascinated at all the places we go to. I have been to the Acropolis in Greece, I also rode a Gondola in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Would you like to be a SeagoingCowboy it's a lot of fun and I forgot to tell you also get to feed the farm animals. It's a very long sail, but it's worth the sightseeing. The night watch is like a job you have to check on the animals every hour to make sure their okay. But the night watch could be scary one time I fell and cracked my ribs.

There are also some fun things you can do on the ship once you drop of the animals. When you're returning from dropping of the animals you can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Ping-Pong's tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped pass time on the boat.

The animals on the ship were pigs, sheep, chickens, cows, roosters, horses, and goats. The most liked animal was the horses because they were nice, and the fur was very soft. Every time at night you could hear the animals for a little then they would final settle down.

Would you like to be a SeagoingCowboy if not that's okay, but it's very fun? Being a SeagoingCowboy keeps you active, and it helps you learn responsibility and being trustworthy. There are signups next year in New Orleans, Louisiana. This is Luke we will see you in New Orleans next year.",0,138
"There are good benefits and bad benefits of not having a car. With your legs being your transportation to get around the city, allows you to get a new experience of getting around. But it can also be pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have to walk everywhere you want to go. But the more walking you do, the less money you're spending. Having no worries about paying for gas, car notes, tickets, etc.

Another good thing about not having a car is staying in shape. Walking around to get to where you need to go would get you more than plenty excerise. Nothing like having a nice healthy body, burning calories, and even pounds. Having nice strong and healthy heart and burning off the fat that you put on by doing nothing and being physically active by walking.

Fewer accidents, car jams, traffic problems, and even car solution. What parent doesn't want a cleaner air for there children to breathe? Fewer cars can somehow lead to a safer environment. Less car accidents dealing with people texting and driving, which could lead to less possibilities of death, maybe.

No one wants to walk everywhere their trying to go, nothing wrong with going for a nice bike ride there. Limiting car usage can maybe differ the world, cause less problems, fewer worries, and the best of all. . . SAVE MORE MONEY!  ",0,139
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to argue that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to electing the president by nationwide popular vote. While the Electoral College has its intentions of giving voice to smaller states, I believe the popular vote would better represent the will of all American citizens.

One argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign across many states. However, research shows that candidates largely focus their efforts on only a handful of swing states that could vote either way. This means that many states are ignored during campaigns. Switching to the popular vote would motivate candidates to campaign everywhere and develop policies that appeal to a wide variety of Americans from different backgrounds. 

It is also argued that the Electoral College protects the influence of smaller states. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates win the Electoral College despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the one person, one vote principle that is so important in our democracy. While smaller states may receive slightly less individual attention under a popular vote, every vote would carry equal weight. Candidates would still visit a variety of large and small states to maximize their vote totals.

A possible counterargument is that foreign powers could try to influence the national outcome through campaigns in just a few highly populated states. However, this same risk exists in our current system, as opponents might spend large sums in swing states. Additionally, switching to the popular vote may increase national voter turnout and civic participation, countering any foreign influence efforts.

In conclusion, adopting a nationwide popular vote would make every citizen's ballot equally important and better align presidential elections with our democratic values. While the Electoral College was well-intentioned, it no longer serves the needs of our large, mobile society. I urge you to support election of the president by popular vote to give voice to all Americans. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,140
"The value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions is an extremely smart idea. They see if they were confused or not. This software could help kids understand their assignments easier, explain more things thoroughly, and break the subject down into smaller sections.

The way that this software could help kids understand their assignments easier is that it could read their emotions while they're taking notes and the teacher says something they don't understand. The software could then read that emotion of confusion and show them a simpler way to understand it. Thus making the lesson easier to understand, so they could actually do their work right instead of doing it completely wrong.

Another way that this software could help students understand things better is that it could explain more thoroughly. For example, a student could be sitting in math class and taking notes. The kid might not understand what the teacher means as he's talking about a specific formula. The software could recognize the look and explain it better to the student so that they understand what they meant.

The last reason why this software could be useful is that it could break down in the lesson into smaller sections. A kid could be completely lost on what he's learning about in science, and they're overwhelmed by everything together. The program could recognize the confusion of the kid. It could then break the whole lesson apart and explain it one step at a time so could make more sense to them.

In conclusion, this software could do amazing things to help students understand and comprehend a lesson better than anything else. While this program will probably never be available for my education, it would be amazing asset for future students. The software could make it easier for assignments to be understood, explain a lesson further than the teacher did, and break lessons down into smaller sections. This software is the future for our world's education.",0,141

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one, single person. In the past, I have asked more than one person what they think. Most people also ask more than one person for something as well. Seeking multiple opinions is good because you can get multiple opinions and compare them, and you can get multiple opinions for things people have experienced and haven't experienced.

The first reason people should ask for more than one opinion is they could get multiple opinions and compare them. It's sort of like taking a survey, but in this case you are surveying peoples opinion. You would take someone's opinion then go to another person and get their opinion. You could do this with more than just one person. For example, if you are going to try a new food at a restaurant, you go either ask people in person what their opinion is or go online to the review section of the restaurant website or rating website. You would then take everyone's opinion and see the pros and cons for the food you want to try. The pros and cons could be about one certain dish you might want to try or about the restaurant its self. This is how taking many opinions is good for making a better choice.

The second reason you should take multiple opinions is you can get opinions from people who have done and haven't done whatever you are trying to get an opinion on. You could take someone's opinion if they have done whatever you are getting an opinion for. They might have experienced it before, but you could also take someone's opinion if they haven't tried it before but get their opinion on what they think of it. For example, if you want to try something like a new ride at an amusement park, you could ask someone who has already ride the ride and someone who hasn't. You would get the person who already rode the ride their opinion of what they thought of the ride when they rode it like did it have loopty-loops, if it is really fast, or if it is a spinning ride. You would then get the person who hasn't tried it and see what they think from just seeing and hearing about the ride. Furthermore, you could then get the pros and cons of each and decide whether to go on it or not. For this reason, you should take more than just one opinion.

In conclusion, you should get more than just one opinion about making a better choice. You could get multiple opinions and compare them. You could also get them from people who have experienced whatever you are getting an opinion about and someone who hasn't done it. For these reasons, you should get more than just one opinion to make a choice.",0,143
"The Electoral College is something that should be kept for our government voting system. When people vote for the president and are not really voting for their president they want, they should be able to directly vote for the person they want to win. With the Electoral College in place, you are not able to do so. There should be two forms of voting.

When the poll is taking place, people should place their votes and have those be shipped off to the Electoral College and have the votes be taken there. But, there should be another copy for the votes to be cast directly to the election. This will help when someone wins electoral vote and loses national popular vote and the other way around. It can still happen to where someone wins electoral votes and wins national popular vote. With this method, their will be fewer debate over who should truly be the president they choose.

If any of these options are off of the table, then there should be a law that there should be no winner-takes-all majority voting. When 49% of the state want one president to win and 51% want the other, that should be equally distributed across the presidential election. When there is that little of a gap in between votes, that is the reason why people win national popular vote over electoral votes right there. People should obviously get the president that they want their country to be watched over by, but there should be a little change in how that president comes to be.

To be president, you need to catch the peoples eye and try to do great things for your country. People who vote for you, obviously want you to be there president and have you take care of them. When you win the electoral college votes, but lose the national popular votes, that means you have lost the election. This is another reason why the winner-takes-all majority vote for the electoral college should be taken off of the table.  ",0,144
"Recently the principle made a big change to our school. He decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. After I heard about this, I started thinking of how this can impact our school. Some students might disagree with this new change, but I actually agree with the principle's decision. There might be some minor ways on how this can effect students, however, I think this could be a great way to improve students mental health. Students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity because this could make students more productive, help students find something they might be passionate in, and have a great way to make new friends.

The first reason why I agree with the principle is that it can make students more productive after school. There are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. Most of the time, I can be one of those students. Usually when I come home after school, I always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. When I get on my phone, I can get so invested in it, that I don't even realize I have a lot of homework assignments to do.

Being lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. Most students probably have been in the same situation as me. Although, if those students were to be in an extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. For example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. Another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. Doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device. To sum up, extracurricular activities are a good way to help someone have a productive task to do.

The second reason why I agree with the principle is that extracurricular activities can help some students find something to be passionate in. There are some students who might not have any activity or hobby they're passionate in. If those students had to take an extracurricular activity, they would have a more chance of finding something they like. Some students might even end up liking an activity they never thought they would. Every school gives many options in extracurricular activities. If a student tries out an activity, and they don't like it, they can always try a different one. Also, another benefit in finding an activity you like, is getting a lead to a career you might want to have in the future. It's always good to know what you're passionate in, so you can have more options for future careers.

The final reason why I agree with the principle is that joining in extracurricular activities can be a great way to make new friends. Socializing and making friends is important for anyone's mental health. Friends can be supporting and a helping hand at any time. The friends you make can also build a strong character in you. If you join an extracurricular activity that you really like, it can be easier to make friends because they will have the same interest as you. Because of the similar interests, the friends you make through an activity can be closer than the friends you make in class. Making friends gets you to know other people in your school, and it's better to know more people, so you can feel more comfortable at school. All in all, extracurricular activities can be the best opportunity in making great friends.

There may be other ways that extracurricular activities can benefit students, but the reasons I thought of were the most important to me. With extracurricular activities students can be more productive, find an activity they might be passionate in, and make new friends. Also, extracurricular activities can play an important role in life by leading you to a career. For the students who don't agree in partaking in any activity, just keep in mind that It's always better to try new activities because you might end up liking it! ",0,145

" Promptness is something that we all strive for, but sometimes things don't go as planned, and we need to think first before taking action. In my opinion, being prompt is crucial in many aspects of life, and it's important to prioritize it.

Firstly, being prompt is important in the workplace. If you're late to work, it can lead to missed deadlines and a loss of productivity. It's also important to be prompt when it comes to meeting deadlines or completing tasks. For example, if you're working on a project, and you miss a deadline, it could lead to delays and additional work.

Secondly, being prompt is also important in personal relationships. If you're always late to appointments or events, it can damage your relationships and make people feel like you don't value their time. It's important to be respectful of other people's time and to make an effort to be prompt whenever possible.

However, being prompt is not always easy. Sometimes, unexpected events can occur that are beyond our control, such as traffic jams or public transportation delays. In these situations, it's important to be flexible and adaptable. We can try to plan ahead and leave extra time for unexpected events, or we can find alternative routes or modes of transportation.

Another way to be prompt is to prioritize tasks and create a schedule. By creating a schedule and breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones, we can ensure that we're making progress and staying on track. It's also important to be mindful of our time and to avoid distractions.

In conclusion, being prompt is crucial in many aspects of life. It's important to prioritize it and make an effort to be prompt whenever possible. By being respectful of other people's time, planning ahead, and avoiding distractions, we can ensure that we're making the most of our time and achieving our goals.",1,149
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the Electoral College system should be kept for electing the President of the United States. While moving to a popular vote seems appealing in some ways, I believe the Electoral College encourages greater voter participation and protects the interests of smaller states.

One concern about a popular vote is that it could discourage voter turnout, especially in states that are not considered swing states. Currently, candidates try to appeal to voters in competitive states, which encourages high voter participation in those locations. However, with a national popular vote, candidates may focus all their attention on heavily populated areas. This could reduce incentives for people in other parts of the country to vote. 

It is also important to remember that the United States was designed as a federal republic composed of individual state governments. The Electoral College system helps to balance state and national interests. Smaller population states rightfully worry that candidates would ignore their issues in a national popular vote. The current system guarantees that smaller states still have a meaningful say in presidential elections. This helps maintain the federal character of our system of government.

Of course, some critics argue that the Electoral College can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. While this has happened a few times, it is a reflection of how candidates must build a nationwide coalition, not just win the most total votes. A nationwide plurality system may also have its flaws.

In conclusion, while the popular vote idea has some intuitive appeal, I believe the Electoral College overall serves our democratic process better by encouraging broad voter participation and respecting the interests of all states. It has worked reasonably well for over two centuries and remains the best system for presidential elections. I hope you will consider opposing any proposals to abandon it.

Thank you for your consideration. Let me know if you have any other questions.

"Dear principal,

I think that you shouldn't make it a mandatory thing. If kids wanted to volunteer they would. I think everyone should do something to help the community, but making someone do something they really don't care about will just make them mad and or dislike you. I know not everyone will like what you do and roles would be roles. But still. Maybe if we had a bunch of fun volunteering projects kids could do through school it would make it easier for them to see volunteering doesn't have to be just like picking up trash (which is a good thing but honestly no fun) you could go to a pet shelter and play with the animals. Or I always that it would be fun to train service dogs for the blind or something like that. Or go to a soup kitchen and feed the homeless, that's what I do. I don't know, I don't think the principal would change his mind about roles for the school by one latter from a student, but it's just my opinion on community projects. Thanks for reading my letter!

"To Principle:

Community service is something people do voluntary, not something that should be required. Students have other things to worry about such as studying, homework, chores etc. There are already a lot of adults who volunteer for community service, and there's people who by law are forced to. Kids on the other hand shouldn't have to. Students don't need something else on their shoulders, school is for learning and nothing else.

Students have to study no matter what. Community service is like an obstacle that prevents kids to actually study. Already there are many students who don't study at all, and making all students do community service would discourage the small percentage who do. Doing things like cleaning and taking care of younger kids can be tiring. Even adults get tired of doing these things, imagine how a minor would feel. When a student is tired and has the choice to study or not they would most likely rather not; well after so much work they have just done. Not studying can lower test scores, and not to mention lower student grades.

As studying weren't enough of an issue, with all this community service where can a student find time to do their homework? Of course, those who choose to volunteer for community service find their way; they figure out their own schedule. But what about those new goers? A change of schedule can be very frustrating, especially when it means doing your homework late at night. There's another reason why it could affect the use of homework. When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is awful because students end up having fewer hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible.

What about certain chores students have to do at home? Parents as we all know are very strict about chores, and when a kid doesn't accomplish them, parents can get really mad. Of course, you can prevent that by actually doing them in first place; but what if you have to community service first? Your parents might understand the situation you in, so they'll probably postpone ""clean up"" day to the weekend. Which is the only days a student has to forget about their troubles at school. There's another reason, socially this would ruin social activity after school; since students have to study, do their homework, and do their chores all before bedtime. Chores are enough, why do city chores the community already volunteers for.

In conclusion, I believe the idea of making students do community service is absurd and completely irrational. Students have social lives they need to fulfill. Our tax money is going to the cause anyway so why bother. People get paid for this stuff, so it shouldn't be a privilege. Community service just shouldn't be required in school, it should be voluntary.

"I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their kids grades and attendance online. First, it's like, totally invasion of privacy. Like, I get that parents want to know how their kids are doing in school, but they don't need to know every single grade and attendance record. That's like, between me and my teacher, you know? It's not their business.

And also, it's like, really stressful for kids. Like, if my parents are always checking my grades, I'm going to feel so much pressure to get good grades. And what if I don't? Like, what if I'm not doing well in a certain subject? My parents are going to be all like, ""What's wrong with you? Why aren't you getting A's?"" And it's just, like, too much.

And also, it's not like, good for kids to have their parents always checking up on them. Like, we need to learn how to be responsible and independent. If our parents are always watching us, we're never going to learn how to do things on our own. It's like, they need to trust us and give us some space.

But, like, on the other hand, I can see why parents would want to monitor their kids grades and attendance. Like, they want to make sure we're doing well and not, like, skipping school or something. But, like, there are other ways to do that. Like, they could just ask us how we're doing, and we can tell them. Or they could, like, talk to our teachers and get a progress report or something.

So, in conclusion, I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their kids grades and attendance online. It's just, like, too much, and it's not good for kids. We need some privacy and independence. But, like, I get why parents would want to do it, so maybe there can be, like, a compromise or something.",1,153
"Why would anyone want to become a Seagoing Cowboy, you might ask. There are actually many reasons why someone should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Like I said, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""

If you are working as a Seagoing Cowboy, then you know the feeling of when you accomplish something great. It's all one big rush of happiness, excitement, and success. Later on in life you will get to say, ""I helped someone, and I'm proud"" That is just one of the many reasons.

If you like working with animals, then this might be a job for you. When I was working for the Seagoing Cowboys program, I got to work as a watchman. When you are a watchman you have to check on the animals every hour. That was an amazing experience, trust me.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all work all the time. You can find time to have fun like I did. I got to play exciting volleyball and baseball games. Along with that, I had time to read, box, fence, whittle, and play in table-tennis tournaments.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to visit amazing place such as I. You can get the chance to go to through the Panama Canal and tour a castle in Crete just on your way to China! That's not all! You can take a gondola ride in Italy, and see the Acropolis in Greece. Just think of all the amazing places you'll go.

When I was a Seagoing Cowboy was the best time of my life. It gave me wonderful chances and a life full of excitement. It could give you that too. All you have to is joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will not regret it, I promise.  ",0,154
"Wouldn't it be cool if everyone participated in an extracurricular activity? I feel that everyone should be involved in an after school event, it can be beneficial in so many ways. Kids would make new friends, wouldn't be bored all the time, and it would be healthier for them.

Having an extracurricular activity would be healthier for students. Sitting at home all the time is not healthy for anybody, many people can become depressed, lonely or just really bored. Getting out of the house more, you can get more exercise. It's healthier to be around people then to be alone all the time at home.

This is also a perfect way to make new friends. A lot of people have friends that they hang out with all the time, this would be a good way to have more friends. Meeting someone at an after school event can mean that you share similar interests. That being said you would get along more because you can take about you similar hobby.

A lot of kids go home and become bored because ta have nothing to do. Finding something to do can also be difficult. Having an extracurricular activity would give you something to do after school. Some kids get into trouble when they have nothing else to do, but if they had something to do after school hey should be fine.

Although some people would not agree with me, if you can be healthier, make new friends, and avoid being bored, having an extracurricular activity wouldn't be such a bad idea. All in all, having an after school activity can be beneficial in so many ways.",0,155
"Greetings Mr. State Senator,

Looking over the Electoral College, there has come to be a few interesting details. Yes, the process is beautiful thought out but as we look at it deeper it has its flaws. The founding fathers have given us the Electoral College, which anarchist are very unappreciative viewing it as a non-democratic way to vote.

If the Electoral College system goes, then Americans can have their full Constitutional rights. Using this process voters are not voting for the elector of their choice, voters are voting on higher qualified voters to vote for the elector. The whole process is a violator of the amendment entitled to voting. Having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of whom the elector is voting for so their vote ISIN actually going to the candidate of their choice. In 1960 before the election of John F. Kennedy, the segregationists of the Louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all the Democratic electors with electors who opposed John F. Kennedy. So all the voters in favor of JFK. Will be voting against him and all the Electoral College votes would be going to the other candidate.

As Bradford Plume says in an excerpt from:

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" Plume makes a very valid point because of the size of states. The electoral College's number of representatives are as big as their states' population. So if all the representatives in Alaska vote on the Republican candidate, and most of the people in California vote for the Democratic candidate, the Electoral College vote in California overrules the vote in Alaska.

The Electoral College can make some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote doesn't count as much. Many voters in larger states refuse to vote because their vote won't really change the Electoral Collage's vote. The voters don't have total control over an elector, so the whole election crisis could happen again.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted, but today the modern society doesn't appreciate its lack of Constitutional rights. All we ask is for our right to vote to be given to us, so we can take part in our government.

"The thing they saw is just a natural landform. There is no evidence that someone could have made it. It's just the was people look at it making them think that it's a face. Things occur and just move things and make them look different. They may also make different shapes and objects. There is no evidence that aliens could have done it.

My opinion is that the way things move things could have crashed into it and made it look like a face. Its just something natural that happened. They don't have enough evidence to show what caused the face to form. Many things could have happened for the face to form, but it doesn't mean that aliens or ancient things could have done this.

NASA has been putting a lot of money into this to see what caused this thing to form. They think there is life on that planet and that is what caused it to form and something made that thing that looks like a face. They saw that there wasn't any alien movement that it WS just a natural landform and that's what is. No aliens could have done this face. The thing that they thought was a face was just a mesa.

All of this was just that they thought aliens had done the face. But then they discovered that there was no alien movement and figured out that it was just a mesa. They were done with their research because they had nothing else to do with the mesa that they thought something had formed it.  ",0,157
" The debate surrounding whether high school students should take school programs that allow for early graduation in three years instead of the traditional four years is an ongoing one. While some argue that these programs provide students with the opportunity to graduate early and start working or attending college sooner, others believe that the benefits of taking these programs are outweighed by the potential drawbacks.

One of the main arguments in favor of early graduation programs is that they allow students to graduate early and begin their careers or further their education sooner. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are not planning on attending college, as they can start working and earning money sooner. Additionally, students who are able to graduate early may be more motivated to pursue higher education or other post-secondary opportunities.

However, there are also several potential drawbacks to consider when it comes to early graduation programs. For example, students who take these programs may be required to take classes during the summer or after school, which can be time-consuming and may interfere with their ability to participate in extracurricular activities or spend time with family and friends. Additionally, students who take these programs may be less able to take elective courses, such as foreign language, nutrition, music classes, computer skill class, or HPE, which can be an important part of a well-rounded education.

Another potential drawback of early graduation programs is that they may put students at a disadvantage when it comes to college admissions. Many colleges and universities require students to complete a certain number of credit hours before they can graduate, and students who take early graduation programs may not have the same opportunities to complete these credit hours as those who take the traditional four-year program.

In conclusion, while early graduation programs may provide some benefits for high school students, it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks before deciding whether to take one. Students should weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision about whether an early graduation program is the right choice for them.",1,158
"There are many advantages of not using a car. It's a good opportunity to lower air population, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. In addition, everyone is getting active instead of using a car to transport them where they need to go.

Passengers are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Not using cars can lower air populations. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France after 5 intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most populated cities in the world. After banking even numbered license plates the smog cleared enough.

Another advantage in not using cars is everyone getting active. Instead of everyone driving everywhere millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses. People are interacting with each other. Many people have said that it has released stress and lowered air population. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network to save time, conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety.

"Positive attitude and humility are two important traits that can greatly impact an individual's success in life. While there are many factors that contribute to success, having a positive attitude and being humble are crucial. These traits not only help individuals achieve their goals, but also help them navigate through difficult times and overcome obstacles.

Having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success in life. A positive attitude allows individuals to focus on the positive aspects of a situation, rather than dwelling on the negative. This mindset can help individuals overcome challenges and find opportunities where others may see only obstacles. For example, a student who is struggling in a particular subject may have a negative attitude towards the subject and give up on it. However, if the student has a positive attitude, they may continue to work hard and find a way to understand the subject, leading to success in that area.

Humility is also a key factor in achieving success in life. Being humble allows individuals to recognize their strengths and weaknesses and work on improving themselves. It also allows individuals to learn from others and accept constructive criticism. For example, a successful business owner may be humble and open to feedback from their employees, leading to a more successful business.

It's also important to never give up on pursuing your dreams. Many successful individuals have faced setbacks and obstacles in their journey to success, but they never gave up. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced numerous rejections from publishers before finally finding one that was willing to take a chance on her. However, she never gave up on her dream and continued to work on the series, eventually leading to its success.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude and being humble are two important traits that can greatly impact an individual's success in life. These traits not only help individuals achieve their goals, but also help them navigate through difficult times and overcome obstacles. Additionally, never giving up on pursuing your dreams is crucial for achieving success in life. Real-life examples such as J.K. Rowling's journey to success demonstrate the importance of these traits and the impact they can have on an individual's success.",1,161
"The ways we know that the face is just a natural landform and not something created by Aliens is because we have done real research on the Landform.

Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. So we know that the planet is changing and that's how we know that the landform isn't created by Aliens.

"People make many facial expressions to tell how they are feeling about certain people or situations. There really a need for a software to detect how a student emotional expressions are? Classrooms do not need technology for student to tell what their emotional expressions are. Students peers are more than capable of telling weather the person likes something or not. It's also a waste of technology to be put in a classroom.

One reason why technology to read students is not beneficial is facial expressions can be seen and dozen'r have to be heard. In the passage paragraph four it states that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal and individuals often show varying degrees of expressions."" Another reason is humans are the detectors of weather another persons like something or not. In paragraph five it states that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Why need technology when people have their own knowledge of what's going on with a person. Last reason is using your muscles called palpabraeus, in paragraph eight it explains that using your muscles you can spot certain faces a person is trying to make. It says, ""To an expert faces don't lie; these muscles clues are used to spot when a smile politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In conclusion using technology is not a good use to read student in a classroom. There is no reason because there are people when it can detect other people's expressions. Students also using their own resources/knowledge. In the passage it states that, ""moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may help produce them."" No need technology to tell a person that. ",0,163
"Dear State Senator,

I think we should keep the Electoral College. It's been with us for a very long time, passed down from our founding fathers. They establish the Electoral College in the Constitution for a reason. There is no need for us to get rid of it. It's been helping us choose the right president for this country for decades. Sure the popular vote is important too, but I think the Electoral College is more helpful and here is why.

The electoral votes know more about who and what they are voting for. Because they pay more attention to the campaign than the people. It also helps with close or an even amount of the popular votes, so it could break the tie even though it is unlikely we can always have the Electoral College to decide. Sometimes when people vote they don't even know who to vote for and could just check the box they see a name for. They don't know what the elective could do for the future of America. Some also vote for certain electives because someone told them too or because someone else voted for that elective. Some candidates go and try to win increase his or her plurality and persuade the people of certain states that they know they'll win to become president instead of trying to get all the states too vote for him or her. Which won't be that successful of a president as stated in paragraph 19. Candidates focus their campaign on the toss-up states because they know what they are voting for. Which awards electoral votes to the candidate. Popular votes help by letting the candidate get more electoral votes because of the winner take all basis as said in paragraph 18.

That is why I think we should keep the Electoral College. It helps out with a lot of things. It has helped us for many years and have give us great presidents for America. Furthermore, it makes the method of choosing a president easier too. Hopefully the Electoral College will stay with America for a long time.",0,164
"Students who take an online classis do not have many benefits because, they feel lazy to study on their own, sometimes do not their assignments and also do not have people they will be competed with. They also do not have much confident to speak with lots of people or give a speech in front of many people, which makes someone who attends an everyday class with a lot of people to be experienced than a person who takes an online class. People with much experience in a lot of things do not always have fake people in their lives.

People always think that taking an online class is very good, which is totally wrong. When taking online classes you do not get to know the people who are performing much better than you in class, but when you go to an everyday class in a school, you know the people who are better than you in different subjects. When you take an online class you do not get people who will help you solve your problems in many courses; for example, when you take an online class, and you fail in a subject you would not know those who performed good in that subject, that means that you will not know how to study hard to perform good next time. Online students always find it difficult to study because, they do not see their mates in school learning which will also encourage them to that same thing. This means that taking an online class will not be advisable for students.

Also, when taking an online class, you do not get to interact with different kind of people throughout the world. People who take an online class do not always have the confident to speak in public and do not always have the lot of friends. Having friends is one of the important things in our life. When you have friends you share each other's problems and solve it together. This means that when you take an online class you do not always have enough friends to speak to or to share your problems with. For instance, when you are given the opportunity to give a speech in front of a lot of people, you begin to shiver or start stammering because you are not use to speaking in public. But when a person who attends classes which involves a lot of individuals, they always have the confident not to only speak in front of their mates but to also speak to those who are much older than them without any fears.

Moreover, people who always involve themselves in a video conference do not always know the people their dealing with in their business or do not always have much idea about their business meeting. When one is present at work place all the time, he or she runs the business smoothly without any misunderstanding with anybody. Again when having a business with someone on a video conference, you do not know if the person you are dealing with is a fraud or not. So people who do an online business always end up putting themselves into trouble. When one is always present at their business places, they always know the people who are hardworking and can make the business go much further and those who are lazy. When you are always at your work place, you make your members to respect and adopt your policies.

People who take online classes do not understand much better because, the teacher is not always around them when they need help with the topic that they not understand. But hen you are in an everyday school classes, when a teacher always teach, and you do not understand you always know where to locate him to ask for help. Even when the teacher is not around, you can find different teachers who also teaches that subject, and they will always find a solution to your problem. So students who attend an everyday classis perform much better than those who take an online class.

All the above-mentioned, which includes, it makes them interact with different people, find a lot of friends, get to know good people in a business, ask teachers for help when they have a problem really shows that taking an online class or a video conference is not really beneficial for an individual. Once all these measures are taken into consideration, people will see that going to an everyday class or making yourself present at a business meeting is more important to a person.",0,165
"I am usually a bit skeptical about new technologies like the Facial Action Coding System, but I am opened to the idea of new technology. In this case I support the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. It is pretty interesting how the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can determine the emotion someone is feeling by examining the muscle movements in the face. The FACS could be a very useful tool in many ways in the near future.

The FACS uses facial moments to determine whether a person is feeling happy, sad, surprised, angry, disgusted, fearful, or sad. The interesting thing about the FACS is that it can determine whether the person is faking an emotion. For example, the article stated,"" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygotic major and a different muscle, the rigorous"". So by examining muscle movements in the face, the FACS can determine whether the person is faking an emotion or actually feeling it. In the future I think therapist could use the FACS to help determine how his/her patent is actually feeling. Dr. Huang stated,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". I think that this would be an effective way to father advance education in our society.

In conclusion, I agree with the use of the Facial Action Coding System. I believe it will help us advance as a society and make things less difficult. I feel as if the technology could be used in many ways besides schools. Many professions, such as psychologist could use this technology.",0,166
"Cell phones are a big issue while driving. Lots of accidents have happened in the past because of people being on their cell phones while driving. The main people that do text or play on their phones while driving are teenagers. There are many ways of solving this problem, but I am only going to be talking about one way to solve it.

One way that we can solve this problem is we can put blue tooth radios in our cars so that if someone calls you there would be a way to answer your phone without picking it up. Most of the newer cars have a Bluetooth radio in them, so you don't have to buy one. Although older model cars don't have them you can buy them and install them. Over half of the accidents in the US happen because of people being or checking their phones.

Although it is never okay to use your phone while driving I think that if you solved that problem by getting a radio. If you have a Bluetooth radio, then there should be less of a chance of you getting in an accident because you would be on your phone less. Even though that is a solution you should still never touch you phone while operating a vehicle.  ",0,167
"Dear Principal,

In my opinion, student should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. Students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch and free times because it can help them communicate with their parents and other peers.

Students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch because it could help them find their friends on the large school campus. Sometimes, when you don't know what class your friend has before lunch it is hard to finds them, and by having a cell phone you can call them and find them easily. Also, during lunch some students would want to call their parents to ask if they are bringing them a lunch, or if they should buy a school lunch. Students may also want to ask their parents if they can go to a friends house after school, and so they will not need to pick them up.

Having a cell phone would also help communication between students and friends from other schools, and between students and friends who are elsewhere on the campus. Students could call their friends to get help on homework or other school projects, or to plan what they are doing after school. Another reason why students should be able to have their cell phones on during free periods in school is because some students, if allowed, leave the campus to eat lunch, and their peers may be wondering where they are, when they are coming back, or to alert them that class has already started.

By not letting students have their cell phones in school, they would be unable to communicate with their parents or peers. The school staff may be worried that students may use their cell phones during class, but if students are allowed to use them in their free times they most likely will not use them while they are learning. Teachers are afraid that students secretly use their cell phones during class, and that it takes away from their education. However, if a student is caught using their cell phone during learning time they know it could be confiscated for the rest of the day.

Many students use their phones after school to contact their parents, friends, or carpool. Many times parents are late to pick their kids up, and if the kids have their cell phones they can call them to make sure they remember where they are. Students also use their cell phones after school to call their friends and ask if they want to hang out or go somewhere now that school ended.

In conclusion, students should be able to bring phones to school and only use them during lunch or other free periods, because it makes communicating easier. As long as cell phones are turned off and not used in class, they will not be a disturbance to the students learning and education.

Sincerely,

"Doesw the electoral college work?

Yes the electoral college works cause it helps people get into a college that they would like to get into or want to it can make them happy and then later on in life they can make better choices to live free and get god jobs and have nice apartment and other things of that sort much it is for the.

''under the electoral college systems voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in Texas for instance and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry on the off chance that those electors won the statewide.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the accident who receives the most popular votes the winner the advocates of this potion.

A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but It's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reasons is that the winning candidates share of the electoral invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote in election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.

Cause most of the states award electoral votes on a winner take basis even a very slight plurality in a state landslide victory in that state a tie in the national nationwide vote is possible cause then total number of votes 538 is an even number but is highly likely.  ",0,169
"The Face on Mars was created by natural landforms, and it is impossible to have been created by aliens. First, there was no sign of alien interaction on Mars when the Face appeared.

The Face couldn't have been formed by alien life.

One reason that proves that the Face is natural is that there has never been any alien interaction evidence on any planet. First, it is not possible for aliens to create a face in cement rock. Next, aliens wouldn't know what a face would look like because they wouldn't have a mirror, and they wouldn't even know what they look like. Finally, if aliens were able to move rock, they wouldn't have any tools to use. Aliens couldn't have formed the Face if we don't even know if they exist.

Another reason that the Face is natural is that it has been proven that the Face was created by a butte or mesa landform. First, these landforms are very common in the American West. Next, Garvin knows that they are common because he mentioned,""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Garvin also said that the Middle Butte landform is the same height as the Face on Mars. If the Face is similar to another landform, it is most likely a natural landform.

The final reason that the Face is natural is that the first picture that was taken, isn't as clear as the newer picture. First, when the original picture was taken, it was very cloudy and difficult to see during the winter in April. This could have been mistaken for alien markings because the sight wasn't easy to see. Finally, the newer picture that was taken had a digital image 3 times bigger than the original pixel in the first photo. The newer photo proves that aliens were not around at all.

In conclusion, many people may have thought the Face was formed by aliens, but they only thought that because of the evidence they were given. The original photo was not clear, so the newer photo shows what it really looked like. The Face also had similar features to mesa and butte landforms which are very common in many areas. Since there was no evidence to show that aliens were there, it's not reliable to believe. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform that formed suddenly, and it can happen anywhere.",0,170
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a strong argument for why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers it presents. The author provides several reasons why exploring Venus is important, and I agree with them.

Firstly, the author points out that Venus is Earth's closest neighbor and is similar in size and mass to our planet. This makes Venus a unique and important planet to study, as it can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The author also notes that Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. This extreme environment makes Venus an ideal place to study the effects of climate change and how it could impact Earth in the future.

Secondly, the author highlights the potential benefits of studying Venus. The author states that Venus has abundant resources, such as metals and minerals, that could be used in the future. Additionally, the author notes that studying Venus could lead to the development of new technologies, such as advanced propulsion systems and life support systems. These technologies could be used in future space missions, making it easier and safer for humans to explore space.

Finally, the author acknowledges the dangers of exploring Venus, such as the extreme heat and crushing pressure. However, the author also notes that these challenges can be overcome with the right technology and planning. The author suggests that NASA's Glenn Research Center is already working on developing new technologies that could be used to explore Venus, such as a new type of spacesuit that can withstand the extreme conditions.

In conclusion, the author provides strong evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author highlights the unique features of Venus, the potential benefits of studying it, and the ways in which the challenges of exploring it can be overcome. I agree with the author that exploring Venus is an important and worthwhile endeavor, and I believe that it could lead to valuable discoveries and advancements in space exploration.",1,171
"Okay, here is my essay:

Ugh, I know this is going to be soon annoying. But, like, I have to write about why older kids shouldn't be paired with younger kids. And honestly, I don't really want to. I mean, I know it's important and all, but it's just so... basic. But, like, here I am. So, here goes nothing.

So, first, it's just really dangerous for younger kids to be paired with older kids. Like, think about it. Older kids are bigger and stronger, and they can totally hurt younger kids if they want to. And, like, what if the older kid is, like, a jerk? They could totally bully the younger kid and no one would even know. It's just not safe.

And, like, even if the older kid isn't mean, they could still be a bad example for the younger kid. Like, if the older kid is, like, super lazy and never does their homework, the younger kid might start to think it's okay to not do their homework too. And then they'll get bad grades and stuff. Or, like, if the older kid is always on their phone and never pays attention to anything, the younger kid might start to think it's okay to be on their phone all the time too. And then they'll, like, miss out on all the fun stuff.

And, like, one time at recess, I saw this older kid picking on a younger kid. Like, he was, like, pushing him around and stuff. And the younger kid was, like, crying and stuff. It was so sad. And I was, like, totally mad at the older kid. Why would he do that? He's supposed to be, like, a role model for the younger kids. But instead, he's just a jerk.

So, like, older kids should totally respect younger kids and not be paired with them. It's just, like, the right thing to do. And if they don't, they could end up hurting someone or setting a bad example. And, like, who wants that? Not me, that's",1,172
"Sure, here is an essay arguing against the idea of a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day, written as if it were a class assignment by an average 8th grade student:

I think we should not have a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. I know some people think it would be good because it would give us more time to learn and do things we like, but I don't think it's a good idea.

First, having two extra hours of school each day would be really hard for me and my friends. We would have to wake up early and stay up late, and it would be hard to keep up with our homework and other things we have to do. Plus, we would have to find something to do with all that extra time, and I don't know what we would do.

Second, I think it would be unfair to some students. Some kids have a lot of responsibilities at home, like taking care of little siblings or helping out with the family business. They wouldn't be able to do that if they had to go to school for two extra hours each day. And some kids don't have as much free time as other kids, so they might not be able to do extra things they want to do.

Third, I don't think we would learn as much if we had a four-day school week. We would have to cram all our learning into those extra two hours, and that would be hard. Plus, we might not be able to focus as well because we would be so tired from having to go to school for longer.

Finally, I think it would be bad for our social lives. We would have to spend more time at school, which would mean we would see our friends less. And we wouldn't have as much time to hang out with them outside of school.

In conclusion, I think having a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day is not a good idea. It would be hard for some students, unfair, and bad for our learning and social lives. I think we should stick with the five-day school week and make the most of our time there.",1,173
"Disgusting pollution in the air! Terrible, but also deadly for our atmosphere, animals, and of course ourselves. As seen in paragraph 17, car emissions aren't only destroying our environment, but are also polluting our air to the point where Paris was covered for days in complete smog. That is why biking, walking, running, conservative driving, etc. are very needed in these days when everyone believes gas powered vehicles are our way of life. While people drive in cars constantly it creates more carbon emissions destroying our air and environment, but on the other hand more biking causes less traffic build up, healthier, and more businesses open up in walking distance because of the magnitude of participants walking/biking.

To begin with, driving in cars isn't only extremely dangerous, it pollutes the air we all breathe! It makes our lungs become weaker and susceptible to disease and sickness. People may argue that giving up our most widely used transportation vehicle in the U.S. and very profitable vehicle industries, is too much. But I argue, that giving up something that will later in time completely destroy us and our earth is worth it. Pollution is a very serious problem that most people can't seem to wrap their head around. It's a deadly chemicals and waste being put into our air we breathe every second, yet we chose our vehicles over our precious air?!

Next, understanding what more walking and less vehicular transportation can do for the world has amazing effects. Not only is it a healthy alternative to walk instead of driving because of our obesity issue here in America, but it cuts out pollution which hurts us and animals. More walking will create less traffic and more businesses and restaurants in walking distance, causing a better community and economy.

In conclusion, more walking and biking is a much better alternative to driving cars constantly. Communities come together more, less traffic, more safety, no road rage, etc. These are all things that could come from walking instead of driving in vehicles.  ",0,174
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our society. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to separate suburban life from auto use, known as ""smart planning."" This movement acknowledges that automobiles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage, we can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

One successful example of limiting car usage is the German suburb of Vauban. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, making the streets completely ""car-free"" except for the main thoroughfare with a tram to downtown Freiburg (Rosenthal, 2009). As a result of this car-free lifestyle, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (Rosenthal, 2009). The residents of Vauban have experienced the benefits of limiting car usage firsthand. They report feeling less stressed and happier without the constant reliance on cars (Rosenthal, 2009). This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life for individuals.

The benefits of limiting car usage are not limited to individual well-being. By reducing car dependency, we can also make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. Smart planning focuses on placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of distant malls accessed by highways (Rosenthal, 2009). This makes it easier for residents to rely on public transportation and encourages walking or cycling for short distances. Additionally, limiting car usage can address the issue of smog caused by car emissions. In cities like Paris, driving bans have been enforced during periods of intense smog to reduce air pollution (Duffer, 2014). These bans have seen a significant decrease in congestion and smog levels (Duffer, 2014). 

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have long-term benefits for our environment. A cultural shift towards reducing car ownership and driving has already been observed in the United States. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if it persists, will have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, making it crucial to limit car usage to achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). 

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By focusing on smart planning and reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and combat climate change. The success stories of communities like Vauban in Germany and the car-free day in Bogotá, Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of such measures. It is essential that we prioritize the development of car-reduced communities and encourage the adoption of alternative forms of transportation. The shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for our environment but also for the overall well-being of individuals and communities.",1,175
"There are a few reasons why it's good to not drive your car. One, is that your car emits so many greenhouse gases. And greenhouse gases are band for the environment. Two, is that it promotes the use of bicycles and/or public transportation. Three, you really don't need your car anyway. Those are the reasons why I say that it would be good to limit car usage.

My first reason why I say we should limit car use is because of the greenhouse gases we are releasing into the air. In article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", paragraph 5, it says, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates."", which means that 50 percent of the greenhouse gases that we release comes from cars.

My second reason why we should limit car us is because if we use cars, we would use something else to get around like a bicycle. And if we use a bicycle we wouldn't be releasing any greenhouse gases."" It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mocks, the city's mayor."" stated in article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"". This is prey much encouraging us to use bicycles instead of cars.

My third and final reason why we should limit our car usage is because we really don't need cars. We only use our cars to get us from place to place, stated article, ""The End of Car Culture"", paragraph 40 which says ""A car just a means of getting from A to B when BART Deon't work."" And why use a car, when you can use public transportation instead.

Now that to know my reasons for limiting car usage, maybe you can try doing it. Limiting our car usage will give us less air pollution and give us a reason to ride our bikes instead of driving our car.",0,176
"School policy

It has come to my attention TEACHER_NAME I understand that you like the students to be very well-educated, and I see that you want them to be the best they can but for some student that is not the case. Some students want to play sports and do good at school, but sometimes they are ineligible to maintain a b average. Most of the time the kids that are playing sports feel that they can't play because they feel that they will not be able to maintain a c average, and they could not play.

Also it has come to my attention that the players that are on a team at the moment seem to be doing fine and need no help to bring their grades up. If you raise the grade average it could not only become a struggling manner for the player but also the league. By raising the average most players may not be eligible to play on the team and with not enough team members to play on the team they will have to shut down the team.

Now I see that your argument is a very valid one and that every kid should stride for perfection but some kids and not only that but also the extracurricular events while maintaining these grades such as soccer, football, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, cheerleading, and hockey. They should stride to be the best at every class and not only that but the sport they are currently active in at the moment.",0,177
"Technology has had a profound impact on people's lives over the past several decades, with increasingly positive effects being felt in economic, educational, and familial aspects of life.

In economic terms, technology has been the backbone of much of the dramatic capacity for wealth generation seen in many countries over the past decades. Technology has played a key role in allowing for the growth of global markets and increased mobility of goods and services through the world, allowing many countries to experience unprecedented economic growth.

Technology has also had a dramatic effect on the educational sector. Digital technologies have increased the capacity to access and disseminate information incredibly quickly, allowing educational institutes to expand their reach further than ever before. Additionally, advances in computer-assisted education have allowed for more efficient and effective teaching and learning, with digital textbooks and interactive lessons playing a major part in modern classrooms.

Finally, technology has deeply impacted the way we interact with family and loved ones. The proliferation of social networking services, video communication, and chat apps have cultivated a world of gadget-enabled communication, often allowing family members to stay in touch who would otherwise be distant. This has made it easier to bridge gaps of geographic distance, playing an important role in a world without physical borders.

To sum up, technology has had a massive positive impact on people's lives, changing the economic, educational, and familial landscapes in ways that were once unimaginable. With the continuing advancement of technology, it is likely these effects will become even more pronounced in the years to come.",1,178
"The technology I don't think will be able to read the expressions from the people in my classroom because i don't that there is such a technology like this because it sounds almost impossible to ever make something like this because it was back then and back then there was not anything like this or even until this day there is nothing like it

Then if there was ever something like this technology i don't think it will work very well considering that every one is in school and mostly when anybody is in school they are usually bummed out about being in school and I think the machine will read mixed emotions and the computer or the device will read everyone's emotions wrongs because like they say ID in the first paragraph how she had mixed emotions I think that that is pretty crazy to have for just one person because

I DNT think just one person can ever have that many emotions even if was a cartoon or a painting

Lastly i don't think that everybody in my school will allow the emotion reader decide there emotions because like me, I will not feel comfortable with one of those readers lie many other people in my classroom will be comfortable with that reader to decade or find out there emotions because the reader might get the wrong emotion and people might start making fun of other peoples emotions and there might be a big argument with the reader and somebody might get mad because that is not how they are feeling and people might get mad because the reader might say something about somebody's business and people might get embarrassed about what other people might think about the hidden emotions.",0,179
"I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for example

They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers

They can teach how to welcome people

It also helps them to have a great future

The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It can also be a great hobby for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example

Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor

Help an old person cross the road

Teach kids how to write neatly

This kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example

United Kingdom

Norway

Sweden

Denmark

Canada

And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job, so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others, and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future, and they can also help their families and other families.",0,180
"Dear Principle, 2/4/11

This world is turning into a darker place. The problem is that people don't care enough. We see homeless people on the side of the street and no one stops their cars. We tend to ignore what is bad. Out of sight out of mind. I think that is ridiculous. We need to help others. If we don't then who will? All students should participate in some form of community service.

Lucky for us, we live in a pretty good town compared to others. In Africa people are starving and here people are dieting. Everything can improve though. We still have poverty. If we help those around us, we will make a ripple affect and can help the world. Ann Arbor has a lot of good opportunities to help our community. Food Gathers is a great program that I have worked with many times. They take food that is being thrown away and sort out the good or bad. Then with that food they make meals and feed the hungry. I think we could get groups of student to help out there sometimes. It could be a fun field trip that also teaches valuable lessons. Many organizations like this are beginning to pop up. We all need to help though. One person can create a ripple, but a group can create a wave.

Another growing problem we have is laziness. I'll admit I'm lazy sometimes too. When students say it's a waste of time to help those less fortunate we have a problem. You don't need to spend hours but only a minute to help someone out. If someone is so busy with school work and extracurricular activities then they can go online and donate money, even just a dollar. Everyone can help they just need to know how and be motivated.

When you help someone else you don't just help them, you help yourself. Helping those less fortunate is a humbling experience. You learn how to be a better person, and you want to try harder in life. I once worked at a soup kitchen. I saw kids just like me with parents just like mine, and they were starving. Furthermore, I am lucky, and I learned just how fortunate I was there. Furthermore, I know that if some 'bad' kids went, they would appreciate what they have and be a better student. School isn't just about math and writing its about preparing you for life. An experience like this would defiantly teach you a life lesson.

Community service helps everyone. We can make an impact in our world by starting with just you and me. We need to motivate people to help, convince them that if they don't know one will. I strongly think that all student should require to perform community service. At least an hour of our time every month. Thank you for your time.

"Driverless cars are the future of the automotive industry such as car on were. Driverless cars can help out in the future such as if a person is intoxicated, or falls asleep while driving the car would prevent an accident. Unlike the leap from the horse to the car the driverless car has many variables it has to go through before being released in mass quantity. There will always be problem that will arise, but there will always be someone who can fix the problem. We should be able to own our own driverless cars by the year 2020.

Picture a world with little to no traffic jams, and a world where everyone could sleep on a road trip. This is the world that we could live in if we had driverless cars. Right now this may be unavailable however Google, and many car manufacturers have been working very had to bring this to reality. All the current ""driverless cars"" have INE major problem and that being we need a human to respond to situations that the car cannot.

Google has developed a LIDAR a spinning sensor on the roof of the car which is constantly updating 3-d models of the cars surroundings. They have also made it possible to respond to danger and out-of-control skids or rollovers. With both of these technologies it makes it possible to have a driverless car. We may need a humans help still, but using various methods such as a vibrating seat or income system we can quickly alert the driver that we need them to take over.

Driverless cars are great, but like all great things there are some problems. The biggest problem is if a driverless car gets into a wreck whose problem is it the manufacturer or the driver. Another problem is that many states do not believe driverless cars to be safe, so they have not yet legalized them.

Driverless cars make the future a safer and more glamorous place to live. If everyone could see that these driverless cars are safe we could have this future in a presidential term. I urge you to join soon because the sooner everyone is on board the sooner the future we deserve can arrive.",0,182
"The way of seeing how kids feel in a classroom, this new technology shows it all. Will this change teaching and everything else in the classroom, let's find out.

Professor, Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Professor NICU See of the University of Amsterdam. Are construction a computer with a 3-D computer model of the face; it uses all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, this is called an ""action unit"".

I support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in classrooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are happy about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn't have this type technology. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technology in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have postponed the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed a lot of confusion over the section. That could have saved a lot of time and get better grades, as they could have not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over an answer if a student or students or confused what is going.

There are 6 different basic emotions in the system, happiness, surprise, anger,digest, fear and sadness. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

In fact, we humans preform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. We can tell when a friend is happy, or upset, due to how much we around them. It's that this 3-D facial computer system can even tell more when you can't.

If we had this in a classroom, this would help so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more places. Such as Jails, Conceding areas, Therapists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie sector, shows the emotions. Say they can't get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of a lot things in everyday life. This could also mean that, school corporations might receive rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really help out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don't have some of the newest technology as some other schools due, and why because I go to a small school, so we don't receive high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why I agree we should have this newest technology and a lot of the schools, to succeed in life and to help kids get better.",0,183

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. In the paragraph below I will be explaining why I believe the technology presented in this article would be valuable by reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

First, I believe that the use of this technology is valuable to be used for reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because like the article states it could, if used correctly, determine when a student is becoming ""confused or bored"". This could lead to modified lessons that engage and more effectively teach students the material without the need for so much individual attention from the teacher.

Also, connecting to my last statement this technology may not only aid in the students learning but also provide help to teachers. This is because with technology that can read the students emotions and possibly adapt lessons to the individual the teacher in the room won't have to worry about giving all the students their own individual attention to help them most effectively learn the same material with only a small amount of time to do it. This technology would almost be like having a dozen or so assistant teachers in the room leaving more time for the real teacher to attend to things like making lesson plans and grading.

Last but not least I feel that this technology would be useful in the classroom is because if a child was sad, hurting, depressed, or any other negative emotion and the student was hiding all that through a smile the technology may be able to help see behind the smile so that teachers or therapists can better help students through their problems and understand them better without spending so much time reading a children confusing signals.

In conclusion, I believe that the Facial Action Coding System can be a valuable tool in the classroom for a variety of reasons including but not limited to the reasons I described in the above paragraphs.",0,185
"Have you ever ask yourself why do some people are always are their home never go out to socialize with others? Since technology appear in the world, the life of millions of people got an easier way to live, because it brought most of the things and supplies that we need to make our life better and easier.

In my opinion I think technology has positive effect in people's live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school.

Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you don't need to be face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who don't have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans can't do.

However, technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console, they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it too much but it's not the fault of technology it's our own responsibility to take care of our health.

Technology affects peoples life by reducing their contact with others but at the same time it brings a lot of benefits to our generation and the future.",0,186
"Dear Principal,

I think that your first policy is a very good idea, and you should go with that idea. Your second policy would just make the students very angry and make them start hating you, and I'm pretty sure you don't want your students to hate you. I think that it is important for you to chose your first policy because if students didn't bring a cell phone to class, and they missed the bus they would have no way of calling their parents to come pick them up and about 90% of the students don't like to go in the office and call their parents they would rather use their cell phone, another reason why your first policy is good is because your students won't hate you, and they will have their phone, but they will have it turned off in class and be more focused on what the teacher is teaching, and also if you took away cell phones you would have a lot of students who hate you and refuse to pay attention in class.

Missing the bus is a very average thing, at least five people a day miss the bus every day and most of those people who miss the bus don't like to go in the office and call from that phone because they are either scared you will get mad at them for missing the bus or that there will be another person there that will think them stupid for missing the bus. Most students don't have perfect grades and so some stay after school and miss their bus and calling their parents from their cell phone is a very casual thing because as soon as they get done with what they were doing in that class they can call their parents to pick them up, so they get home faster. Students also like to call their parents from their cell phones to see if they can go to their friends house and that's just a faster way of calling instead of going to the office and waiting because then the friend and the person have just missed their bus. So keep the cell phones and you won't have to worry bout anyone missing their bus or too scared to come in and call from the office phone.

Your first policy states that we can have our cell phones if we only use it during lunch or our free time which is a great idea because then you will have your students focused during class and trying to have fun in that class so that they have the time fly buy and be able to text during their free time. If you take away our phones because you got us texting class, that is ok because that is totally fair because we shouldn't have ever been texting in class in the first place. So let us keep our phones, and we promise not to text in class and pay attention and to only text during our free time.

Taking away our cell phones like is says to do in your second policy is a very bad idea because you will have 100% of the students hating you and a principal that has all of its students that hates them makes the school go into chaos. What I mean by that is that none of the teachers will have students willing to participate and do their work which means a lot of kids failing just because you decided to take away cell phones from the school, and I'm pretty sure you don't want to run a school with a bunch of failing kids and more to come if you take away our cell phones.

So stick with your first policy and keep cell phones, and we promise not to text during class and only during our free time. Going with your second policy would be a terrible thing because then you would have a bunch of students not will to participate and not having a ride home because they missed the bus and not to mention every student will hate you. So make the smart choice and keep a war off of your hands and go with your first policy.  ",0,187
"Working with a group on school assignments can be beneficial for students, as it can help them learn new skills, find solutions to problems, and break down complicated concepts. On the other hand, working alone can have its own advantages, such as allowing students to work at their own pace and ensuring that they get full credit for their work. 

Ultimately, both approaches have their pros and cons, and students should decide which approach works best for them. In particular, working with a group can be a great choice for students because it allows for collaboration and shared responsibility among team members. Not only can this make the project more manageable and enjoyable, but it can also help foster teamwork and problem-solving skills essential for success in the future. Moreover, working with a group can also give students access to a greater range of perspectives, allowing each member to learn from one another’s ideas and abilities. For these reasons, students should consider voting to work in a group on school assignments.",1,188
"Summer projects are one of the most common forms of ensuring that students continue learning during their long summer break. These projects allow students to keep the information and experience that they learned through their school year throughout the summer. However, though the purpose and need of the summer projects may be valid, they are not interesting and motivating projects for students to complete, and, as such, students tend to procrastinate in completing their projects and learn less from the project thereby defeating its very purpose. The result of such a summer project, is the loss of knowledge gained by students in the past year, bad grades at the start of the new school year, and the unpreparedness of the students to return to school in a higher level class. Due to the fact that teachers are adults who prioritize the implement of knowledge into students, they are, at times, unable to make the summer projects they assign motivating to the students thereby resulting in this kind of summer projects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will prevent the procrastination of students on the projects, allow students to absorb more from the project itself, and make the summer project more appealing for the students to complete.

One of the most important reasons why summer projects must be designed by students is to prevent the procrastination of students in the completion of said project. Due to the fact that summer projects tend to be rigorous and tiring, students tend to avoid completing the project until the very last second, which can result in a poor project, the students being unable to recall the learnings of their past year, and even causing them to be unprepared for the challenges of a higher level course. However, if the summer projects were student-designed, they would make it interesting for other students while including the necessary content under teacher supervision. By doing so, students who have to complete the assignment would be more motivated and interested in completing the summer project and would, therefore, not wait till the last second. Due to the last minute efforts by the students, students may feel the need to copy another person's summer project in order to simply make the deadline that they had forgotten about. This cheating would only lead to the students learning nothing from the project, being unprepared for their new higher level class, and learning to cheat on school work. To mitigate or prevent that situation, summer projects should be student-designed, so students would avoid their procrastination all together. Summer projects should be student-designed in order to prevent the procrastination of students thereby allowing them to fulfill the purpose of their summer project.

Though preventing the procrastination of students on the project is indeed one of the greatest benefits of having summer projects being student-designed, another key benefit of this is for it to allow students to absorb and learn more from the project. Due to the fact that summer projects can be tiring and complicated, students tend to absorb little from their completion besides what they must already know. This leads to students being unprepared for their new classes and also deprived of knowledge that was just before their eyes. By having student-designed summer projects, which will be more appealing to the students, students will try harder and be more invested in their projects, therefore allowing them to gain more from their projects than what they normally would. On normal summer projects, students tend to fill out the project without actually understanding what they're doing. By having student-designed summer projects, students are more interested in the project and due to that fact, they are more likely to understand more about the concepts behind the project itself. Summer projects should be designed by students in that it will allow students to learn more from the summer projects than what they normally would.

Preventing the procrastination of students in the summer and allowing them to learn more from the summer projects are both important benefits of having student-designed summer projects, however, none of those benefits would even be possible without the fact that student-designed summer projects are much more invigorating to complete than a normal summer project to a student. Students have the unique advantage of understanding what students like and dislike which gives them an enormous advantage when it comes to creating a summer project for other students. This advantage is why more students will be interested in completing their summer projects which lead to them not procrastinating and absorbing more knowledge from the project. Student-designed summer projects will be naturally be more appealing to students because it would be designed to inspire their interests and therefore their concentration and focus.

Summer projects are a way for students to learn and develop even in the summer when there is no school for them to attend. Therefore, these projects are an important part of a student's school year because their purpose is to allow students to keep the information and experience that they have learned through their school year throughout the summer and to prepare them for their next year. However, even though these projects are needed and are useful to many students, are they currently effective in achieving their purpose? In order to achieve their purpose of cultivating students, summer projects should be student-designed because by having students design the projects, it can prevent student procrastination on these projects, allow students to gain more knowledge and understanding from these projects, and also motivate students to complete these projects. By appealing to student's interests and creativity, allowing students to learn more, and preventing their procrastination; to help future students, summer projects should be student-designed.",0,189
"Dear Principal,

I believe you should ban cell phones at school. There is no logical need for them, other than giving your buddy a quick answer on a difficult test or texting a false rumor to your friend. Cell phones on campus may give students an easy way to contact their parent/guardian in case of an emergency, which is a definite pro, but it also brings in a whole load of cons that I believe outweigh this small pro by a long-shot.

Allowing students to bring phones, but not allowing them to use them during class is somewhat a dumb idea. The temptation would be right there for them, literally in the palm of their hand. It would be quite simple to give an answer to a friend who happens to be struggling on a certain test. I am quite certain that choosing that policy will result in multiple incidents in where students will have their cell phones taken away, possibly for good.

Rumors are not a very kind thing. They can hurt someone, or might even be false, which could hurt somebody even more. Text messaging is used now by our generation more and more. It is now even being used more than phone calls. Allowing phones on campus just perpetuates the idea of spreading rumors. It would be simple and easy to just text message the latest rumor to your friend, who in turn might spread this juicy gossip to his or her other friends. Soon the rumor has spread all throughout the campus, most likely garbled and distorted into something completely different, possibly even false. If a student just has to tell something to another student, can't they just talk to them in person? Might it be somewhat easier to just catch your friend in the hall and speak to them? This way students would not be able to spread these dark rumors around, without looking conspicuous, that is.

Having a policy like, so I believe will better the school greatly. The campus will be more friendly, more open, and more civilized than other campuses who use cell phones.

Please take all of these suggestions into serious consideration.

Yours truly,

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the cost of owning and operating a car, and the health risks associated with driving.

One of the most important reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars produce a significant amount of pollution, including greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Cars also produce air pollutants, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. In addition, the construction and maintenance of roads and highways requires the use of non-renewable resources, such as oil and concrete.

Another reason to limit car usage is the cost of owning and operating a car. Cars are expensive to purchase, insure, and maintain. They also require parking, which can be costly in urban areas. In addition, the cost of gasoline has been rising steadily in recent years.

Finally, there are health risks associated with driving. Drivers are at risk of accidents, which can result in serious injuries or death. Drivers are also exposed to air pollutants, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.

There are a number of things that can be done to limit car usage. One option is to walk or bike instead of driving. This is a healthy and environmentally friendly way to get around. Another option is to take public transportation. This is a convenient and affordable way to travel, and it helps to reduce traffic congestion. Finally, it is possible to carpool or use ride-sharing services. This can help to reduce the number of cars on the road and save money on gas.

Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can reduce pollution, save money, and improve health. It can also make communities more livable by reducing traffic congestion and providing more space for people to walk, bike, and socialize. If we all make an effort to limit car usage, we can make a big difference for the environment and our own health.

In conclusion, there are a number of reasons to limit car usage. Car usage has a negative impact on the environment, it is expensive, and it can be dangerous. There are a number of things that we can do to limit car usage, such as walking, biking, taking public transportation, carpooling, or using ride-sharing services. Limiting car usage has a number of benefits, including reducing pollution, saving money, and improving health. If we all make an effort to limit car usage, we can make a big difference for the environment and our own health.",1,191
"There are many reasons why older people enjoy life more than young people. One reason is that young people are still developing and are still learning about the world around them. They are also still learning about themselves and how to find their place in the world. Older people are more experienced and can provide a more complete view of the world. They can also provide support to young people as they grow and learn.

Another reason why older people enjoy life more is that they have had more experience in the world. They have been through more life experiences and can provide a more complete view of the world. They can also provide support to young people as they grow and learn. Older people also have more memories to share with others. They can share memories of their childhood, their family, their friends, or their life in general. This can provide a more complete view of the world for others.

"In the article ""driverless cars are coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. I think that there should be driverless cars in the future. The idea of driverless cars is great, and can help save many lives.

Right now without driverless cars there are becoming way to many accidents. More and more people are getting tickets by speeding and or texting while driving. With driverless cars, their will be a lot less accidents when texting. Also since the car is driving for you, it will go the right speed limit. Driverless cars still need some work, but in a couple of years it will be fixed. Each generation is becoming smarter and smarter. So if we have started to make the hard part of the driverless car, imagine what we will be able to do in a couple of years! Driverless cars can also help with traffic. Driverless cars will discover the fastest way possible to get to the drivers' location. The driver will not have to worry about as much. The car takes care of that for them!

Driverless cars can help people from getting injured and making people less stressed. It is a great way for people to get less tickets. It will help the flow of traffic and find the shortest was possible to get to their location. With newer technology these next couple years, we will be able to make the driverless car safe and fun where everybody will love them.",0,193
Dear principal. I think policy #1 is the best policy for the school because us teenagers like to be on the phone to talk to friends or relatives and during lunch all were doing is having free time anyway were talking to are friends and eating so I don't know why it should be a big deal on not letting us use are cell phones at lunchtime and for free time in class you should allow us to use are phones because were just having free time were not learning anything new but during class time are phones should be off like you said because its class time not lunchtime or free time. That's why I think policy 1 is the best thing. But see you teachers can be on the phone at any time you want so that's why I say let us be on are phones at lunch or during free time because we like to talk to are friends cousins if they don't go to the same school we do and all were doing is texting or calling I don't see why that should be a big deal. So once again that's why I say policy 1 is the best policy for the school.,0,194
"Dear, State Senator

I would like to inform you of the elections to the electoral college and the by popular votes, that this is to the fact we should change by the popular votes for the president instead of the Electoral College because under the Electoral college system voters would not be able to vote not for the president but for the slate of electors, the state legislatures are being responsible for picking the electors so the can vote for the people and the college is unfair, outdated,and irrational.

Although being that voters will not be able to vote for the president. The voters may be able to vote but not for the president but for a slat EOF electors, who in turn elect the president. These would go to congress and the vote for the electoral votes this makes it much worse to consider the state legislatures are technically.

The electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast of deciding the site whomever they would like to have it given an amount of voters to vote for one party for the president and another for the congress. They picked more electoral votes responsible for picking the electors could always defy the will of the people.

This is unfair, outdated and irrational because its in favor of mostly assertions without much basic of not letting the people vote instead of the state legislature choosing electors to vote to pick the president.  ",0,195
"State Senator,

The Electoral College is not a fair way to vote. Instead of voting for whom you would like to win, you are voting for an elector who says they will vote for the candidate you want to win. Voting for whom we want is a part of our rights! The Electoral College system is not only out dated, but there have also been a few fiascos.

This style of voting has been going on since the beginning, there are many flaws that need to be worked on. A major problem would be the electors; they are not reliable. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This right here proves that the electors don't always tell the truth. Who picks the electors anyway? ""Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" We don't even get to select our electors, how are we supposed to rely on strangers to vote for whom we would like? Would you trust a random stranger to take care of your child? It is the same as putting the fate of our country in the hands of someone some people have never even seen! ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,"" This information should prove to you that the Electoral College is unfair.

The disaster factor should have been the end to the Electoral College. ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Is there anything left to say? These people tried to sabotage the election. What is stopping more people from this? Some electors refused to vote for whom they said they would. ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" In 1960 Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress! Thanks goodness for Vice President Nixon who ""validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so 'without establishing a precedent.'""

Also, many people stated that they prefer the direct election, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" With giving you this information, you should be able to infer that the Electoral College should be changed.

In conclusion, more people are against the Electoral College than with it. We should be able to vote for which one we prefer. Fewer people would have a problem with the election process, and it would go a lot smoother.

Thank you for your time,

"Owning a vehicle or absence is not what it used to be. Today, people all across the globe have given up driving for the many benefits that come along with alternative methods of transportation. These methods can reduce pollution, be cost-effective, and even improve people's well-being and happiness.

First, there is a surprising amount of options if you don't want to drive a car.

Public transportation such as trains and buses exist in most major cities, especially in America and Europe. San Francisco is a busy city with many young residents, and many of these residents are not interested in getting their licenses. "". . . They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" Because so many options exists, many people don't feel the need to own a car anymore. Similarly, some cities and towns have been made specifically to be navigated by foot, like Vauban Germany. Towns like Vauban are tailored to fit its resident's needs in everyday. "". . . In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" In Vauban, necessities are conveniently placed so that the town's inhabitants may access them with ease, rather than driving around the town.

However, alternative transportation methods are not the only reason to give up your car. By not driving a car, air pollution can be decreased drastically. In Paris, France's largest city and international destination, driving was temporarily illegal because of heavy smog in the city. "". . . Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" It did not take very long for traffic and smog to clear up once the ban was put in place, and the famous city began to look like itself once again.

People are also happier when they do not drive cars. ' ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walter.'  ",0,197
"In today's fast-paced world, young people are often accused of not giving enough time to helping their communities. While it is true that many young people are busy with school, work, and other activities, I believe that they still contribute significantly to their communities. In this essay, I will argue that young people do indeed give enough time to helping their communities, and I will provide several reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, young people are often involved in community service projects and volunteer work. Many high schools and colleges require students to complete a certain number of community service hours in order to graduate. This means that young people are actively seeking out opportunities to help their communities. For example, I have personally volunteered at a local food bank and helped to organize a charity event for a children's hospital. These experiences have taught me the importance of giving back to my community and have inspired me to continue doing so in the future.

Secondly, young people are often at the forefront of social and political movements that aim to improve their communities. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement was largely led by young people who were passionate about addressing systemic racism and police brutality. Similarly, young people have been instrumental in advocating for environmental protections and climate change action. These movements demonstrate that young people are not only willing to give their time, but also their energy and passion, to make a difference in their communities.

Finally, young people are often creative and innovative in their approaches to community service. For example, many young people have started their own non-profit organizations or social enterprises that aim to address specific issues in their communities. These organizations often use social media and other digital platforms to reach a wider audience and engage more people in their work. Additionally, young people are often more willing to experiment with new ideas and approaches to community service, which can lead to more effective and impactful solutions.

In conclusion, while it is true that young people are often busy with school, work, and other activities, I believe that they still give enough time to helping their communities. Young people are often involved in community service projects and volunteer work, at the forefront of social and political movements, and creative and innovative in their approaches to community service. These contributions demonstrate that young people are not only capable of making a difference in their communities, but also willing and eager to do so.

"The idea of a four-day school week has been met with both praise and scrutiny. Proponents argue that it would offer a much-needed reprieve for students, families, and teachers alike. Research suggests that students could benefit from reduced stress brought about by eliminating the school week entirely on Fridays. In addition, parental involvement could increase, as families could use Friday as a day for enrichment activities with their children. 

On the other hand, disadvantages to a four-day school week could include longer school days for students and a more complex schedule for teachers. In addition, student-family relationships could be strained due to longer hours away from home and an increased academic workload. Furthermore, students may find it difficult to maintain their focus for a longer school day or to stay motivated over a longer school week.

The potential effects of a four-day school week should be considered carefully before deciding whether to move forward with such a change. The potential advantages and disadvantages should be thoroughly evaluated to create an equitable outcome that addresses the needs of students, families and teachers alike.",1,199
"So just because i couldn't open the exhibit window am I going to write about what do you I like to do in class. I like to work alone with nobody bother me. sometimes I like to with work with groups but is all depend on what type of people am I working with and also how is my mood during the day of in the class. When am I working like to listen to music because it let me focus what am I doing and i don't get distracted with the others' student talking about drama or what is going on and there life or school. Also, when am in class i don't like when teachers or student start asking me question where I am from or what do I like to do. Or sometimes I like to work when the place is quiet because I can focus more and the place is quiet I can do my work in peaces. Also, I like to have my personal bubble because i don't like when teacher or student come to my face and start asking me about stuff that I do not know or when they give me an attitude so that is the time when the situation will star to get worse because every time when to happen I will do the same to do them but mine it will be worse and sometimes I cannot control myself. When the work in a group I like to work with people that won't talk too much, and we do our own work. Because when I work in group who talk a lot I cannot focus on my work, or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when I get mad or when they're trying to put me in there conversion that I do not care because if I am not talking to you or to the group that mean I am good and I do not need you or i don't need your opinion. I like to be my own personality because I know what I am doing and I am doing because I like it and when people told to stuff or me trying to be a different person just because they don't how I am or that way I dress or look. And I cannot be an other type of person who I am not because I will be lying to myself and lying to the people around me just because I am acting different or look different for other people to think I am like that. Also, if you think we are friends, and you start to get conferees around me, and you start talking about your life I am just going to walk away because i didn't ask you about your life because I am not interested in your life because if I did, i probably would ask you but if i didn't ask that mean i really don't care what do you do or what do you like. If i don't like you, you better understand i won't be nice to you and i won't try to have a conversation with you. Or event class if I am not talking with anyone the mean i don't want y'all to talk to me or if i don't like the teacher I just keep my distance but if the teacher i don't like and she/he come at know where a start yelling at me, i won't stay quiet and I will say stuff back to you because you just come to my face a start yelling at me for no reason so that is telling me that you got a problem with me and i didn't know at about it. It is so ease if you respect me I will respect you back because if you come at mo where a start saying stuff to me and i really don't know what is going on I swear will disrespect you and say a lot of stuff to you because you came to me saying stuff and every time that happen i really don't care if I hurt you or I hurt your feeling. If you leave me alone we probably we be cool and we won't have any issues with each other. Been around people is not my type stuff I like to do i just rather to be alone and do my own stuff but if you need help would ask someone who I think they know just go to the internet and try to found what I need online. Because i don't like to bother people just to do it or try my best to guess in the answer.",0,200
"Changing our school men to much healthier choice's is a good idea because it's good for the students to eat much healthier food in school. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired, and you won't have the energy to do anything. It's better to take away the opinion of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students won't be so tempted to eat it, and could choose a better and healthier choice.

Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. Adding healthier choices in TH school cafeteria men could help them stay in shape. Most students don't work out, so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out because of how the food is made. The school could make a scald bar for those who chose to eat it, and they could add their own toppings, so they could eat something they like instead of throwing it out.

I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and it's healthy for students to eat and enjoy. Most students won't have to get Uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.

"Have people ever wanted to know if seeking out multiple opinions or getting more advice will help them get a better answer?

Well today is that day.

I will be doing research to see if asking for more advice and multiple opinions is better.

In my opinion I think it is.

These are a few reasons I think asking people for more advice can help.

When asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is, it might change peoples ideas for the better, and if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.

Firstly, when asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is.

If people want to see what other choices they can make they can ask others.

Most of the time the person people ask will likely have chosen a different path than another person.

Which means that there is a higher chance of people getting multiple opinions by everyone.

People will most likely have a better choice if they ask more people for help them.

When people ask for more advice it is always better for them.

Out of 10 people that ask for more advice 9 of them will have a better outcome than the people that didn't ask for more than 1 opinion.

When I get a broad look on something I normally have a few better choices that I will make.

Secondly, it might change people ideas for the better.

If people are ever questioning if the choice they are going to make is bad then they should ask for advice.

Because, when people hear advice from somebody else it could change their whole perspective about the choice they were going to make.

When people hear advice or multiple opinions there is a higher percentage of them being more successful than others that don't ask.

Asking for more advice is always helpful because it can help people choose a better job or a better car.

Lastly, if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.

By seeing the outcomes of what they did people can see if the outcome is positive or negative.

If it is positive people should probably take this advice and learn form it to make better divisions or make a good choice.

If the outcome is negative don't take this advice because it might lead people down the wrong path.

If someone finds two people with two good opinions and they don't know what to choose they should choose the one that fits them the best.

If they don't find one that is good for them then they should go with what fits them the best.

When seeking multiple opinions and asking for advice to make better choices people should always make sure they find advice that fits them best.

People should always do this just so they have a better outcome.

These are a few reasons I think asking people for more advice can help.

When asking for advice people get a more broad look at what there is, it might change peoples ideas for the better, and if you get more advice from people, you can see the outcomes of what they did.

People should always have a better outcome when they ask for advice.

There are more ideas on why asking for advice is good but the ones I stated are the best ones.",0,202
"One big thing I want to happen is that the electoral college for voting should be changed for popular vote for the president because I think that if you change it voting would go a lot easier than it do now. Why? Because the electoral college is a more complicated voting matter that people often do and get their votes mixed up, and it takes more effort and time just to vote rather than an easy popular vote that people can measure off a chart or graph to see with person should get elected.

Another thing about the voting process I think i should'd talk about is some possible problems you can come across after this change in the voting process. There's one thing that's possible of happening is that a lot of people might nor agree with changing the voting process because they don't want to learn a new one because they are so used to the one they're already doing. Another one is that people might think things would go worse if someone mad a change because they way the votes are coming in and if you're voting on a behalf of a friend and send the vote to the wrong person and the other person lost by 1 vote when you didn't mean to send that, they should have a computer system that you use that makes sure you really want to vote on that person.

It is another major thing about voting that needs to be discussed. When all these thousands of people vote they vote should actually count not just have people vote and then the only votes that count is the people in some courtroom that have more business people come in to vote and only there's count. But I think people waist a lot of their time with the electoral college because of how it works and the way people send their votes and who the votes actually going to.

The winner of the election is the most important one because he is the main focus now because his votes were more popular of just a lot more than the other person, but that's what I want to talk about. Even though the winner won he still has to pay attention to the other candidates, but they should have a system that protects the winner files and have people haves a good watch on the people who are elected to see what their background life is like their history and what they do every day to make sure that person isn't trying no horrible plan for something.

In life, we all face difficult times. Whether it's a breakup, a failure, or a health issue, these moments can be challenging and overwhelming. However, during these times, it's important to maintain a positive attitude. In this essay, I will explore the effects of having a positive attitude during a difficult time, as well as ways to support a loved one going through a difficult time, and a personal narrative of a loved one who maintained a positive attitude during a difficult time.

Firstly, research shows that having a positive attitude during a difficult time can have a significant impact on an individual's mental and physical health. According to a study by the Mayo Clinic, people who have a positive attitude tend to have better overall health and are less likely to experience chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Additionally, having a positive attitude can help individuals cope with stress and anxiety, which can lead to better mental health.

Secondly, there are many ways to support a loved one going through a difficult time. One way is to simply be there for them and listen to their concerns. Another way is to offer practical help, such as running errands or cooking a meal. It's also important to be empathetic and understanding, and to avoid judgment or criticism.

Lastly, I have a personal narrative of a loved one who maintained a positive attitude during a difficult time. My grandmother was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, and it was a very difficult time for our family. Despite the news, my grandmother remained positive and optimistic throughout her treatment. She would often say that she was grateful for the love and support of her family and friends, and that she was going to fight the cancer with all her might. Her positive attitude not only inspired us all, but it also helped her cope with the pain and discomfort of her treatment.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude during a difficult time is important for both our mental and physical health. There are many ways to support a loved one going through a difficult time, including simply being there for them and offering practical help. Finally, maintaining a positive attitude can have a significant impact on the way we approach difficult situations, and can inspire those around us.",1,205
"Unmasking The Face

A lot of people lately have been suspicious of my company NASA. While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The public has all reasons to be suspicious towards the ""Face of Mars!"" Sounds like something from ""The Twilight Zone."" Well, Mars, though so barren, might as well been considered the earth's twin sister... or brother. The two planet's surfaces have shown some interesting similarities, like water remnants and climates. Not to mention volcanoes. This is where we find the reason behind the face of Mars!

On our planet earth, we have land structures called ""Mesas."" These elevated lands are found in the ""American West"", where the surrounding deserts (used to be oceans in theory), are now filled with canyons, rock flats, salt flats, mesas, and other forms only found there. Mars might as well have a northwest region where one could find earthlike similarities. This may as well be the reason behind the face. Also, one should note that the shadows may be rocks making a shadow from the sunlight. Another logical explanation to look at France. Shaped like a boot, it is just a landform that naturally occurred, looking like something we know.

My company would also like to state that this really ""isn't"" a cover-up. In true fact, the discovery of other life or remnants of one such time would be positive to us, and to our projects. So, say what you want. Believe in what you think, but we at NASA believe this isn't alien. Just another similarity between Mars and Earth.",0,206
"Dear, Principal

We students have been hearing stories of you taking away sports unless we have a B average. I personally think it is a plausible idea, it will be a great way to pick up the student's grades and test scores. It also will encourage students into putting effort in their work. It shall help the school look better too.

Furthermore, it is a great idea it will further some students academically it should give students's who need to help more time to focus on their work. The students might study more so that they can pick their scores up to be one of the students playing and not having to worry about grades because they have it in the bag.

It will encourage students to put more effort into their work. If students see that all they need is to push a little more, and they will make it, most of them will. If I was not making good grades by a mere couple points i would just try a little harder to at least say I tried. It is even better when you can say"" I made it"". Students don't like being stuck in classrooms all day, so they will do anything to get out even working. If the only way to get out of class is to work it will be the fastest time you ever so a student strive and put effort in their work.

It will make the school look better. Once your counties superintendent an board of directors gets together and review the school it would get outstanding recognition. That is always good to have.

This is an overall good idea Say you should go For i",0,207
"One's character traits are often strongly influenced by the people we communicate with and the environment in which we live. For example, growing up I had a close friend who was very outgoing and adventurous. Spending time with them often pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take on new challenges. Over time, I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life. 

To illustrate this point, one of my relatives grew up in an environment where she was surrounded by art, music, and books. At a young age her parents exposed her to various forms of creative expression and provided her with the necessary resources and tools to be creative. As a result, she grew up to be very artistic and proficient in multiple instruments. This would have not been the case had she not been exposed to the various forms of art and creativity in her childhood. 

Overall, it is clear that one's character traits are often heavily influenced and formed by the people we communicate with and the environments in which we live. Through careful consideration and exploration of these external factors, a person can cultivate an abundance of positive traits and become their best possible self.",1,208
"Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. For one, it allows you to cover a greater range of topics and to develop a more complete understanding of them. Additionally, by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you can better prepare yourself for any academic situation, whether it is for college or professional purposes.

For example, if you are interested in studying law, you would be better off studying law history, law theory, and law practice. If you are interested in studying music, you would be better off studying music theory, music history, and music practice. By having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, you can better prepare yourself for any academic situation.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey there,

Technology is pretty cool and all, but it's not all rainbows and butterflies. In fact, there are some pretty negative impacts of technology that we should talk about. Now, I know some people might say that technology is awesome and has made our lives way easier, but I'm here to tell you that it's not all good. Here are three main ways' technology has a negative impact on people:

First off, technology can be super distracting. Like, have you seen how many notifications you get on your phone? It's like, every five seconds someone is messaging you or posting something on social media. And don't even get me started on video games. I mean, I love playing Fortnite as much as the next guy, but sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in front of the screen for hours on end. It's like, how are we supposed to focus on our schoolwork or anything else when we're constantly getting notifications? It's like, our brains are just wired to be distracted all the time. And that's not good.

Second, technology can be awful for our health. Like, have you heard of blue light? It's the light that comes from screens, and it's supposed to be awful for your eyes. And it's not just your eyes, either. Studies have shown that using technology for too long can lead to obesity, sleep problems, and even depression. I mean, who wants to be stuck in front of a screen all day? Not me, that's for sure. And it's not just us, either. Our parents and grandparents are probably getting affected by technology too. I mean, have you seen how many older people are on their phones all the time? It's like, they're trying to stay connected with their grandkids, but it's not good for them in the long run.

Lastly, technology can be super addictive. Like, I know I'm guilty of spending way too much time on my phone. And it's not just me. Studies have shown that people can get addicted to technology",1,210
"When people are faced with an important decision, it is wise to seek advice from more than one source. Getting different perspectives allows you to see an issue from multiple angles and take various factors into consideration. While any one person's advice may be limited or biased based on their own experiences, hearing from several people balances out those individual limitations. 

Friends and family members can provide emotional support and understand you personally, but they may be too close to give fully objective advice. On the other hand, strangers you just met will not have preconceived notions about you and can evaluate a situation more impartially. By blending the warmth and closeness of loved ones with the fresh perspective of less involved outsiders, you gain a well-rounded view.  

Different people also have unique backgrounds, areas of expertise, and ways of thinking that allow them to notice or emphasize different aspects of a situation. What one person views as the top priority or constraint may not even occur to someone else. Considering diverse opinions ensures that important variables are not overlooked. For major decisions, it is better to have all the relevant information on the table rather than miss something obvious to others but invisible to our own subjective viewpoints.

In addition, the opinions of multiple people give you a sense of the average or consensus view. An isolated comment that no one else shares is less reliable than an idea independently brought up by several individuals. Patterns and consistencies across many discussions paint a clearer overall picture. With many voices contributing to the dialogue, you end up with a sounder, more-tested conclusion than relying on the advice of just one source.

In closing, seeking multiple opinions allows you to avoid being unduly swayed by any single influence and make choices based on a full understanding of the complex circumstances involved. The wider information net of pooling varied advice leads to wiser decision-making.",1,211
"Participating in Adventure

The Seagoing Cowboys program offered me experiences I will never forget. As a lifelong cowboy from Wyoming, my work routinely involved caring for cattle on the open range. While rewarding, it was also familiar. The opportunity to travel by ship to new destinations and try working livestock on ocean waves was truly unique.  

Getting to visit Australia and handle cattle in the stockyards down under was beyond anything I could have imagined doing as a cowboy. The country was beautiful yet foreign, and interacting with both cattle and people from another culture opened my eyes. I particularly enjoyed conquering the challenge of breaking in horses right on the coast, with crashing waves all around. The adrenaline push of performing familiar, yet risky tasks in such unfamiliar surroundings was exhilarating.

Not only did I broaden my horizons through international travel, but I also learned so much about handling livestock in diverse environments. Cattle have distinct behaviors on land versus floating in pens aboard ships crossing oceans. Gaining that precious knowledge and ability to adapt my skills will surely help me as a cattleman for years to come. The program also allowed me to meet other motivated ""seagoing cowboys"" from all over the US and world, expanding my network in the industry. 

If you treasure adventure, crave fascinating experiences beyond your daily routine, and want to strengthen your skills as an agricultural worker, then I highly recommend participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The memories and lessons I gained will stay with me forever, and I hope sharing my own participation will inspire others to seize this unique chance to ride the waves.",1,212
"Responsible. Technology. Clever. I think students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from their homes. Although, it shows how clever the students are, make them responsible, help to improve the country, and good for their health nevertheless, some students are not responsible sometimes, because they have not being responsible before, and some students will use the chance of being able to attend classes online in a good way. According to BBC News there are 85% of students prefer to attend the classes online than attend to school.

To begin, attend classes online is better than attend the classes at school in many ways. One of the ways is, it helps to build a responsible personalty. For instance, by giving the lessons online students are responsible to attend to class, and take notes; especially when there is a certain time for the classes to begin, and end. This shows that, when the students grow up, and being employees they will be responsible to attend to their jobs at time. This will help to improve our country then it is now; this is new generation! Clearly, attend classes online have a lot of benefits for students, and the country.

Furthermore, by attend classes online will show how clever the students are!

Plus, it is good for their health as well; it makes their brains to be more active. For example, when students have homework to do, they keep thinking about how to do it. Imagine when students have classes at homes, and have homework, how good it is for their brains! This shows that, attend classes online at homes has many benefits for students; it not only shows how clever they are by take classes online, but it helps them to be healthy. Obviously, I would prefer to attend classes online than come to school.

Overall, being able to attend classes online is better than coming to school in many ways. As I wrote the benefits of being able to attend classes online. I think by 2020 all the students will prefer to attend their classes online than come school. In conclusion, attend classes online help to improve the country, and it helps students to show how clever they are; plus, it helps them to be healthy.",0,213
"The future is coming, and it is coming IIN the shape of cars. Driverless cars have been a dream form long ago, and it might just now be coming true.

Although some Popeye think that this is not Avery good idea there many advantages to driverless cars. These cars are safe, well tested, and very helpful.

Some people will argue that the cars might malfunction and crash or not know if there is a work zone and I needs to go slower. Driverless cars are not fully driverless. Although these cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is still a driver. As it said in the article,"" all are designed to noisy the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This would be like if there was a work zone at this point the car would alert the driver and he/she would have to take over. In the article it states that the companies that arr making these cars have added a way of noticing the driver. Some forms of alerting the passenger is by, vibrating meets, announcing that he or she should be prepared, and flashlights on the window shield. They have even thought of using cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention.

Also, these cars have not just recently came out of the factory and put on the streets. Google has been working on its driverless cars since 2009. According to the article, ""their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Yet, their car is not completely driverless, there is still a human that takes over pulling in and out of driveways or in complicated traffic issues. The thought of driverless cars has been here since the 1950s in the article it states that, 'in the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electric cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on front end of the car. ' So then since the 1950s scientist and engineers have been working on and improving this concept of driverless cars. That is more than sixty years of research and work in order to make and some perfect these cars.

After and when driverless cars are final perfected they will have many significant uses. For example, public transportation, everywhere you go there is public transportation, and it is a big need expressly in the big cities. In this passage it states that, the cars would use half of the full of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This would change the world, if cars are diverless it would give the human a great advantage. Also from a fun perspective when people go on long road trips they can normal just drive for about eight hours before they need to rest. With driverless cars the car would do all the work posed to the driver.

In conclusion driverless cars are coming and are a great thing. They will be safe for all users, provide great benefits, and have been well researched and worked on. They are a thing of the future, and we are final there. Driverless cars are a thing everyone should look forward fore.  ",0,214
"Cell Phone Use While Driving

It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment.

Often times crashes are the result of distracted driving. This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high, and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones"").

Many states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16-year-old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. Although cell phones may be used beneficially while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time.

In sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.

"If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, because in the story it's said that '' Face on Mars'' has since become a pop icon. If I was a scientist in NASA I would found out how did the Peron face came to another planet. They have to get out the earth to come to another planet to just put your face on it out of nowhere. But if a person did put there face imprint on an another planet, I think they will turn into an alien. I will tell you why I said that, because people say that aliens are real, and they harm creatures. Also, if I'm the scientist this will tell that a FACE on a human body doing on an another planet they should be on earth. In the article its aids: twenty-five years ago something funny happening around Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Colonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work, and see who's the human face or an alien face because humans on earth an alien in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, its aids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Colonia became a priority for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended.",0,217
"The Face on Mars is one of the most controversial landforms around. Many people think that it is an artifact that was left behind by past civilizations on Mars. On the other hand, there are people that believe it is just a mesa, ""landforms common around the American West."" There are many people in both parties, making for a huge ""debate."" The most logical, however, is that the Face is naturally occurring, due to the evidence that NASA has been able to uncover.

The people that say it is an ancient civilization use illogical evidence for their conclusions, such as, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" However, the people that believe it is naturally occurring use stable evidence, including, ""Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This evidence shows that the best technology we have shows nothing more than, ""a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Another way to show that the Face on Mars is naturally occurring is the comparison to the landforms here on Earth, such as the mesa landforms in the American West. In the passage, Jim Gavin, a chief scientist at NASA, working specifically on Mars exploration, is quoted saying,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Gavin, as said before, is a chief scientist at NASA. If he concludes that it is just like a landform people can see here, then why would anyone be able to argue that?

People strive to find out what is in the unknown. Researchers are some of the people that put their lives into getting the best evidence that they can find about the unknown. The Face on Mars is one example of many projects scientists have put time and effort into. They will always find the best solution or answer to whatever the question may be. Why not trust their conclusions?",0,218
"Introduction

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that education should be enjoyable, engaging, and interactive. This essay will explore three types of enjoyable educational activities available within my school: sports, science, and musical activities. I will compare and contrast the activities in terms of their enjoyment potential, and choose the most enjoyable activity and explain why it is preferable.

Sports

Sports are a great way to stay active and healthy while also learning valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Participating in sports can also help build self-esteem and confidence. However, not everyone enjoys sports, and it can be difficult to find a sport that is enjoyable for everyone. Additionally, sports can be expensive, and not everyone has the financial means to participate.

Science

Science is another great way to learn and engage in an educational activity. Science can be both fun and challenging, and it can help students develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. Science can also help students understand the world around them and develop an appreciation for the natural world. However, science can be difficult for some students, and it may not be enjoyable for everyone.

Musical Activities

Musical activities are a great way to express creativity and develop musical skills. Participating in a school band or choir can be a fun and rewarding experience, and it can also help students develop discipline and time management skills. Additionally, musical activities can be a great way to socialize and make new friends. However, not everyone enjoys music, and it can be difficult to find a musical activity that is enjoyable for everyone.

Comparison and Contrast

While all three activities have their own unique benefits, they also have their own drawbacks. Sports can be expensive and not everyone enjoys them, science can be difficult and not everyone understands it, and musical activities can be limited to certain interests. However, I believe that the most enjoyable activity is science.

Science is a great way to learn and engage in an educational activity. It can be both fun and challenging, and it can help students develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, science can help students understand the world around them and develop an appreciation for the natural world. Science can also be a great way to socialize and make new friends.

"Education is a critical element of any high school student's future, and the importance of this education cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for some students to begin to identify their future career paths before completing their high school education. This premature commitment to one career can have major implications on a student's school work, mental health, and physical health. 

One of the most significant potential problems with committing to a career at a young age is that students may be unprepared or under educated for their chosen profession. Without the necessary education or tools, students may be unable to succeed in their chosen careers, leading to feelings of frustration and diminished self-worth. Additionally, a premature commitment to a career can lead to unrealistic expectations, burn out, and a lack of motivation. 

It is important to provide students with the necessary guidance and support to ensure they have the best chance for success in their future endeavors. Encouraging students to take their time to explore and research various career paths can have positive impacts on their mental and physical health, as well as their school work. Providing students with the tools and resources to develop an individualized plan for their future career can help to ensure that they have the best possible chance of achieving success.",1,220
"Do you think asking multiply people for advice is better than asking one person? Well I think asking multiple people for advice when I need it just to help me get a better understanding, better idea on what to do, see what other peoples thoughts are or sometimes see who gives better advice for future references. During this essay we will be talking about all those things and how they can help.

Getting a better idea on what to do from other people such as school counselors, teacher,parent or guardian, siblings, your friends or anyone you can trust to help, makes decision-making so much better and easier. It's better to see different view points from different people. Then trying to make a hard decision or trying to explain something to someone or even having zero clue on what to do. For example trying to write an essay without brainstorming or having any thought on what to write or type about it's going to be really hard and stressful.

Seeing what other people think when getting advice can sometimes be difficult or helpful. It can be difficult if people don't understand or just don't know what to do and how to explain it to you to think they know what there talking about. It can also be helpful if they understand were your coming from or might have been in the same situation or been down the same path. When looking for advice try finding someone who knows what's going on or has or had the same situation. Make it easier on yourself to find those people even tho it might be difficult just remember you have those people listed above.

If you are ever needing advice ask multiple people for there input or thoughts to see who gives the info you think fits what you need such as, who's you like better, is more detailed, on the subject you need and helps the most etc. when it comes to the people you ask for advice from it is most important you can trust them, and they give you good advice and those are the people who can help you with future references when you need advice down the road. Never rely on someone who is going to lie to you and you don't trust because those people will not help you, and they will make it more difficult and confusing.

In conclusion asking multiple people for advice is more likely more reasonable to help you find what you're looking for and get the information you will need than just asking one person who might have zero clue on what to tell you that will help your situation.",0,221
" Students would benefit from attending a regular school rather than relying on online or video conferencing classes. While there may be some convenience to learning from home, the benefits of attending a physical school far outweigh the negatives. Students will learn more and have a better chance of success if they attend a regular school.

One of the main advantages of attending a regular school is the opportunity for face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. This interaction allows for better communication and understanding of course material, as well as the ability to ask for help and clarification when needed. It also allows for the development of relationships with classmates and the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities.

Another benefit of attending a regular school is the ability to stay active and engaged in the learning process. In a physical classroom, students are more likely to be actively participating in class discussions, asking questions, and collaborating with their peers. This engagement can lead to better retention of information and a deeper understanding of the material.

Additionally, attending a regular school can provide students with a sense of community and belonging. Being surrounded by other students and teachers can provide a support system and a sense of belonging, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling academically or emotionally.

While there may be some convenience to learning from home, the benefits of attending a regular school far outweigh the negatives. Students will learn more, stay active and engaged, and have a better chance of success if they attend a regular school.",1,222
"I think driverless cars sound like a good idea on paper, but in the real world they just are not far enough advanced yet for me to feel safe being in or around one.

They are not even fully driverless yet, a person still needs to be ready to take the wheel at any given time.

However, in the future when they become more advanced and safe they could potential prevent accidents.

I think driverless cars are still a thing of the future and not present.

As much as I think they need to work now, I am not against the development of them as they could bring many potential benefits.

In the article it states how movies and television shows have been fascinated with driverless cars for a long time, seeing them as a thing of the future.

I think they still are a thing of the future because they still need a driver to be able to take the wheel at any given time.

The only way I can see them being the safest they can be, is if all cars are driverless, and they could interact with each other.

Right now the driverless cars are mostly just assisting like antilock brakes, as stated in paragraph six.

When the technology eventually becomes good enough to be able to fully drive without a driver there are still laws to be discussed.

Only a few states allow them so far, and what good is a car that is only legal in three states and the District of Columbia if you do not live there.

I think eventually the laws will change enough to allow them to function as long as they are safe and can pass certain tests.

Then the question comes up about blame in the event of an accident, whose fault is it if a computer is controlling the vehicle?

As of now driverless cars seem to be more trouble than help.

With time, I feel that they could become very safe and reliable vehicles with advancements in technology.

There are many manufacturers trying to make driverless cars, at least one of them is bound to make something good eventually.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars should keep being developed, however they still need a lot of work.",0,223
"Traveling is a great way to explore new places, meet new people, and take a break from everyday life. Many people choose to travel with a group and a tour guide, believing it is the best way to experience a new destination. I agree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel; doing so provides safety and security, the benefit of a knowledgeable guide, and the chance to meet new people.

The first and arguably most important benefit of traveling in a group with a tour guide is safety and security. A reliable guide will be familiar with the area, knowledgeable about the current political situation, and able to provide advice on local customs. A guide will also be able to suggest the best places to stay and eat, and can help provide directions if a group gets lost. Additionally, by traveling in a group, it is less likely that members of the group will be targeted by thieves or attackers.

The second benefit of traveling with a tour guide is the benefit of a knowledgeable guide who can provide valuable insight into the history and culture of the destination. A good guide will provide important information about the local sites, culture, and even the local economy. A guide can also help explain the local customs and laws, which can be especially helpful for those who are unfamiliar with the area.

The third benefit of traveling with a tour guide is the chance to meet new people and make new friends. By traveling with a group, tourists have the chance to meet other travelers who have similar interests and who may have come from different parts of the world. The opportunity to meet new people and share experiences with them can be very rewarding and can help to create lasting memories.

In conclusion, I believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. A tour guide can provide safety and security, the benefit of a knowledgeable guide, and the chance to meet new people. By traveling with a tour guide, tourists can explore new destinations and cultures safe in the knowledge that they are in good hands.

Dear [Senator’s Name],

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College system in the United States. As a student, I have been studying the history and workings of our democratic system, including the Electoral College. After careful consideration and analysis of different perspectives, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished and replaced with a simple popular vote.

First, the Electoral College is an outdated system that does not reflect the will of the people. In the last five presidential elections, the winner of the popular vote did not win the Electoral College four times. This means that the person who received the most votes from the citizens of the United States was not elected as the president. This is a clear violation of the democratic principle of “one person, one vote.”

Second, the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to small states. Because each state is guaranteed a minimum of three electors, regardless of its population, a vote in a small state like Wyoming has four times the power of a vote in a large state like California. This means that the interests and needs of small states are often favored over those of larger states, which is unfair to the majority of the population.

Third, the Electoral College creates an uneven playing field for candidates. Because most states award all their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in their state, candidates focus their campaigns on swing states instead of the needs of the entire country. This means that some states and their issues are ignored, while others receive disproportionate attention.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a flawed system that needs to be replaced with a simple popular vote. A popular vote would ensure that the winner of the presidency reflects the will of the people and that every vote counts equally. This would be a more fair and just system for all Americans.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It could also be one of the most dangerous planets too. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks it's a good idea to strive further into exploring Venus even with the dangers the planet contains.

One of the reasons the author believes we should keep finding new things about Venus is because it was though to be similar to Earth. Venus and Earth are even called ""twins"" because they are thought to be so alike. Venus was thought to once be covered in oceans that could have possibly supported life at a point in time. Venus also contains similar things to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. The only way we could figure more things out about Venus would be if we kept sending this such as rovers to research it and possibly humans one day.

Another reason the author thinks we should find more information about Venus is because Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in our solar system aside from Mars. Venus or Mars would be the next step in our space exploration. If we do send rovers or people to Venus one day, we would need things that could withstand the heat and other chaos that happens on the surface of Venus. The author states that NASA has come up with an idea that contained a blimp-like vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface of Venus that would carry scientists and would allow them to study the surface. The temperatures inside the blimp would be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and air pressure that would be close to sea level on Earth. The conditions would be rough, but humans can withstand it.

Though Venus is dangerous, that doesn't mean it's not possible for humans or rovers to explore its surface one day. Humans are driven by curiosity that leads us into similar places. If we can make it to the Moon, we can most likely one day make it to Venus and back. If humans were to one day even land on Venus, it would be a giant achievement for the human race.",0,226
"Think about walking into your second period class, and you have a test. This is a test that you have to pass, but you have no clue what the test is going to be over. You sit down, and your heart starts pounding so fast that you feel sick to your stomach. You're so scared to take this test because your not sure if you're going to pass it or not. ""You make begin"", your teacher says. Reading a few questions in your head and you don't know any of the answers. Have you ever thought about technology being able to help you? Should technology be able to read students emotional expressions?

The Facial Action Coding System is a 3D computer model of the face. It uses your facial muscles to determine how your feeling. For example if you are feeling anger the computer would know because your orbicularis Boris tightens your lips to show the anger. This device would be able to be showed by a real face or even a painting like the Mona Lisa. This computer can even show mixed emotions.

Technology is a valuable resource for students. The new technology called the ""Facial Actions Coding System"" would be great for students. This is something that will be able to read your face and let people know if your bored, tired, happy, sad, and it even shows your fears. If your struggling on a test or an assignment it will give you help and walk you through some problems. This would help many students understand the concept and test scores would be so much higher.

According to the article people are able to tell if you are having a bad day. People can not tell what is wrong with you just because you look sad or upset. Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles that can convey certain emotions. If you look at the painting of Mona Lisa you would be able to tell from her facial structures of what type of mood she is trying to show. When looking at the Mona Lisa, it really intended to make you smile and in a happy mood.

How would you want to feel when taking a test and understanding the concept better? Wouldn't you want to be able to have higher test scores and better grades? Do you think that the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable resource for students?

The FACS would benefit a lot of students in the world. Do you think that technology should be able to read students emotions?",0,227
"The development of distance learning classes has dramatically altered the way students approach their schooling. Distance learning classes have provided students with more opportunities to become self-directed and self-motivated, while creating new obstacles to overcome when it comes to taking responsibility for their own education. Some students may take advantage of the lack of structure present in these classes by skipping classes and engaging in activities that are non-academic in nature. This type of self-imposed irresponsibility can have an immensely negative impact on their motivation and expectations for their learning. On one hand, the lack of structure and supervision can allow students the freedom to take more responsibility for their own learning, but on the other hand, it can lead to neglect of their educational obligations. Ultimately, distance learning classes have opened up new possibilities for students in terms of learning opportunities, as well as potential pitfalls in terms of difficulty in maintaining motivation and expectations for their own education.",1,228
"I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars provide many benefits, mandatory participation should not be required for several reasons.

Firstly, not all students have the time or availability to commit to an after-school activity every week. Many students have jobs, care for family members, or have long commutes that make staying late difficult. Forcing these students to choose between their responsibilities and following the new rule is unreasonable. 

Secondly, extracurricular activities will not appeal to all students' interests. There is a wide variety of clubs and sports, but not all students will find one they genuinely enjoy. Forcing participation could cause unhappiness and discouragement rather than promoting engagement. Students should have freedom to decide how they spend their free time.

Finally, some students may have physical, medical, or psychological conditions that prevent safe involvement in competitive groups. While many activities accommodate special needs, mandatory policies do not consider individual circumstances. This could disadvantage vulnerable students and interfere with personal healthcare decisions. 

Instead of a mandatory policy, the principal could encourage involvement through persuasive recommendations highlighting benefits like leadership, teamwork and stress relief. Students still able to choose while being informed. Subsidies for low-income families could improve access without compulsion. 

In conclusion, while extracurriculars offer valuable skills and memories, mandatory participation policies infringe on students' freedom and circumstances. Positive promotion better serves more interests than blanket rules. Students' well-being, availability and self-direction should determine their involvement in after-school activities.",1,229
"New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. According to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The children said (hold up!

" Dear principal,

I am writing to suggest that we consider implementing a policy change to require a minimum B grade in sports. I believe that this would motivate students to work harder and achieve better grades, leading to a more engaged student body and improved health outcomes.

By requiring a minimum B grade in sports, students would be more likely to take the time to learn and improve their skills, rather than simply participating for the sake of participation. This would lead to a more competitive and challenging environment, which would in turn lead to better performance and improved athletic abilities.

Furthermore, a minimum B grade in sports would encourage students to take their grades more seriously and seek help from their teachers or stay after school for tutoring. This would lead to a more focused and dedicated student body, which would translate to better academic performance overall.

I also believe that a minimum B grade in sports would make colleges more interested in recruiting students who have demonstrated a high level of dedication and commitment to their athletic pursuits. This would lead to more scholarships and opportunities for students who excel in sports, which would be a great motivator for them to continue working hard in their academic pursuits.

Finally, I believe that a minimum B grade in sports would help reduce the number of students who struggle with test anxiety or poor study habits. By requiring a minimum B grade in sports, students would be more likely to prioritize their studies and develop good study habits, which would translate to better performance on exams and tests.

In conclusion, I believe that a minimum B grade in sports would have many positive effects on our school and its students. I urge you to consider this policy change and I believe it would be a great benefit for our school and its students.

"Would you want to be forced to spend extra time at school? In my opinion you should not have to be forced into an extra activity because people have things to do after school. Also, they already spend 7 or 8 hours at school and should not have extra time. Adding to that people need a break from school to be refreshed the next day because school is stressful.

Students should not be forced to attend after school activities adding to their day because some students have activities after school like music lessons. Students come home from a long day of school and have homework to do and should not have an after school activity because that will give them less time for homework. Also, some students have a job and an after school activity can effect them financially. Also, some students for me as an example have music lessons after school and that cannot happen if there is an added activity to my schedule.

Students already spend 7 or 8 hours at school and should not have to spend extra time. Students need a break because school can be stressful and with an extra activity you could be with someone you don't like or just want to be home and the activity will delay that. Being at home you can also feel independent because at school you have to ask to get water or use the bathroom and at home you can anything whenever you want and spending 8 hours of having to ask to get water or use the bathroom can really be a pain and being at an extra activity can lengthen that.

Students need a break from school because school is hard. School is a stressful place and the longer the break from it the better the next day will be. Also tests can be stressful and to do good on that test you need to be free minded and be refreshed, and you can do that by not going to an extra activity. Besides people at school can be stressful, for example if there is someone at school bullying you being home away from them can make you feel safe.

Having to be forced to and extra school activity should not be permitted because students have things after school, Also they are already at school for 7 or 8 hours and need a break, and adding to that students just need a break. The brain works better on a clear mind and having an after school activity can lessen that.",0,232
"There are positive consequences as well as negative consequences for the development of these Driverless Cars. It's good that technology is advancing, and the world is in a better place because of these things. It's not bad that things are starting to change including our daily use cars. Furthermore, it's good to be able to create new things that are interesting and enjoy the things that are being produced. I oppose to this new invention of cars, however.

People might be excited hearing this advance technology such as the Driverless Cars that are being introduced. However, I'm against these Driverless Cars that are about to be sold. You might think that cars being controlled by itself without the drivers would be fascinating and cool for you, but there is also danger ahead of us. Of course, it's the job for the companies to sell out to you and try to earn whatever amount of money they could, it's not their responsibility of driving for us after buying it. The cars are not even fully recommended by the producers yet; they are finding ways to improve it. However, it's not fully guarantee that we will be safe as long as we are in the car.

It's our choice whether we want to get this new car or not, but know that in your mind there will at least a consequence. These cars are cool and looks awesome in our eyes, nor is a Bliss to own one. Even so, we should know that these cars are not a hundred percent safe. The text state,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. "" This shows that we also have to ready to take over when something doesn't seem right. It's not like the Driverless Cars will take care of us.

Imagine you are texting while in these Driverless Cars going to your work. You just let the car control when suddenly a road ahead of you is being constructed, at that moment, you probably might not be alert or anything. The car then had an accident and the one to blame is you, the driver. What I meant to say is that these cars aren't that safe as we think it is. We also have to take the responsible for Bangor alert or else something might happen. The text said that if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? This tells us that it's not guarantee that the manufacturer will take full responsibility of us when something bad happens. We have to take care of ourselves.

These Driverless Cars might be convenient in some ways, but always know that it's not always safe. What's the use of always staying on alert when you bought the car thinking it can drive itself without the need of the driver. Even thought it's a fancy thing that the car could drive by itself, it still needs the help of the driver. If something is about to happen in the middle of the highway, what are you going to do? It's really dangerous just thinking about it. Our life really determine on our own actions when driving this Drivels Cars.

"Driving while texting is very dangerous for people on the roads. Millions of people have died from car accidents and texting while driving. I don't have driver license yet, but I will be safe on the road when I get them. I have been in car accidents because other people were not paying attention and hit our car. Furthermore, I am glad they created the Hands-Free law to keep us safe.

The Hands-Free law was created to keep people from communicating while behind the wheel. If you have something to tell someone it can wait until you pull over. Car accidents happen everyday on the interstate because people are not aware of their surroundings. I would agree with people using their phone behind the wheel only for emergencies. Most people are not good with multitasking and driving.

I have driven while on my phone only to run an errand. I was bored, so I called my friend to figure out other plans. Furthermore, I was safe while using my phone nothing happened. Although, that doesn't make chances short it won't happen next time. I will be more careful next time to decision or drunk drivers to.  ",0,234
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer reflective of the will of the people. In the past five presidential elections, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election twice. This is unacceptable. In a democracy, the candidate who receives the most votes should win the election.

There are many reasons why the Electoral College is unfair. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than in large states. This is because each state has a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of its population. For example, a voter in Wyoming has about three times the voting power as a voter in California.

Second, the Electoral College can lead to the election of a president who does not have the support of a majority of the people. This has happened twice in the past five elections. In 2000, George W. Bush won the presidency even though he lost the popular vote to Al Gore. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency even though he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few swing states, rather than campaigning throughout the country. This is because a candidate can win the presidency with a majority of the electoral votes, even if they do not win the most popular votes.

I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. This would be a fair and democratic way to choose our president.

"25 years ago, around Mars, a spacecraft from NASA was circling the planet.

It was taking pictures, until something strange happened. An enormous head appeared and seemed to be staring back at the camera.

A few scientists believed the Face, was made by an ""alien."" NASA has been discussing of what have may cause making a face on Mars. We had millions of answers but didn't know which one was right.

Aliens did it. They are the ones who created the face! ""Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact."" First, no one knows for sure what have may have caused it. It could've been the atmosphere, or it could've been an ""alien."" Scientists thought it was probably a ""Martian mesa"", only this one almost looked like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh."" You see, the shadow gave an ""illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.""

It was a good way to attract the public to the attention of Mars. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

"Usage of cars should be limited for many reasons.  Many people in different countries agree that cars should be either banned or not used as constantly.  Pollution, Economy, and people's health are all a factor to limiting car usage.

There is a fee to park in Vauban which is a coast of $40,000.  No one is going to want to drive due to that outrageous price.  70 percent of the people living in Vauban doesn't own a car and, 57 percent sold their car once they moved there.  ""'When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way' said Hadron Walter"".  This quote shows that cars just bring you done emotional, and you'll feel better without one.  In Vauban, cars are causing 12 percent of greenhouse gases.  The percent of greenhouse gases are four times higher in the U.S. do to car's gas emissions.

Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While switching to a national popular vote may seem attractive in theory, I believe the Electoral College is a better system and helps protect our democratic process in several important ways.

One argument made in favor of a popular vote is that it would make every citizen's vote equally important. However, the current system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider geographic range of voters. Without the Electoral College, candidates could focus all their efforts on population centers, ignoring the concerns of rural states. This could diminish political participation across large parts of the country. 

It is also important to consider that the United States is a representative republic rather than a pure democracy. The Founders intentionally created the Electoral College to have the President elected by representative electors instead of a direct vote. They feared that passions of the moment could sway a national popular vote. The Electoral College system helps safeguard against temporary emotional reactions and promotes more stable and long-term decision-making. 

Finally, opponents argue that a candidate could lose the national popular vote but still win the election. While this has occurred a few times, it is not necessarily a flaw but rather a feature of federalism. The Electoral College requires candidates to assemble blocs of support across many states rather than just in population centers. This ensures that candidates pay attention to political considerations nationwide rather than just in a handful of cities or regions. 

In conclusion, while reasonable people can disagree on this issue, I believe the Electoral College has served our country well and helps preserve key aspects of our democratic process. It deserves to be maintained as our system for electing the President. I hope you will consider supporting it as well. Thank you for your consideration.

"The concept that a culture perpetuates its own ideas and fears through formal education is undeniably true, and is exemplified in many forms in our society today. Though there is some level of debate around what certain concepts should be taught, and how they should be presented, it is largely agreed that formal education is an essential part of a culture's ability to maintain its own values, beliefs, and fears.

To begin, formal education allows a culture to pass on it's most cherished beliefs to the next generation. This is done by incorporating cultural values into the curriculum and encouraging students to adopt these values for themselves. For example, many school curriculums include a focus on the importance of democracy, the value of hard work, and the importance of respecting and protecting the environment. These core values are embedded into the curriculum, allowing students to learn and internalize these ideas in a way that is often more meaningful and effective than simply teaching facts and figures. 

Furthermore, formal education can also be used to discredit ideas that a culture opposes or fears. In many cases, this involves pushing back against ideas and beliefs that are seen as contrary to existing values. For example, in many schools, students are taught not to accept racism or discrimination under any circumstance. This is done in part by teaching students about the painful effects of racism, and by emphasizing the need for acceptance of people of all backgrounds. In this way, formal education can not only teach students about what is acceptable, but also about what is unacceptable, and thus help to counter ideas that are seen as threatening to a culture.

Finally, formal education also serves as a platform for a culture to express its fears and anxieties. By offering courses in history, literature, and other disciplines, students are exposed to the struggles and challenges that the culture has faced in the past, as well as the potential dangers that it faces in the present and future. For example, a course in world history may include a focus on the devastating effects of war, or a course in literature may include readings of dystopian fiction, allowing students to have a greater understanding of the fears and anxieties that their culture has experienced.

In conclusion, formal education is an essential tool for a culture to perpetuate its ideas and fears. By teaching its core values, pushing back against dangerous ideas, and exposing students to its fears, formal education can help a culture maintain its identity and protect it'self from external threats. To put it'simply, formal education is the key to a culture's success.

"Of the many planets in our solar system, Venus would be the worst to travel to. This planet is highly dangerous. The conditions are horrendous, and some people are thinking of traveling there. The cost of building a ship capable of withstanding Venus's conditions would be crazily high. The fact that the author would want to travel to, and support the idea of, Venus is outrageous. Even then, they did not support their claim too well in their article.

Venus is the second planet from the sun. According to the text, the surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also, the planet has many earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and often has many lightning strikes that take down probes that wish to know the secrets of the surface. Pressure levels are also off the charts and could crush the ship anyone was travelling in.

The author of the text was not too convincing of their claim to explore Venus. The title itself does not help the claim either This planet, as said by the author, is very dangerous. Traveling to Venus and making sure conditions are suitable for people, is not very achievable. The author seems to want to travel there and supports the idea, but they do not support their claim very much. Most of the article talks about how perilous the planet is for people to travel to. They could have supported themselves better if they talked about the benefits instead of only the dangers.

All in all, travelling to Venus would be a waste of time and money. If NASA risks the lives of people by sending them, then the trip would be for nothing. With the dangerous conditions to consider, the contemplation of whether to travel there is out of the question. The answer is no. It's too unsafe to put peoples' lives on the line only because scientists are curious about a dangerous planet.",0,241
"Ralph Waldo Emerson says""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" On one hand, some people disagree with statement. On the other hand, some people agree with this statement. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow, it makes them feel good, and make their live easier.

However, not everybody agrees with position, some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they don't want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. Nevertheless, this opposition other important, namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For example, my biggest fear in live is airplanes and I have never been on it, but if I try it for the first time in my live even I scare or not next time, i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and I try it. I could do more. Furthermore, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live.

In addition, it makes us feel good. For instance, my cousin was always sad, and she hated to try new things. One day we went swimming, everyone had fun except my cousin. After condensing her for a long time, she tries it. On that time, my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus, people should try new things to make them feel good and happy.

Finally, it makes the live easy. To illustrate, if someone is so strike in live and doesn't want to try something beyond what he/she already mastered, that person will have a hard live. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. Moreover, we should get out of our comfort zone, so we could have an easy live.

Based on this argument, one must conclude, people never get better unless they try new things in live. In the whole, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement was true based of the reasons.",0,242
"There are plenty advantages to limiting car use on this Earth. For example, limiting car use can lead to a cleaner environment, better overall health of the people and the Earth, and overall, just a better place to live. Cutting down on car usage can be very beneficial for the planet, along with future generations of people.

First, limiting car use can lead to a better place to live in. If we were to slow down on the use of gas, there would be fewer wars over oil in other countries. We as a race can change the world, one car at a time. Lowering the amount of driving wouldn't be an easy change, but surely one worthwhile.

Secondly, giving up cars completely might not be necessary, but emitting toxic gas fumes can be easily avoided simply by switching to an electric car. There are many affordable electric cars that can help stop the fumes from traveling into the ozone layer, which can prolong our Earth's life, our lives, and can stop global warming dead in its tracks. Who doesn't want to keep this wonderful weather?

Lastly, cutting down on driving automobiles might have an effect on saving people from car accidents caused by unfit drivers. Thousands of people die every day from unnecessary car usage. If we were to cut the amount of driving in half, the rate of death due to car accidents would find a steep decline.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can make the world a better place. This decision can lead to better health, less death due to car accidents, prolonging our planet's health, and fewer complaints about those roller-coaster like gas prices! It only takes one person to make a change, so decide if you want to be the one to potentially save the world.",0,243
"Cars are part of our daily routines, they have been around for so long that we can't even remember when they first showed up, but did you know that people are starting to use other means for transportation?. Studies have shown that the number of miles driven in the United States has dropped steadily ever since 2005, and as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak.

Part of the reason lies in the recession, Americans with a low income can't afford to buy new cars; not mentioning the unemployed, and now that recovery is under way, the next few years will be telling if the decrease will stop, or continue. But looking at the bright side, if the pattern persists (and many believe it will) it will be beneficial towards carbon emissions and the environment, without considering the fact that car transportation is one of the largest source of America's editions.

America isn't the only country that has seen a major decrease in car transportation, other places have taken steps to decrease the use of cars. For example, in VAUBAN, Germany, the residents of this community have given up their cars, that's right!, Vauban's are completely ""car-free"". Owning a car is allowed, but they manly be parked in two places, garages that can be purchased for $40,000, and of course, a home. As a result, seventy percent of the population does not own a car.

But why are they doing this?. Well, automobiles are used widely all around the globe, and that ID a huge impediment to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe... and up 50 percent in some car-intesive area in the United States, that's why some places are trying to stop using vehicles, the advantage of not using cars relies on the fact that cars are dangerous to our planet, and we have to take care of our planet.

Finally,(and most importantly)France and Colombia are taking major steps to fight the over-use of cars. Since Paris has more smog than any other European capital, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numberd plates the following day, as a result congestion was down 60 percent in Paris after 5 days. And in Bogotá, Colombia, there has been a ""car-free day"" for over three years now in an attempt to promote alternative transportation, people who refuse not use their cars are fine with a $25 dollar fine, because of this, the turnout has been large. And it has led to the construction oh 118 miles of bicycle paths.

So.... do you still want to use car?... or a bicycle?.  ",0,244
"The principle's decision of making all the students participate in extracurricular activities can be a good decision and a bad decision, but it can go either way. A lot of people probably agree with this decision because doing activities that is not sitting in your room on your phone or on other electronics can be fun. These activities can be something that you have never done before or something that you actually enjoy doing. I know that some students would try to come up with an excuse to not do activities because they don't feel like it, or they're lazy. On the other hand, other students do really like doing activities. For example, most kids do a sport, whether it is soccer, basketball, lacrosse, or baseball, I have seen kids enjoy doing sports. There are other activities like participating in a club like yearbook or serving on the student council. Even if you feel like nothing is for you there is always that one thing that you love doing or that one thing that keeps you company.

Like I said this decision can go either way. Doing extracurricular activities can also be a bad thing because it can take up time. A lot of students have a busy schedule that they just don't have time for activities. For example, students could have other things they need to do at home like taking care of younger siblings, having a lot of homework to do, or preparing for a test. It could also be that a lot of students are independent and they just don't feel like working with other people. I remember that when I was younger I didn't like working with other kids, I was very independent. I didn't like when I was forced to do things with other kids. Since some students feel this way it would be a little sad that some kids would have be forced to do something that they don't like to do.

When I was about nine years old my mom put me on a gymnastics team. At first, I was angry that my mom signed me up for gymnastics, but it wasn't because I didn't like gymnastics, it was because I didn't want to meet new people. After a week of being there I started to think that maybe it wasn't such a bad idea. Now I'm so glad that I listened to my mom. I really like participating in sports and other activities. Working with other people is really fun, even if I didn't like the idea at first. At the end of the day, even if there are bad outcomes from this decision, I agree with the principles decision.",0,245
"As an 8th grader, I strongly believe that attending school from home can have numerous benefits for students. While some may argue that traditional schools provide a more immersive learning experience, I believe that the advantages of distance learning far outweigh any drawbacks.

Firstly, attending school from home can greatly benefit students who struggle with anxiety or depression. For these students, the pressure of navigating a crowded and noisy school environment can be overwhelming, leading to increased stress and anxiety. By attending school from home, these students can avoid the stressors of a traditional school setting and learn in a more comfortable and familiar environment. Additionally, distance learning can provide these students with more flexibility and control over their learning experience, which can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with self-regulation.

Another benefit of attending school from home is the potential for improved academic performance. In a traditional school setting, drama and rumors can often distract from the learning process, leading to decreased productivity and motivation. By removing these distractions, distance learning can allow students to focus more intently on their academic work and achieve better grades. Furthermore, distance learning can provide students with more personalized attention and feedback from teachers, which can lead to improved academic outcomes.

However, some may argue that distance learning lacks the social interaction and face-to-face communication that is essential for student development. While it is true that distance learning can lack the social aspect of traditional schooling, it can also provide students with the opportunity to connect with peers and teachers in a more flexible and convenient manner. For example, through video conferencing or online forums, students can participate in group discussions and collaborative projects without the need for in-person interactions.

Finally, attending school from home can provide students with more flexibility and autonomy in their learning experience. Traditional schools often have rigid schedules and curricula, which can be limiting for students who have different learning styles or interests. By contrast, distance learning can provide students with more control over their learning pace and content, allowing them to pursue their interests and learning goals in a more personalized manner.

In conclusion, while traditional schools have their own advantages, I believe that attending school from home can provide numerous benefits for students. By providing a more",1,246
"Dear Principal,

I believe no cell phones is the way to go. I believe this because students who use cell phones in school will be off task and no do there work.

One reason why I think this is because the students need to get an education and n not worry about that text they just received.

Another reason I have that might convince you to listen to this is because if you follow up with this rule students in the school will stop worrying about phones and more about school.

Witch means better grades and behavior and also better testing scores.

Maybe even less drama because as you see there are many conflicts that come from texting and social net works because someone said something over a text message.

So by not allowing this you could possibly prevent fights, and other harmful situations from happening.

Students also have all before school and after school even weekends to text, so it shouldn't be happening in school.

If you were to let the students have their cell phones out and let them text, they wouldn't pay attention in class, not no what there doing, and get bad grades on important test and even homework.

They also might not listen to the teacher when he or she is talking witch might aggravate them and become mad at the student.

To finalize this statement I have to share with you, I would like to say if you consider this idea this could really change how the school runs and make things better than they were.

So thank you for reading this, and hopefully you consider this idea for a better and brighter future.

"Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice for a few key reasons. First, getting different perspectives allows you to consider more alternatives and options that you may not have thought of on your own. Each person you ask is likely to have had different experiences that could potentially provide new ideas or approaches. 

Secondly, discussing your dilemma with more than one person acts as a check against any biases a single advisor might have. No one individual can ever provide a perfectly objective view - we all have our own preferences, prejudices or blind spots. However, balancing various viewpoints helps mitigate those influences by bringing more overall neutrality. You're less likely to be swayed in one direction if different advisors point out both pros and cons instead of just focusing on what favors their own preferences.

A third benefit is that more counsel means more chances of getting well-rounded, thoughtful advice. Any individual you speak to may not consider all angles or implications of the choices comprehensively. But together, multiple advisors can point you toward factors you hadn't accounted for and play ""devil's advocate"" by countering arguments you'd made to yourself. No one person can anticipate and address every possible concern or objection, so combining insights broadens the advice. 

In conclusion, while any one advisor could potentially provide helpful guidance, seeking input from a variety of trusted sources allows you to view your situation from more standpoints. This balanced approach can better equip you to weigh your options and ultimately make the choice that seems most reasonable after seriously evaluating alternatives from many perspectives. Getting multiple opinions helps ensure a decision is well-informed instead of potentially missing important things a single recommendation alone might overlook.",1,248
"There are many people who say that the government shouldn't put money on building theaters and sports stadiums. They say that the money should be spent on medical care and education.

"While distance learning provides flexibility, attending classes in person offers significant benefits that better support student development and learning. Some advantages of in-person classes include direct personal interactions, enhanced focus and attention, as well as access to resources that strengthen the learning experience. 

Personal interactions are an invaluable part of the school experience. In a physical classroom, students can ask questions to their teachers and classmates face-to-face. Nuanced discussions and spontaneous collaborations often emerge from direct exchanges. Distance learning relies on electronic communication which can make real-time discussions more difficult and lacks the personal dimension of in-person interactions. 

It can also be challenging for students to maintain focus and pay attention while learning from home, where distractions are plentiful. With their own entertainment and chores so accessible, students studying remotely may be tempted to multitask or have their attention wander. The structure of physically going to school helps form productive study habits and keeps students engaged during class time. 

Attending class in person additionally provides access to important learning resources that may not be as easily available at home. Labs, workshops, libraries and specialized facilities enrich the educational experience in many subjects. Hands-on activities and demonstrations in areas like science and arts benefit greatly from in-person instruction. Extracurricular activities are also best supported through on-campus involvement versus online participation. 

In conclusion, while distance learning has value in providing flexibility, students are generally better served through traditional in-person classes. The social and focused nature of campus education combined with access to helpful resources strengthen learning outcomes. Therefore, attending classes at school rather than from home better supports students' academic and personal development.",1,250
"Dear Principal,

In high school there are many difficult decisions to make. What classes to take? Do I want or need a job? Who should I associate with? What dress should I wear to the prom? You know, things like that. I know that you have recently stated that you would like all students to participate in some form of community service and even though it is a very stressful and busy time I completely agree.

I think that it is very important to give to your community and always try to help out. Furthermore, I believe that some services could be picking up trash, tutoring, helping plant flowers around that school to make it look a little more welcoming. Furthermore, I also think that participating in this activity teaches responsibility, respect for hard work, and it also gives us an intake on things outside high school. This could also help some students decide on which career path to take. Depending on if they might realize some improvements that could be made to make the community better as a whole and decide to be on the town committee. Or even if they enjoy teaching younger kids and wish to follow a path into educating.

This project, I believe, would better both our school and community in the long run. I hope that my perspective has helped you on your decision and I wish to thank you for your time and dedication you put into the bettering this school.

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes about how a new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions. I rather not be scanned by a computer to tell me my emotions. I don't think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable.

The first reason that I think we shouldn't have computer scanning are face because we need privacy. I wouldn't want a computer scanning me to see if I was happy, sad, tired, or mad. Example of the computer testing someone"" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Also, there's no need to know there emotions some people don't want you to.

Second reason is that I wouldn't want to pay for it. Some students couldn't afford it. Others could buy it but why would they are at school to learn not to know other peoples emotions. Example what the emotion scanner would do"" if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you from next ad will be I different."" This shows me that you don't need it because all it shows your emotions an what kinds ads others ruff that could help you. There's no point for this if it not helping you with school activities.

Third reason is what's the point of having this. It does benefit a little bit by changing stuff the computer to change our mood. Example of this ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" But rather than that it doesn't help us. It doesn't help us get good grades, doesn't show us what to do in class, and doesn't help your teachers either.

So in this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" where they other talks about computer showing your emotions isn't valuable to any school. The Facial Coding System is just showing your emotions not helping you in school. It's also probably very expensive some people couldn't afford it. That's why I think it's not valuable or needed in a school.",0,252

"The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes throughout the years. There was never a significant meaning to having a car; it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.

The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized 'Mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article,

The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S. ""to curb the United States's been house gases emissions will get a fortuitous assist from an incident shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors; internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and car-pooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960s. The United States have the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.

Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful, but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article,

Paris bans driving due to smog, ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" However, not all the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plug-ins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogotá, Colombia, had similar situations as the people that live in France.

In the country of Colombia there has been a day dedicated to doing things with no car; it's a car-free day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogotá, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24-hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face $25 fines. The article,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the car-free day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""its good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everything that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage, but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.""

In the end of it all cars have always been in the making; trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.  ",0,254
"Transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions Rosenthal 34. Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on, part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizarre due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Genetically, ""stores are being placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Rosenthal 6"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States Rosenthal 5"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants than regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Silky studied carefree day in Bogotá, and he stated ""rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic28"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress... Selsky 24"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris Duffer 14. Hadron Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health Rosenthal 43. You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options, and you have the opportunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to.",0,255
"In recent years, the use of technology and digital resources have influenced how people interact with one another. Examples such as Google Translator, Google, and YouTube have become more commonplace in our day-to-day lives, making it increasingly easy to influence someone without having to use physical examples. However, there are still many other ways to influence someone without relying on examples, such as verbal communication and body language. 

Verbal communication and body language are still effective means for conveying thoughts, feelings, and intentions. Through the use of words, facial expressions, and gestures, people can easily communicate their desires to one another without being constrained by the need to provide examples or visuals. Even when someone may not understand the language of the speaker, these other forms of communication can still serve to influence. 

While technology and digital resources are convenient and often times helpful when trying to influence someone, they should not be relied upon as the only means. There is much to be said for considering other options such as verbal communication and body language, as the impact they have on the listener should not be trivialized. By understanding the many ways in which we can influence someone, we can better equip ourselves with the knowledge and resources needed to effectively communicate our ideas and intentions without using tangible examples.",1,256

"Dear Mr. Principal,

Cell phones should be a privilege each student should receive. Students should be able to use their phones during lunch period or other free time. As long as it will be off during class. Students should be able to use their phones during free time for important emergencies and parent contact for an important reason. Also, students should be able to use are phone to send a text message to a friend about something they need to talk about.

During free time students should be allowed to use phones to contact their friends or family if anything happened to them. If your child was in school when something happened to them wouldn't you want to know about it? Wouldn't you want to find out how it happened and help them? That's why I think cell phones are an important device to have with you if anything happens. You could call for help or be able to call your friends to talk to them.

Kids these days like electronics. That's what's it's all about. Texting friends and playing games. Kids should have a privilege like that in school. During free time or when their walking the track. Kids should be able to listen to music and text. I think we should be able to use our phones without having a teacher yell at you for having it out or taking them away doesn't it sometime get annoying to keep taking phones?

You should allow students to use phones for many reasons. It wouldn't make a difference if they used it during free time. They aren't doing any work at that time so why not let them use their phones. You should think about it. Think about when a kid is going through something hard in school or if something happened, and they disappeared. No one would want that to be their child, and you wouldn't want that to be yours, would you? Cell phones could be distracting but It's for a good cause. A cause to save someone's life.

Also, some people might think it's invading their privacy if they didn't give the person permission to read their emotional expressions.

Reading other peoples emotional expressions without permission can cause the person to get angry because they might not want others to know how their feeling. I think it would be better to see how the person is acting and if you see that they aren't acting the way they usually do then you can ask them how their feeling or if their okay instead of using technology to read someone's emotional expressions. For example, in the text in paragraph 5 it talks about how you can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face. Some people don't like others knowing how their feeling because they might think that the person is going to go off and tell others. They might be afraid that their going to make fun of them.

Using technology can give you false information if not used properly. It can read that your happy but in reality you can be sad or angry you just aren't showing it because you don't want others to know. Also, it can read that your sad but in reality you're trying to show people that your happy, so they don't ask you what's wrong. If the person who read your expression through their computer goes up to you and tells you they know that you aren't happy it can make the person feel angry because they were trying so hard not to let people know that they aren't upset.

Sometimes just asking someone in person how their feeling can be better than using technology because nowadays that's all people use, so most people don't communicate in person. Asking someone how they feel can make them feel better if they know they have someone they can talk to and not through technology. Some people can fake their expressions so using technology won't always be as right as asking someone in person how their actually feeling.

These are a couple of reasons why I think the use of technology to read peoples emotional expressions isn't valuable to know how someone is feeling.  ",0,261
"Michelangelo's quote, ""I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free,"" highlights the importance of having a strong mindset and setting high standards for oneself. This quote suggests that success comes from seeing the potential within oneself and working towards achieving it. In order to reach difficult goals, one must develop a strong mindset and a positive attitude towards success.

Successful people are those who have developed these traits and have used them to their advantage. They have set high standards for themselves and have worked tirelessly towards achieving them. They have also developed a strong mindset that allows them to overcome obstacles and setbacks. This mindset is often rooted in a belief in their own abilities and a willingness to take risks in order to achieve their goals.

On the other hand, those who struggle to reach their goals often lack these traits. They may not have a clear vision of what they want to achieve or may not believe in their own abilities. They may also lack the determination and resilience necessary to overcome obstacles and setbacks. This can lead to a negative attitude towards success, which can further hinder their ability to achieve their goals.

Positive thinking is a key component of success. Those who have a positive attitude towards success are more likely to take action towards achieving their goals. They are also more likely to overcome obstacles and setbacks, as they view them as opportunities for growth and learning. On the other hand, those with a negative attitude towards success may give up easily and may not be motivated to take action towards achieving their goals.

In order to develop these traits, one must focus on setting high standards for themselves and working towards achieving them. This may involve taking risks and stepping outside their comfort zone. It may also involve developing a strong mindset that allows them to overcome obstacles and setbacks. This mindset can be developed through practicing self-reflection, seeking feedback from others, and learning from past failures.

In conclusion, Michelangelo's quote highlights the importance of having a strong mindset and setting high standards for oneself in order to achieve success. Successful people have developed these traits and have used them to their advantage. Positive thinking is also a key component of success, as it allows one to take action towards achieving their goals and overcome obstacles and setbacks. By focusing on setting high standards, developing a strong mindset",1,262
"Phones and Driving

Phones have become such an integral part of today's society in such a small amount of times. To the point where it is now considered surprising to not have one of these handheld devices. People are able to contact their family from miles away, check up on the weather, and even entertain themselves on their by watching videos or playing games. However, it isn't all good. Phones become entertaining to the point of distraction. Most of the world having to come up with new rules and laws for these devices and anything like them. 26% of the population getting into car accidents from being distracted by their phones from texting ('How Many Car Accidents Are Caused by Cellphones?' by Bay and Associates). Question is, should drivers be able to use their phones while driving in any capacity? Especially with the rise of their popularity and use with each generation?

Phones should be continued to be used by drivers in most capacities. Not everything should be allowed to continue or be taken off of the law, like the use of any social media or texting for example, because a phone has more uses than that. Texting if obviously the main thing we blame car accidents on, but sometimes it's more than that. Social media platforms can lead to distractions as well. Snapchat, a picture/video media platform led to a girl taking a photo in her car only to crash not even 20 minutes later back in April 2019 ('Teen who drove 106mph, used Snapchat in crash that killed friend is going to prison.' by Noah Fat). While things like that are horrible they shouldn't be banned completely while driving. If someone gets lost on their road they can always use Google Maps to get back home to said person's families. Maybe a family member or close friend is having an emergency, medical or otherwise, and tries to call up that person, but they can't say anything due to their phone being banned. Leaving the Family member/friend to be alone or call someone else.

There is also the fact that not all car accidents are caused by texting and driving. Yes. It is a leading cause, but there are plenty of other causes of car accidents ('Top 15 Causes Of Car Accidents And How You Can Prevent Them.' by Elizabeth Liza King). There are the causes that are more human error. There is distracted driving, drinking and driving, speeding, running a red light, etc. Then there are the more natural causes that could happen to even the most innocent, careful and law-abiding citizens. Rain and potholes being a good couple of them. Just imagine driving in the rain at night and up the street is a pothole that you can barely make out. Oh, but there could be a solution to these problems to reduce car crashes! Ban all of them. A good idea on paper, but impossible to do and succeed without any car accidents ever again. Obviously you can't ban rain from open roads, and car accidents caused by drinking happens more often than not.

Alcoholic influence and texting are two very different things. Both should be banned from driving, but banning your phone completely when driving is similar to banning a couple of bottles in the back of the car and getting in trouble for that. Even though you aren't touching them or plan on using it for later use outside the car. The percentage of car accidents while drinking and driving being 28% ('Motor Vehicle Safety' by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Meanwhile, texting and driving being only 26%. A 2% difference. Still both very dangerous things. Yet drinking and driving still isn't banned completely. Yes, it's against the law, but you are allowed to drive after a couple of drinks as long as your Blood Alcohol Concentration stays at 0.08 at the maximum ('Alcohol & Drug Info: What is BAC?' by Stanford University: Office of Alcohol Policy and Education).

Phones as an entirety shouldn't be completely banned as long as alcohol isn't completely banned. Texting/messaging while driving should still be a concern, and shouldn't be reconsidered at all, but not everything is bad on a phone while driving. Coming into this new generation of drivers, it would be a good idea to start coming up with ways to possibly integrate these devices into driving tactics or the car itself. This way, it's possible to still get a use of a phone as well as lowering the car crash rate worldwide. Many cars coming up with this type of hands-free technology. Jeep being a good example of this.  ",0,263
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the United States presidential election. After reading various articles and analyzing the pros and cons of the Electoral College, I have come to the conclusion that it is the most effective and fair way to elect the President of the United States.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election. If the president were elected by popular vote, candidates would only focus on campaigning in the most populous states, ignoring the needs and concerns of smaller states. This would lead to a lack of representation for these states and their citizens.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected with a broad base of support. A candidate must win a majority of electoral votes, which means they must appeal to voters in various regions of the country. This ensures that the president is not just popular in one area, but has support from a diverse group of voters.

While some argue that the Electoral College can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote, this has only happened a few times in history. Additionally, in these cases, the candidate still had to win a majority of electoral votes, which means they had broad support across the country.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is the best way to elect the President of the United States. It ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election, and that the president is elected with broad support from across the country. I urge you to support the Electoral College and to reject any proposals to change to a popular vote system.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,264
"Okay, here's my essay:

Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this super deep statement, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it."" It's like, think about it, do we really have control over who we are and how we act? Or are we just puppets on a string, influenced by everyone and everything around us? I mean, I know I definitely don't always make the best choices, but I guess that's just who I am, right?

So, on one hand, I think it's totally possible that the people we surround ourselves with can shape us into who we are. Like, if you're hanging out with a bunch of super responsible people, you might start to become more responsible too. Or if you're always around people who are super mean, you might start to be mean too. It's like, you're learning from the people around you and absorbing their traits and behaviors.

But on the other hand, I think we also have a say in whom we want to be. Like, if you want to be a super responsible person, you can choose to do things that will help you become that way, even if your friends aren't. It's like, you have the power to make choices and shape your own character, even if you're influenced by others.

So, I think it's a mix of both. Like, we're definitely influenced by the people around us, but we also have the power to choose who we want to be and how we want to act. It's not just one or the other, it's both. And that's pretty cool, because it means we have the power to shape our own identities and become the people we want to be.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the matter. What do you guys think? Do you think we're totally at the mercy of those around us, or do we have some say in who we are? Let me know in the comments!

Bye, guys! 😃",1,265
"Dear principal,

Students should be required to perform community service because its helps them realize what the real world is like. Also, because some kids just think about themselves so if they go out and help someone less fortunate as them then they will take a whole new look on the world.

To begin with if kids do community service it will help them realize what the world is really like. For example last year I had no plan to get a job or go to college because I had no sense of what the real world is like. But then I was involved in a little program that our school does called kids in the community, and we went and did all kinds of community service, but the one memory that sticks in my mind is when we went to the soup kitchen. I was talking to some people in there and there plans as a little kid were just like mine.

It made me realize that I don't want to end up like them without a home, family, and friends I want to live in a great big home and have a great big family.

Secondly it will give the students a whole new look on the world. I know that my experience will never leave me and I will never go back to my old ways of thinking. I remember that in the seventh grade all I thought about was myself, but now all I think about is helping others and seeing what I could do for my teachers.

To sum this whole letter up I know that you will make the right decision and require the students to do at least a few hours of community service because it changed my life and I know it will change the life of a few others.  ",0,266
"Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is beneficial because it allows you to gain different perspectives on your situation or problem. Each person you talk to likely has had different experiences than you and sees the world from their unique viewpoint. By hearing what more than one person has to say, you can get a well-rounded understanding of your options rather than just one narrow view. 

For example, let's say you're debating whether to accept a new job offer or stay in your current role. If you only spoke to one friend, they may be biased based on their own career path and push you towards the choice they personally made. However, if you talked to several trusted colleagues and friends, you'd get input from people at different stages in their careers. Somebody early in their career may encourage the new opportunity for more experience, while someone more senior may advise staying put for stability. Considering opinions from multiple vantage points ensures you don't miss important factors in your decision from only seeing it one way.

Furthermore, different people are likely to point out aspects of each choice that you may not have thought of on your own. Even those close to you don't have access to your exact thoughts and likely missed key details. The more perspectives you hear, the more complete a picture you'll develop of both options. Someone could note a downside that had not occurred to you or draw a link between your situation and experiences of theirs that proved instructive. The accumulation of unique insights and feedback from varied advisers helps guarantee you make the choice fully aware of both its pros and cons. 

In conclusion, seeking counsel from multiple trusted individuals provides a well-rounded perspective that allows for a more informed decision. You gain different viewpoints, uncover factors you may have overlooked alone and end up with a clearer picture of your options to choose the best path forward. While any one person's advice could be biased or incomplete, considering input from several sources helps ensure you make the choice you'll feel most confident about in the long run.",1,267
"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering not allowing students on an athletic team participate if they have lower than a B. That is a horrible idea. The school budget is being voted down time after time, and you are considering taking hundreds of dollars out of the schools the biggest source of income? Money is not the only problem either.

When kids who care more about athletics than education have to keep their grades up they do try harder, that is true. But you can't expect these students to get nothing lower than a B. When these kids are kicked off the team for getting an above average grade they will give up on academics because they feel that they're hardest isn't good enough. If they had to get a C or above that would make more sense but to ask for all of these kids to get into honors while still participating in after school sports is absurd. Not only will this hurt the schools grade average, but it will hurt the schools' wallet!

For some sports teams you have to pay over one hundred dollars. If you threaten to kick kids off the team if they don't get a grade that would be extremely hard to obtain, they won't pay hundreds of dollars if they even think there is a possibility of being kicked off the team before they have played a lot than they won't pay! It would make more sense to put a slightly lower grade that they have to meet because than the kids will see they have a bigger chance of reaching that goal. You are on the right track but don't go overboard!

A problem that seems to be making a lot of headlines these days is out of shape kids. If we want to have any positive effect on this problem, don't take the one thing standing in the way of kids becoming unhealthy away. RELATIVE_NAME, a doctor at the department of student welfare, had a comment to add,"" Kids who don't play sports don't exercise. That is being proven more and more as kids begin to think it is more fun to stay inside than to play outside."" To keep kids healthy you must preserve sports, the only thing motivating the, to stay active.

Grades will go down, students will become unhealthy, and the school will lose money. All of these will be the result of making sports harder to stay on. Don't make a healthy, intelligent school a failure because of a bad decision!

"Did you know that the human touch is very important to the human brain? Human touch lets the brain know that you're still alive and breathing. It will let the brain know that their body will always be okay and that they are in safe hands. Without human touch, you or anyone else, could die. Students may experience enormous mental health problems, but they should at least try to participate because students will become healthier through human interactions, and they can use these activities for future references.

Any student can become healthier through small activities, here's why. These kids will become more social with each other, and they may end up making friends. Even if this activity requires the tiniest conversation, the brain is becoming more active and is not being isolated in its own thoughts. Students will come in contact with sports through this process. Sports would be a great way to become healthy. A body requires physical exercise, this will help with the vitamins that your body needs throughout the years. Students will be able to think in a more imaginative way. This opens another part of your brain which may have never been used before. This will help you imagine fun things for a ""get away"" space! Any extracurricular activity can help your students in a healthy way.

These kids will have rough times throughout their lifetime. These activities will help them through their scenario today! Students will have more experience if a future problem gets in their way. The, now grown up, student can reference their past extracurricular activity. They will be able to think more clearly and will be able to get past their real life problem. Students can use certain extracurricular activities for community service projects. In their future, community service will be very important to college applications. They can use these hours as an example for this future application. Students can think back to their activity and think about the good times that they might have had there. This will make them smile at the experience they had in high school. It will leave a permanent smile on their face whenever they think of their school. Everyone will have fun yet different scenarios they can look back on and use for future references.

Some kids might have a spiraling and out of control mental health situation. If that is a big problem, then they should not have to do the extracurricular activity. Anything having to do with mental to physical pain should be taken seriously at all times. The smallest thing may be able to bigger this emotion. If this student wants to do an activity, you should let them! Anyone with mental health and physical pain issues can try new things which includes after school activities, just take things a bit slow and see how it goes!

Students may experience mental health issues, but you should at least let them try to participate because, these students will become healthier, and they will have this for future references! Even though kids may have these issues, that doesn't mean they can't try. Anything can be healthy in its a own way, shape, and form! I think that you should make the kids at least have one after school activity but only to an extent.  ",0,269
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. People do a lot of things with cellphone, but they should never be able to use phones while driving a vehicle. There are many reasons why you shouldn't. Car crashes, running red lights, and death.

First is car crashes. Car crashes are very common, sometimes it can be because people don't know how to drive, but they are mostly caused because of people looking down at their phone instead of looking at the road. These are liabilities because you can really hurt someone or even take their life. Texting and social media are taking all the attention away from you looking at the road. Why not be smart and just put the phone down for a few minutes and just relax and drive. It can save a life

Next is running red lights. Think about all the things that can happen if you run a red light. A major ticket, a bad crash, and even a life. Just all the bad things that can happen. Just putting the phone down can prevent all the bad things that can happen to you and your loved ones. Say your driving on a major highway, maybe I-95, there is an intersection in the middle of the road, and you need to see the red light because its about to turn. If you're looking at your phone and miss the light you can cause a major disturbance in traffic.

Last is death, Think about how many people you can kill in a car crash. You're driving and you pick up your phone and miss a turn, you hit a car and that car hits 5 more cars and sets off a chain reaction, All of those people have a probability of dying because of how fast your going and how hard you hit them. Now you can be charged with murder and that gives you life in prison. So think about that before picking up your phone.

In conclusion all of this reason are why you should not be able to use your phone while driving.  ",0,270
"The President of the United States is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countries the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If It's worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.

To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Poster called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""  Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but It's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons are that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Poster is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidates share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Poster called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing President"" he says ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner.""",0,271
"It is essential for students to understand ideas and concepts, more so than to learn facts. To clarify, understanding a concept involves being able to think about it and draw meaningful connections between ideas. On the other hand, learning facts is simply the rote memorization of information. 

Though facts are important, particularly to develop an understanding of the world, ideas and concepts are more essential to success in life. For example, understanding concepts such as how to think critically or how to problem-solve is more beneficial to students than memorizing facts. Consider a student who is presented with a difficult math problem. She may be able to remember the correct calculation, but if she does not understand the underlying mathematical concepts, she will not be able to solve similar problems in the future. In this regard, it is far more beneficial for her to understand the concepts at hand, rather than simply memorizing the calculations.

Furthermore, understanding concepts can be useful beyond immediate applications. For instance, if a student learns and understands the concept of the scientific method, she will be better equipped to apply it in any field that requires research and experimentation. In contrast, if the student simply memorizes the steps of the scientific method, she is likely to forget them in the future, or not recognize when to apply them.

In addition, understanding concepts encourages critical thinking and creativity. For example, when presented with a challenging problem, a student who understands the concept may be able to develop an innovative solution, as opposed to someone who simply remembers facts. Furthermore, understanding concepts prepares students to think abstractly and draw meaningful connections between ideas. In this way, students who understand concepts will be better equipped to thrive in the ever-changing world of the 21st century. 

In conclusion, understanding concepts is significantly more important for students than learning facts. Not only does this give them a better chance of success in the future, but it also encourages critical thinking and creativity. By equipping students with these skills, we are ensuring that they have the tools necessary to address the complex challenges of the future.

"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed.  Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote.  The Electoral College is necessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated.  Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers.  This begs the question, how can a system, so old still be practical and in use today?  This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives.  According to Source 2, if this were to happen, then, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""  This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people.  If we elected the president by a popular vote, then the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election.  Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3.  ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.""  This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people.  Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system.  This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States.  According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""  If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote?  It only makes sense.  Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of whom the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" (Source 3.)  But, the information given above disproves these unveiled arguments.  If the Electoral College is such a great system, then why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election?  Will it always produce a clear winner?  What about the event of a tie?  Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary.  The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.  ",0,273
"Who knows more, the teacher or the student? That's right, most of the time teachers know more than students except a few prodigies. Teachers are individuals meant to help teach and prepare students for life. A teacher can also help get their students ready for their class by making a summer assignment. These assignments are intended to help students familiarize themselves with the upcoming course they are about to partake in and to keep their young minds active during the break. Teachers have many years of experience, and they fully understand their course and its materials. Therefore, homework given to students in the summer are more beneficial if they are made by the educators because teachers will include all necessary material the student needs to help prepare them for class; teachers will design the review so that it can be used by all students; additionally, teachers can build up or revise their review based on feedback of former students

Projects given over the summer are usually big assignments that students dread, however, digesting the contents of project can immensely benefit students because it introduces students to the information they are going to learn over the next year. Teachers who make summer assignments include the information they think is crucial for students to know before they enter the class. An example is an AP World History teacher making students memorize the locations of countries all around the world as a part of their summer assignment. By knowing locations of different countries, students can recall the general area and apply the location to the lesson they are learning about, like the capital of Constantinople and what countries surround it. Teachers may also assign vocabulary words for students to learn. The words in summer assignments are useful because when the specific vocabulary word appears in class, students who did the summer assignment will know the definition and won't get stuck, unlike those who didn't complete the review. Similarly, teachers insist that students are familiar with basic math concepts and the properties of exponents and multiplication before entering algebra 2. By knowing the information teachers ask for, students will work faster without having to pause and ask questions in class.

When teachers make the summer assignment, they create it so that all students can understand, review, and gain knowledge by finishing it. Teachers focus on all students and their way of learning during the process of developing the work; They don't focus on one specific student because that would be unfair to other students. Yes, teachers making customized review for a specific student would help the student tremendously, but that would not accommodate others because it is specific to the one student. A student-designed project would include only the information the former student remembers. Sometimes students don't remember certain crucial topics they learn in class. Establishing the fact students don't remember the whole course, they will leave the topics out of the review which in turn could affect and hurt future students. This could also mean students will create a review based on their style of learning whether it be more artistic or more reading based. Professors and teachers help their students because they have the obligation of educating, unlike students whose jobs are not to make sure other students understand the course material. In short terms, teachers focus on their students and their collective education while students focus on themselves and their individual education.

Over the years of teaching, teachers will be able to receive feedback from former students and revise or build up their review. Summer projects can be designed to focus on the topics that are harder for students as a whole to understand. Through the input of students, teachers will be able to detect the harder subject and include practice for the difficult topic in the summer assignment. Students may also suggest ways to make the review more fun or resourceful. Teachers will sort through and determine which methods of review are most abundant when it comes to the material by considering the students' recommendations. Trial and error over time will help teachers create the most effective summer assignment for students and in turn help both parties.

Summer assignments created and designed by teachers will help students and teachers themselves in the upcoming semester through the knowledge they have of their students and their learning habits. Teachers are there to help all their students and part of the way they help students is through the preparation for their upcoming course and through the review of essential skills for class. By helping their students with review, they complete a portion of their goal to make students successful in school and in life. ",0,274
"My claim for using the technology is great thing. Do you use technology every day of your life? It could help kids out by making them interested in about what they are learned. The technology could tell what old paintings of people in the old times and tell them watt hey were feeling. I think it is a great technology improvement to the world.

The FACS could help kids when they are getting board of the school work, and it could change it where they get more involved in it. The technology could make the kid do better in school if they lair then material differently that other. If a kid gets board of his work and the computer that he is working on changes the way he lairs it in a better way and a more fun way to learn the material.

The technology could tell what percent of each emotion the old painting had. Just like the Mona Lisa was feeling like she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. If we could figure out what all the paint of people and what they were feeling. This could tell us a lot about the person we were learning about.

This technology could change the life of the world. It could help us what percent of people were happy, sad, disgusted, fearful, and angry. It could tell us why we had all the war and what the Leader were thing when they started the war. This technology could figure out why we had all the problems we had in the past. The technology could change the way video games work or video surgery.

These are the reason why I think we should have the technology. People could learn different way on how to do thing and kids wouldn't get tired of school. The technology help a lot of the world and teaches them how you can use it later in life. Could learn about what past people felt and figure out what happen in the past. I don't see why people think technology ID bad because if help with everything in our life and teaches using our rescues. Would you agree with me on my claim why we should have this technology?",0,275
"Well In this part I think is good and bad idea.

I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early every day, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.

The bad things that if they're going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they're not going to do their work. In some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others' person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they work back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many, or they want their son to work. Is very different to have the people think is hard to take decision.

If they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online, is going to be easier from them because they do not have a job, or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer that's is going to be a perfect problem form them because they do not have school open, or they do not have the materials they want for learn, they have to look for job but sometimes if you're looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.

If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school there have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school every day, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.

If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer, and maybe they're going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their growth up.

If is an old is easier from them because they brain is more they can understand, and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.

So is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money, or they do not work. ",0,276
"School is the last place a student wants to be in when they've experienced a couple of rough days or even weeks and home is the first place they think about when they need comfort or rest. Similarly, not all students are carbon copies. Different students require different paces regarding social life and academics. So why would schools reject the needs of their variety of students? Students should have access to long distance learning where they will attend classes online and where they will study in a safe, familiar environment that they already perform better in as place they can focus.

Firstly, the internet and modern technology's first purpose is to make our lives better. This is the direction the today's world is headed. Teachers loath the phrase ""I forgot it at home."" But with the ease of online classes, students will not be able to use the same excuses. Teachers also will not have to worry about misplaced papers when all the materials will be conveniently saved online. But some opponents believe students will inevitably take advantage of being online, where they are prone to the temptations of plagiarism and where they can find the answer key to every worksheet they've ever been handed. But why would a student take advantage of the World Wide Web at home when they have all the time in the world to complete their assignments and where they already perform better on their homework? Stooping grades will become the first wake-up call for students taking advantage of the ease of modern technology.

Secondly, in favor of many parents and guardians, home is not only more comfortable for students, it is also much safer. Avoiding more traumatizing events of physical and verbal bullying on school grounds will significantly increase the child's chances of performing at their best in academic as well as extracurricular activities. Even with some efforts to eradicate the event of school shootings with metal detectors and other techniques, students are ultimately safer at home rather than on the schools vulnerable campus.

Some opponents say a is inevitable for a students social life to diminish when they do not have face-to-face contact with their teachers or peers. However, being at home more often will instinctively encourage students to venture out of their familiar environment and seek beneficial relationships with other students. The group video conferences that will be provided by online programs will give students the tools they need to interact with their teachers and have meaningful discussions about their academics and improvement.

Similarly, some students choose not to interact with their teachers they see on a daily basis at school on a more meaningful level where they should be developing better relationships with them. Email, video conferences, and other ways of communicating from home will provide this for students at home. Instead of constantly seeing them in school hallways and in class, the student can choose how they will develop their relationships with and get to know their teachers.

Overall, students should have access to a path of learning that is catered to them. This path should accommodate for teachers and learners ease, safety, and the students social needs. Home is the best place for a student to learn away from the school campus especially when point-blank bullying and mass shootings are taken into consideration. However, the students social life will not be diminished in any way with the aid of group video conferences. The students online academic career will reflect how they learn best. ",0,277
"The Electoral College is a ""process"" ""between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (1). The Electoral Collage was created by the founding fathers and was written in the Constitution. The Electoral Collage should be kept instead of popular vote because the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who becomes President, and it is chosen by a better educated person.

To start, the Electoral Collage helps in deciding who is going to be the President.  ""Certainty of outcome, everyone's President, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections"" (Poster). The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (18). ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (19). ""...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"" (20). ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" (21). ""The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (22).

Secondly, when voting for Electoral Collage ""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" (6). ""Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors"" (5). ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" (5).

Although the Electoral Collage sounds simple, there are some problems that occur. ""... According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage-- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (9). ""Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (10).

To conclude, the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who is becomes the President, and it is chosen by a better educated person. ""Voters in a presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election..."" (23).",0,278
"I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a good idea. There are many reasons for this. First, it is better for the environment. Livestock farming is a major cause of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution. By eating less meat, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help protect the planet.

Second, a vegetarian or vegan diet is healthier. Studies have shown that people who eat less meat have lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This is because plant-based diets are typically lower in saturated fat and cholesterol and higher in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

Finally, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can help reduce animal cruelty. Many animals are raised in cramped and unsanitary conditions, and are subjected to inhumane treatment. By choosing to eat less meat, we can reduce the demand for these products and encourage more humane farming practices.

In conclusion, I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a good idea for many reasons. It is better for the environment, healthier, and helps reduce animal cruelty. While it may be difficult to give up meat entirely, even small changes in our diet can make a big difference.",1,279
"The author of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus."" Did a bad job of supporting his claims that we should study Venus despite the danger that presents. His information was plentiful it games us a good idea on what he believes and what's happening to further their opinion. Unfourtanely it didn't provide us with enough good follow-up supports.

First off with his first and second reasons being astronomers are fascinated by Venus due to the possibility of it being it earth like previously and that's It's still has some earth like features. This is stated in paragraph four as it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" and ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Despite these good points he doesn't further it more in paragraph four he only states that it can be our nearest option for a planetary which adds nothing to the claim and doesn't a good follow up of what they said previously.

His third reason is in paragraph 8 the last paragraph, and it is""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. This is a perfect claim, but the author only follows it up with human curiosity will just lead us into equally intimidating endeavors which adds pretty much nothing in regard to his claim. Paragraph 8 is the final paragraph and it's a horrible placement to put your final reasoning.

Overall the author reasons are good, but it lacks any follow-up support to back it up. While giving information for context is great the author over did it, and it took up the majority of the paragraphs leaving no room to put some of their reasons in more early paragraphs to catch the readers' attention. Many follow up to their reasons added nothing to the authors claim making it unless information. It wouldn't have been so bad if the author had made it less an info dump and more reasoning to help their claim.",0,280
"I disagree with the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities provide many benefits, forcing participation removes student choice and can overburden some students. 

Not all students have the time or interest for extracurriculars. Some students juggle jobs, family responsibilities or intensive academic schedules that leave little room for additional commitments. Forcing activities on these students could negatively impact their stress levels and performance in other areas. It's unrealistic and unfair to expect every student to take on yet another obligation.

Extracurricular activities are most valuable and meaningful when students participate because they genuinely want to, not because they are obligated to. Forcing participation may discourage some students who lack interest or skill in any available options. They may half-heartedly join an activity just to fulfill the requirement rather than finding an activity they truly enjoy. As a result, they would not gain the full benefits of extracurricular engagement such as learning time management, developing talents and having fun. 

Instead of requiring universal participation, the school should continue to strongly encourage involvement and promote the wide variety of options available, so students can discover their own interests. The school could spotlight different activities each month and recognize top participants. For students who cannot join an activity due to other obligations, alternative ways of earning credit like volunteering could be allowed. This retains student choice while still cultivating school spirit and involvement from those who are able.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities offer numerous benefits, mandatory participation risks overburdening students and missing the key benefits of voluntary engagement. The school should focus on promoting involvement through positive encouragement rather than compulsion. This balanced approach considers individual student circumstances and respects their autonomy to participate in ways most meaningful to them.",1,281
"Imagine a classroom fill with students using their cellphones. What do you think they are really using their cellphones for? Some students do not really use their cellphones for educational purposes but use it as an excuse to wonder off and get distracted with it. Students should not be granted permission by any teacher to use their cellphones in class, it is a mistake.

A major distraction nowadays is social media. Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube have impacted the fastest generations. When teacher allow their student to use their phones most of them at times just login into Instagram or Snapchat. It can easily be proven by the amount of students that come after class and tell their teacher they could not complete their classwork. Social media can be a weapon in and out of school, it will distract students from their work.

Social media isn't the only distraction a student can have from completing class work. I've notice that student at my high school download these new games on their cellphones. When a teacher of mine tells us to pull out our cellphones to do some research, I see more than half the class flip their phones and start to play this new game called Fortnite. This game is very addictive that those students who decided to play when asked to do research, their grades dropped straight down to a failing grade. This is why allowing students to use their cellphones can be a mistake, they are failing their courses.

Texting your friends during class is the last distraction for a student. Students during class might've been waiting for so long to text their friends back. Most of the time it's really not more of a ""hey"" or ""how are you doing?"". Students really have long conversations and get carried along that they forget what they were asked to use their cellphones for. High schoolers are always just on their phones texting one another and wait until last minute or the last day an assignment is due. Texting can be the worst distraction for students and this is why they should not be allowed to use cellphones for ""educational purposes"".

In conclusion, schools should prohibit teacher granting permission to student to use cellphones during class. Cellphones can be distracted, and it will allow many students to fail courses or not complete assignments. Students spend more time on social media, games, and texting their friends more than doing homes works or even reading a book.",0,282
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Many people believe that projects should be teacher-designed but I do not. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.

First, more students will be into it. If a student does a project on their favorite movie, superhero, celebrity, etc. they will have more fun doing that. Let's say a teacher told their students to do a project on Abraham Lincoln, the students probably wouldn't be very happy about that. However, if a teacher told their students to do a project on their favorite TV show, then I'm sure that students would actually be excited about it.

Secondly, students can have fun while learning. If they did a project on their favorite movie, they could watch that movie and tell the class and teacher about all the funny, happy, and sad moments. You could also learn a lot of history by doing a project on your favorite movie, because you'll have to learn about the history on why they made the movie.

Third, they don't have to be forced into dong a boring project a teacher chooses. Nobody ever wants to write a paper on history and wars. If the students got to choose about what their project could be on it would be a lot better and easier to get a student to actually do it. If you tell a student to do a project on World War 1, chances are they won't do it, or they will put it off until the last minute. A student could actually be excited to do a project if they got to choose what it was about.

In conclusion, Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses. ",0,283
"The 'Face' in Space

The Face is a bona fide example of a natural landform. However, some people say that it is an ancient artifact that proves that there is life on Mars. Scientists have said that the Face is just another battle or Martian mesa, that the Face is just another natural landform and there isn't a face at all. It is just a common landform.

Even if the masses aren't satisfied, the Face will remain just a battle or Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Colonia, the place where the Face was found. The Face only has shadows that make it appear like a face. Conspiracy theorists say that the Face might be evidence of ancient civilization on Mars, but defenders of NASA's budget beg to differ.

Truly, the face is just a natural landform.

As the text states ""There wasn't an alien monument after all."" The passage also reads that Main sent a team to capture a more clear picture of the Face. Some said that there might have been hidden alien markings, and they were proven wrong. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to get a clear picture of the Face. As it turns out, there really wasn't an alien monument after all.

In the beginning, there was no face to begin with. The Face only had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see and here in the passage it reads ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" This shows that there wasn't a face, just an illusion.

There is the argument that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization. At the time the picture of the Face was taken, it was winter. Perhaps the alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze. Mission controllers even looked again. On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Colonia.

In conclusion, the Face turned out to be a common landform. Just another battle, another landform, another rock formation, not really a face at all. There is no evidence that there was even a civilization and there wasn't even evidence that there was life to begin with! Again, there could have been alien markings that were covered by the haze, and there could have been life on Mars. Let us face the facts though; in this reality; there isn't a face on Mars, there isn't a civilization on Mars, and it is just another landform. ",0,284
"Introduction in my opinion kids should not stay after school to do extracurricular activities. I don't think kids would be happy or satisfied about having to stay after school. A lot of kids don't have the time or energy to stay after school. In my personal bias I don't enjoy staying after school because I like to play video games with my friends.

Some kids don't enjoy staying after school

When kids stay after school they decide to make that decision, so they can stay with their friends or make friends. A lot of kids who don't stay after school do stuff outside of school they already might be participating in sports or just hanging out with their friends outside of school. What the principal offered to the students was not a popular choice with the students not all kids can draw, run or debate and think well.

Kids would get mad that they might have to stay after

Let me get into more detail about how kids would react if they had to stay after school. Kids, all over social media probably making dun of the school for deciding to make that decision. They would call it stupid and bad words because they would not be happy about that concept. The students would probably not stay after school because they would not want to stay after school

Kids have trouble making groups if you try to stay after school for a sport and try to join a group they will kick you out. Students like to exclude people that are inferior to them and relevant people. I have been through exclusion before it's not a good feeling. Being in a club that you don't know anyone makes it worse. When you have no one to make a group with its very awkward and shaming. Kids are cruel and savages there are not a lot of nice kids around.

Conclusion

In conclusion, I do not think that kids should not stay after school or forced to stay after school. In reality kids don't really care for that stuff at all. Kids can be mean and savages and can exclude people. Kids with no friends will have trouble having fun if their going to sit by themselves.",0,285
"The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because, venue have been the most like earth planet in our solar system. they believe that long ago Venus was probably cover with large oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.""Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". NASA has been thinking of many ideas to help humans explore Venus, possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray of Venus. Bump like medical hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Like a jet airplane travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the deadly ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

NASA have come up with example of tool that can help build a safe ship for human to travel to Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in Venus conditions. Mecchanical computers which is an old technology might help people explore Venus. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited on ground. Most light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

Even though Venus is the close to earth twin there are still many dangers to exploring the planet. The atmosphere contains 97 percent carbon dioxide. The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On Venus surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experience on our own planet.

The condition on Venus are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on earth. The environment would crush even a submarine diving to the deepest parts of our oceans. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any planet. High pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes. Powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. Because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore Venus more. Venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and innovation.

I think that the more NSA works together to make tool to go see MRE of Venus them they will be able to explore more anytime.",0,286
"Dear TEACHER_NAME, Principal of SCHOOL_NAME,

I believe that everyone wants to have a litter-free community where everyone can live and be safe when exposed to the conditions outdoors. School especially since it is indeed the main occasion where many students are daily spending their days at. With that being said, I would like to let you know that the world would surely be a better place if everyone would cooperate and help out the community by doing community services. When people think about community service, most people would think of punishment; something that juvenile delinquents does as a punishment. That is not the case, however. It is just something that would really help out the world and plays a major role in many lives.

My first reason why I truly believe that every child and adult should at least do some community services is because it helps out the world in a major way. Going around the block and picking up little pieces of trash or picking up bottles and recycling it really does help out. One person can truly make a major change. Your neighbors and home where you live in is the main place that should be kept clean so that you would feel safe to go out and not worry about getting sick and such.

Many kids and families in Africa for instance, however does not have a clean environmental economy. Every day they're exposed to many conditions such as diseases, bad fevers, and other conditions affecting their health. When you see how they're living, it's truly a horrible sight to see. On the other hand, America is a much more different society. When everyone cooperates and helps out, you can prevent these things from happening. Our place is much easier to clean than in Africa and all we need to do is contribute. I believe everyone has a good side to themselves even though they don't realize it.

Keeping the world clean is a great thing, but there are also some other community services that you can do. This would be things such as taking care of animals in animal shelters. Every living thing deserves respect and when you show love towards animals, it really makes them understand that even though they have been through a lot in their past, they still have a great future ahead of them. Not only is taking care of animals a great thing, but at the same time you can be having a lot of fun!

So in conclusion, TEACHER_NAME, I know that with the help of everyone from around the world and especially in our community, the world would be a better place. Whether it's from humans to animals, plants to cars, if the world was kept clean and the environment safe, having community service will enable a lot of great things in life!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME ",0,287
"Mobile phone use while driving is very common. It is widely considered very dangerous to drive while on your phone. It has been a numerous number of crashes while people have been driving and on a cellphone. Some people might feel that driving while on cellphone is okay, but it has been reported to be illegal. Overall using a cellphone increases driver's risk of causing a crash or death to a family, or person. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more crashes.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not just yourself. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cellphones whether they want to or not. Driving is a privilege and some people take it for granted.

Driving you have to be very careful with yourself and for other drivers. One minute you're here and next your gone because you were on your phone or not paying attention to the road or other drivers that driving on the other side of the road or by you. It is only a matter of seconds before you are dead and gone.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity while driving. Texting while driving is becoming a life-threatening norm for people driving. With inexperienced drivers with lack of skills, cell phones use can especially deadly for teen drivers. It has been many deaths from car crashes while on a cellphone. Adults for the most part can't ever stay of their phones, cause every time I'm driving I see it.

In conclusion because technology will change, and new distractions will be introduced parents need to take action. It isn't a good idea for you to drive while on the phone because it can cause serious danger. Also, parents should avoid calling their teen while he or she is driving. Instead, ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel attempted to answer a parent's call if received while driving. Stay off your phone while driving, it isn't safe while driving.  ",0,288
"Is it really, good if u don't use a car day to day? People in Europe have started this new trend of having different suburbs to not have cars. Now, Paris is banning driving due to smog. Also, Colombia now has a car-free day that made people bike, hike and also take buses to work making the streets have less traffic jams. The U.S., one of the most car used nations, has been going down, and in April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was the same as in January 1995. Experts are also thinking that if they encourage people to reduce the usage of cars, that it may help the greenhouse gases problem gradually.

So one suburb that is already been established and made a car-free zone is Vauban, Germany. This suburb has minimal parking spots and people have easy access to stores. A woman said,

""When I had a car I always tense. I'm much happier this way""

. This movement of making places car-free is called

""smart planning""

. ""In the U.S. the Envoirmantal Protection Agency is promoting

""car reduced""

Communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.""

In Paris, people were fined if they did not leave their car at home. This was put into place, because smog was intensifying. Also, smog is more in Paris than in any other capital in Europe. Delivery companies lost revenue, but electric cars and public transit was free of charge. After, the smog cleared the odd ruling was rescinded.

Colombia had an idea that was put into place one day and made a change in everybody. They made a program which is a car-free day which made people go hiking, biking, and they rode buses to work. It made the streets clearer. It was put into place so that it would help the reduction of smog. This program helps people to know other ways to transport themselves without cars.

The U.S. is the nation that has the most cars used. So, now they are trying to decrease the use of cars. A study showed that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. Also, people big car business are trying to help. The want to partner with telecommunications, so they can create cities with lower emissions and improved safety.",0,289
"Over many years, technology has become more and more advanced. Some of this technology has become so far that it can now detect human facial expression and determine what emotion they are expressing. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology, and it enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology can have a positive impact in school classrooms today. FACS can help improve the way students learn in schools, they way teachers teach their students, and most importantly, help teachers detect when a student is feeling confused.

One of the main positive impacts FACS can have in reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is improved the way students learn. FACS can scan the facial expressions of the students in the classroom and determined if the majority of the students are confused by the lesson the teacher is teaching. FACS could then modify the lesson in a way that students can understand it and the teacher can then further clarify the lesson the way FACS shows it. As stated in paragraph six, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", this shows how FACS can help teachers in the way they teach. This could also explain to teachers how to clarify even more the lesson to students that may be going through hard times.

Another way FACS can have a great impact in schools all around the country is by improving the way teachers teach their classrooms. FACS can detect many expressions on students in a classroom. It can detect whether a student is perplexed by lesson or simply just bored. FACS can detect which students in the classroom are bored by analyzing their facial expressions. As stated in paragraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". FACS can then provide the teacher many ways in which they can make the lesson more interesting so that students can comprehend it better and in a more fun way.

The last way in which FACS can greatly improve the teaching environment in schools is by recognizing when a student is depressed or sad. FACS can detect facial expressions on students faces and determine if they may be going through trouble or are depressed. As stated on paragraph six, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". FACS could recognize when a student is not okay so that teachers can the help those students who may need help, whether that is emotional help or help with school work. FACS could even help save lives by getting help to students who may be contemplating suicide.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be extremely valuable to schools all around the world. This computer system can help teachers improve the way they teach their classrooms by analyzing students' emotional expressions towards a certain lesson. It can help teachers by modifying their lessons in such a way so that students are not bored or confused by it. Lastly, it can help teachers know which students may be going through hard times and help those who need help.",0,290
"Dear principal,

I strongly suggest that we have an absolutely no tolerance rule for phones. Phones all over the world everywhere are starting to cause major issues i our society. They have become a huge distraction in schools, homes and even businesses.

Allowing a zero tolerance policy on cell phones I believe can path the way to success for many generations to come. If we continue to let students bring their phone to school scandalous things can happen or continue to happen. With phones in students pockets we have no clue what they could be doing during anytime let alone a test! These students can be sending answers to one another, telling people what on the test, basically anything could happen. I believe if we allow absolutely no phones this won't be happening.

Also, students could be sending inappropriate text messages. Plus with all this new and advanced technology today worse things can be done I ensure you that! Teenagers have been caught with disgusting pictures, depressing chain texts and just texts in general. This horrid thing has to be stopped this cannot go on!

So please help the community and have a zero tolerance policy cell phones. This solution I have come up with can not only help your school but everybody involved. It can help parents, teachers, board members and others. I hope this helps you on your final decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME ",0,291
"I claim that it would be better if the Electoral college would stay the same. And the reason why it should stay the same It's because the way it's been going, but it has been also having some small problems, but they are also reasons why it should stay the same.

The problem is that if you want to vote for president you can't because you are going to have to vote fora least 34 Democratic and they elect the president, not you. And the electors are the ones that are not holding public office. The other problem is that it also depends on the state you are living on because that is it depend son who picks the electors. The ones that mostly pick them are states conventions, party's central committee or even sometimes the presidential candidates themselves.

I claim that it should stay the same because of these reason, Certainty of outcome, in 2000 it was possible that the dispute over the outcome if an Electoral College vote and around the 2012's the election, Obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent and that was a lot. Also the college had to restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the MAL apportionment, with the senate decreed in the constitution. There was method that the Electoral college use and that was that to select the president that will turn off the potential voters for a candidate, there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree.

In passage 3 it says that the Electoral College has consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president and one for each member in the house of representatives plus two for your senators and the presidential election mostly is held or four yeas on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November and I think that is doing a great job one elections, electors, and on picking the president. Also that's why I think it's better if the electoral college stays the same.  ",0,292
"From Luke's point of view people should go to Seagoing Cowboys program. Because you get to go on adventures, visit many unique places, and to help the nation. In addition, in 1945 World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were in ruins. To help the nation Seagoing Cowboys had food supplies, and animals to help. You should go to Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures, visit many unique places, and to help the nation.

People should go to Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures, visit unique places, and help the nation. In addition, when you go to Seagoing Cowboys you can go on many adventures. For example, you can take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets and waters. In addition, you can also visit many unique places. In paragraph five, you can tour an excavated castle in Crete. On the other hand, the nation is in ruins from World War II, so you can help the nation. For example, Seagoing Cowboys take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas from the ruins. You should visit the Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures, visit unique places, and help the nation.

People should go to Seagoing Cowboys for three reasons. One to go on adventures. Second you can visit unique places. Finally, you can help the nation from the ruins. Seagoing Cowboys goes on adventures to different countries around the world. In addition, you can also visit unique places around the world too. Also, you can help the nation from the ruins and help animals. You should go to Seagoing Cowboys to experience new things.  ",0,293
"Driverless cars shouldn't be an option or even a car to use. Technology can fail which isn't worth risking lives over. Even though the Google car has driven more than half a million miles without a crash something can fail. These cars use post estimating sensors to control the vehicle. Imagine if one of these sensors got damaged and caused the car to go out of control. The cars seat also vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into an object. How does that give enough time to the driver to realize what is going on. And what danger the drive is in.

Car entertainment can also distract the driver if the driver has to take over. Anything can happen why should we trust technology with our lives. People also can get blamed if their car gets in an accident when that person was technically not driving the car. So who would be liable if the car did get into a crash? It's not logical to think that a car has a better reaction time than a real human being. A human can see what is going on before his or her gets in a crash. But now it's the car that irresponsible for always being aware. Have these cars been tested on different terrains? People can drive anywhere but if it's in a different place with no signal how would you drive the car? Im sure the car would need signal o drive. Some places that could shut down and you wouldn't be able to drive the car.",0,294
"Classes online sound like a good idea, I agree with this idea, but I’m also disagree for some negative reasons and problems, I also think the best way to learn is the classic way, going to the school, so the reasons to why I agree with it, can be the easy way to have more attendance of the students, because some students lose their buses, wake up late, get sick, or also they wake up tire because they also have jobs and don't go to school for that reason, also it can increase some students grades for attendances, and with the online classes they don't going to have that attendance problems, it is also positive for those students who work, because they don't have to worried about their schedules, or worried about their energy for the day, and I'm also agreed, because me as a student in some way fell more comfortable study at home; those are my reasons to why I agree, but I'm also disagreed for some others things, like the students who have problems to learn, some students needs someone to help them in some problems of the class or about other theme, and it's harder for the teacher to explain something specific from a computer, and it's easier to explain at school, in person; also some students don't have the same concentration them others, and make them study at home, can be a problem because at home they can be distracted by a lot of things, like their phone, t. v or some other electronic device; also, some students who don't take the class serious, and the teacher can't take the problem as the same way as school; those reasons take me to why I think, the best way to learn is going to school, as the classic way; teachers can explain their themes better and answer their students more easy and with better examples at school, also the student can understand the teacher more easy, and it can facilitate their work, also with that way to learn people don't have any problems from old times to now and with that way to teach big entrepreneurs came to the world; the problem of the attendance is not like a big massive problem at school, because the students who want a good education are taking their education more serious and with more effort, and try to don't have any loss class, those students who are worried of their future don't going to lose their opportunity to graduate and have a better future and became a better person with more opportunities, so finally those are the reasons to why I think the best way to learn is going to school and not with distance learning; so those are all my reasons to why I agree and disagree to the idea to have distance learning, and my personal opinion to what can be better for the students learning and my answer to why I think going to school is the better way to learn.",0,295
"The world has become extremely evolved and is now able to create software that can read every single emotion on a person's face. It can be used in several situations. From the text, the author talked about how it is used to read emotion in paintings and also read emotions of students. This emotion reading technology would be a good addition to the classroom because it could help to make sure kids are more engaged in the lessons.

Today, school can feel long and tiring. If we had emotion reading technology in schools, it would help to engage students more in the lessons. The author explained how if a student begins to show boredom during a lesson, it would be able to change it in a way to please the student. If that was added to schools, students would be able to focus more since the lesson is being tailored to that specific student. Not only will it recognize when a student is bored, but also confused. If a student gets confused during a lesson, the computer can help by repeating that part of the lesson. In a normal classroom with a teacher, you would have to stay after class to be able to get more explanation of the lesson. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" What he means by this is that people don't express their emotions by telling them to others. We don't share how we feel. We simply try to express it on our faces. A teacher wouldn't tailor the lesson to each and every person's emotion based on their facial expression. It would be impossible to tailor the lesson to a classroom of 25 students and their needs. Each student in the classroom has a different mind set. Some are able to concentrate well and pass with straight As. Others are unable to concentrate and will only pass with a C. With this new technology, we would be able to tailor the lessons so that each student is able to pass with good grades.

The technology to read facial expressions of emotion would be helpful in the classroom to help students focus more and understand their school work more. If you stop paying attention for just a second, you'll be lost for the majority of the lesson. When there is technology to read your emotions, it'll be able to understand when it needs to modify the lesson to suit the student's needs.",0,296
"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, it is only a natural landform on Mars. It is a natural landform on Mars similar to a mesa or butte. The landform only resembles a face and was not made by aliens. Scientists have examined pictures of it and concluded it has no alien decent. The Face is a landform and was not made by aliens.

The first reason the Face is a landform is that the Face is similar to an Earthen landform like a mesa or butte. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin. NASA believes this is a rock formation and not anything else. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The Mars Face is similar to Earthen landforms, that's why it can't be an alien produced object.

In 1976 the camera photos weren't as good as they are now. The photo in 1976 isn't as reliable as the 2001 photo taken. In paragraph 7 it said, ""revealing a... natural landform."" There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that this newer photo from 1998 shows more evidence than the 1976 photo. More data can be gathered from newer photos to show that the Face is a landform.

If the Face was an alien monument, then NASA would tell people of the information to get an exploration going. They would have sent out another mission to investigate the Face. It said, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" This shows that NASA was as anxious as the people to try and discover new foreign life. This is why NASA would have investigated if the Face on Mars was an alien monument But it is a landform.

Some people might say that NASA is still lying about the Martian Face being alien related. Conspiracy theorists would say things like the Face is pure evidence of alien life. In paragraph 5 it said, ""the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" The conspiracy theorists who say this is wrong because NASA has proven that it is a landform. This is why those conspiracy theorists are wrong.

The Face on Mars is a landform. It is not alien related in any way. The scientists at NASA have proven it. NASA would not lie, they need money to fund anything, so they would have to tell people. This is why The Mars Face is not alien related and is a landform.",0,297
"Society said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. But, I am totally disagreed with that because there are many people in this world that when they go to their first interview they don'tknow how to dress up for an interview, and they may not have someone to show or teach them how to act, how dress up or how important is to be on time when they have interviews or when they're going to meet someone important. It could be a girl or a boy that they're interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be.

But if they're fascinating on that boy or girl who want the job or went to meet them they may give them a second chance to make their perfect impression and that man/woman that like or want to obtain or to meet they will work really hard to get what they want, they will search or obtain information on how to be presentable or to act in their interviews or when you're meeting someone you are interesting on. For example, If I want a job that is really flexible and easy and that's my first time getting a job, and I am not know nothing about how to be dress up, how to act in front of your future boss or future or girlfriend/boyfriend and how important is to be o time because it's how it works, If you're late to an interview or a place when you will go to meet with that girl/boy they will leave, or they may not interview you. However, If explain to them what happened at the first date or interview that I wasn't presentable or on time they may give me a second chance to do it and that's where I'm going to be at least 10 0r 20 minutes before on that interview or on that date that they gave me and be presentable and known how to act in front of them. They will like it and there you will give them a second impression, and they will give you that job, or you will have the chance to meet more that air/boy that you like awful. In conclusion, there is always a second chance to show or gave people a second impression that they may not believe that you can do it.

Finally, people can not judge people at the first time, they may give them a second chance or explain to them how to do it and that way they can be successful in life, and they can make you happy if you get love each other.",0,298
"As an eighth-grade student, it is essential to start thinking about my future career options. I believe that the best way to do this is by speaking with teachers in middle school, visiting colleges, and making field trips to relevant companies.

Firstly, speaking with teachers in middle school can provide me with valuable insights into different career paths. Teachers can provide me with information about the skills and knowledge required for each career, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option. This information can help me make an informed decision about which career to pursue.

Secondly, visiting colleges can give me a better understanding of the education required for my desired career. By visiting different colleges and universities, I can learn about the different programs and courses available, as well as the admission requirements and expectations. This information can help me make an informed decision about which college to attend and which program to pursue.

Finally, making field trips to relevant companies can give me a better understanding of the day-to-day work involved in my desired career. By visiting different companies and speaking with professionals in the field, I can learn about the skills and knowledge required for each job, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option. This information can help me make an informed decision about which career to pursue.

In addition to researching career options, I also believe that ambition and hard work from a younger age can help me excel in my chosen profession. By setting high goals for myself and working hard to achieve them, I can develop the skills and knowledge required for my desired career. This can include taking challenging courses in high school, participating in extracurricular activities, and seeking out opportunities to gain experience in the field.

Overall, I believe that researching career options by speaking with teachers in middle school, visiting colleges, and making field trips to relevant companies is essential for any eighth-grade student. By taking the time to research and understand the different career paths available, I can make an informed decision about which career to pursue. Additionally, by setting high goals for myself and working hard to achieve them, I can excel in my chosen profession and achieve my full potential.",1,299
"Dear Principal,

I have noticed you were deciding to make a new policy and were deciding between allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during their own time, or not having students bringing cell-phones at all. As being a student, I think cell-phones are highly important because they are used every day for personal reasons. I strongly believe that you should allow students to bring their phones and only allow them to use their phones during their own time.

From experiences, there are many times when something last minute comes up, and you need to call a parent or guardian to see what is going on. Students with cell-phones can easily call or text their parent or guardian and find out the answer. It is a quick and simple thing to do. But if you do not have cell-phones allowed at school, you would have more students needing to use the office's phone for just the silliest little things. It would cause students to have to constantly use the office phone and would cause you to have another thing to stress about.

Another reason students should have their cell-phones is because there are certain situations when something embarrassing happens, and you would rather talk to your parents in private than having to go to the office. If you talk to your parents on a cell-phone, you can go somewhere private to talk to them. If you go to the office, anybody can go in and hear what you are saying. You can't get complete privacy and even if you talk low enough, the person on the other line might not be able to hear you.

Finally, allowing students to have cell-phones is also a way of trusting us. Taking cell-phones away will cause us to believe you don't trust us. If you have not been hearing complaints from teachers about students cheating with cell-phones, there really isn't any purpose of you having to take them away.

In conclusion, cell-phones are fairly important to the students and should be allowed in school. They are necessary for information on rides and mishaps. We should be trusted with them. If some students don't respect the rules, not everyone should be punished. That is why I think cell-phones should be allowed in school.",0,300
"""When people ask for advice, they will most likely ask multiple people"". The reason people seek for advice from multiple people is because seeking advice from one person is way too easy and by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something that's too easy and says, ""Hahaha you really thought you could do that, that's to easy you're going to have to do more if you want to do that!"" I'm getting off-topic. The reason people ask more than one person for advice is because like I said it's too easy so asking more than one person you can have different opinions, but eventually you will get they same answer more often then you have what you should do, just don't ask old people, or they will give you a story, and it will be long and boring. There you go an essay telling you how asking for help from multiple people, can give you multiple opinions and which every one you get more of the same answer and you use that one because it seemed to have worked on other people or there just lying to you and saying ""finally that kids gone"".

But as I was saying, ask multiple people for help, not just one. Asking one is just plain stupid, but asking multiple will give you multiple reasons why you should go with that answer. Think of it like this, if you ask multiple people for help with IDK ask out your crush, most of them tell you to be casual and to not get nervous, so what are you going to choose, the one that you got most of the same answer.",0,301
"Certainly there are many opinions about the Face found on Mars. Some people believe the Face was made by aliens, while other people believe it is a natural landform. I strongly believe that the Face is a natural landform because there is scientific evidence to prove that a landform could be formed on Mars and there are similar landforms like the Face on Earth.

First, there is scientific evidence that proves landforms can form on Mars.

For example, scientists have found that mountains, canals, and volcanoes have formed on Mars. Scientists have also found that Mars, like Earth, has tectonic plates. Tectonic plates cause many landforms to form when they shift and move around. If tectonic plates create landforms on Earth that no human can, it should be reasonable to think that tectonic plates can be the cause of landforms on Mars.

Secondly, Mars has similar landforms to the landforms on Earth. Just like Earth, Mars has volcanoes, mountains, and canals. Scientist have found that tectonic plates are the cause of many of the landforms we see on Earth today. For example, mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push against each other, trying to push the opposing plate underneath. If none of the plates budge, the plates will begin to push each other up tho form mountains. For canals to form, water would have to run over the land for a while and erode the rocks until a ditch forms. Even though there isn't water on Mars now, scientist have proved that water has once been on Mars. Since water and tectonic plates cause landforms on Earth, the same elements must cause landforms on Mars as well.

Even though I believe that the Face is a natural landform, many other people will disagree with that statement. Many people with opposing viewpoints from mine will say that aliens built the face. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence to even prove the existence of aliens. Secondly, the pictures from the spacecrafts show no sign of any civilization nearby the Face. On Earth, we may have ancient Pyramids that weren't formed naturally, but there were civilizations around those pyramids. Around the Face on Mars there is no sign of any villages or aliens living there. With a Bird-eye view, the face doesn't seem to have any human facial features. Only when there is a shadow, the features of a human being appear. This makes the Face seem like it was just a coincidence that it had terrestrial features. With the lack of evidence to support the claim that aliens made the Face on Mars, it is hard to believe that such an idea could be true.

In conclusion, I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because there are landforms on Earth that are the same as those on Mars and those landforms were made from tectonic plates and water. I believe that you look at the evidence provided to you before you draw any conclusions.",0,302

She was home school Kind garden through Third grade, but when she went the Generic_School, and she was put to Third grade. Before Generic_Name met me, she didn't know anyone, she had a different teacher and class.

"Phones and Driving

Cell phone use while driving has become the largest cause of automobile crashes over the last two decades. Using a phone while driving can cause distracted driving and even worse car accidents with fatalities. With drivers being distracted, it decreases their awareness on the road and leads to more car crashes. According to the United States Department of Transportation, in 2017, distracted driving claimed 3,166 lives in that year alone. Mobile phone use while driving distracts drivers in two ways; physically and cognitive distraction. Although many laws have been set in place in order for cell phone usage while driving to be banned, many ignore the law and still use cell phones. With this information being concluded, many feels as if drivers should not be able to use cellular phones while driving in any capacity.

There are many benefits from decreasing the number of drivers who choose to use their cell phone while driving.

In different states there are different cell phone law variations, but all do the same, they intend to prevent drivers from driving distractedly. Although, these laws are set in place, many do not adhere to and follow these laws. Furthermore, no state has banned the use of cell phones while driving, just adamant enforcement and strict restrictions. For example, fifteen states enforce the handheld cell-phone use law, which prohibits all drivers from using hand-held devices or cell-phones while driving. In addition to laws being put in place, if caught being on a cell-phone while driving, there are fines put in place.

On the other hand, there are many precautions that should be followed to prevent the use of cell phones while driving. Firstly, keeping your cell phone out of arm's length reach it should prevent the use of it. Secondly, if in a situation where a text message must be sent out, do it before driving and let whoever is being texted that you will be unreachable for a certain amount of minutes. Also, silencing a cell phone could be the difference in a life or death situation. Lastly, simply just keeping your focus on the road and not anything else could save a life.

Although cell-phones have detrimental effects on driving, they also have helpful factors as well. Many cell-phones have GPS systems that many people use while driving. Also, ride-share companies use cell-phones as a way to find riders and the drivers even use their cell-phones for GPS reasons. Furthermore, cell phones allow their users to make calls in the case of an emergency. For example, in the case of a serious car accident, where time is of the essence, cell phones are there for paramedics to be contacted immediately. Lastly, being able to use your cell phone while driving, permits you to be able to call authorities if they witness suspicious activity they have seen while driving.

Finally, using your cell-phone while driving has its pros and cons. More importantly, its cons. Cell phone related car accidents and fatalities continue to increase despite the legal legislative action by the states' government that prohibit specific cell phone related activities while driving. Regardless of the educational attempts about the risk of distracted driving and cell phone use to warn the public, many refuse to abide by the law. In conclusion, drivers, in any capacity should not be able to use their cell phones while driving.  ",0,305
"An old man told me once"" the future does not come to you. You go to the future"". I agree with the principal making every student do one extracurricular activity. The principal making every one do extracurricular activities is a good idea. It's a new way to make friends and have fun, and it can help find what you might want to do in your future.

Making everyone do an extracurricular activity is beneficial for the students and the school. These extracurricular activities will help people be able to make new friends because they will share a common interest. When I grew up in Generic_City from first to third grade. I did a lot of extracurricular activities .one of them were soccer. I met a couple of kids that also liked soccer too. So my friends and I would stay after school to play soccer every day.

Extra curricular activities would help us find our passion for what we want to do in the future. Extra curricular activities might help student what they want to do in their future at a very young age. People who are in journalism club might want to be a journalist in the future. People who loved since club and all the cool experiments might want to become a scientist when they grew up.

When the old man first told ""future does not come to you. You go to the future."" I was confused. Every second that passes by I go a little into the future, but now I get it. I can't expect my future dream job to just fall into my hands. I need to work to get it. In the end making everyone do extracurricular activities are beneficial. They would help us find what we wanted to do with our future and help us make new friends.",0,306
"Do you smell that? It's the smell of gasoline and exhaust fumes. Cars are taking over suburban areas. Spewing out solution and contaminating the air. There are solutions, and cities across the world are trying them.

One city that has impacted many is the city of Vauban in Germany, this city has car free streets. They were able to accomplish this by making stores and businesses walking distance. Apparently people are happier without cars, Hadron Walter (citizen of Vauban) while she was walking the streets of Vauban said,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."". Furthermore, having car free streets is also beneficial to the fitness of the citizens. Without a car you are forced to walk or ride a bike which is a form of exercise.

Vehicles are terrible for cities. Cars spew exhaust fumes that rise into the air and polite the cities. In Paris, they almost hit record high solution levels. Cars were banned until the solution level went down, smog covered the cities. The solution got trapped in the layers of the smog. The smog levels rivaled Beijing, which is the most polluted city in the world. The only way to cut down on solution is to stop using cars, or switch to hybrids and plug in cars.

Some cities are taking it days at a time. In the city Bogota, Columbia there is a day when no one is allowed to drive. In Bogota they have this one day when no one is allowed to drive, they have this day to cut down solution levels and clear the streets. Other cities have started doing the same thing. This day is very beneficial to the cities It helps decrease solution and smog levels and traffic jams. More people are riding bikes, going to parks and since more people are walking they have made broad, smooth sidewalks.

These movements are changing cities and making them healthier. Soon there will be fewer cars clean air and happier cities. So, are you ready to change.  ",0,307
"As an 8th grader, I believe that having career guides in high school is incredibly important. Research has shown that students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to pursue their dream careers. Without career guides, students may struggle to understand their options and may end up in a career that they are not passionate about.

One of the main benefits of having career guides in high school is that they help students understand their options. Career guides provide information on different careers, including job duties, salary ranges, and educational requirements. This information can help students make informed decisions about their future and can help them identify potential career paths that they may not have considered before. Additionally, career guides can help students understand the skills and qualifications needed for different careers, which can help them prepare for their future.

Students without access to career guides may struggle to understand their options and may feel lost when it comes to choosing a career. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in school, as students may feel like they are not being prepared for their future. On the other hand, students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to be motivated to learn.

To give students the opportunity to pursue the careers they want, schools can provide access to career guides, career counseling, and work-based learning experiences. This can include internships, job shadowing, and other hands-on learning experiences that allow students to gain real-world experience in their chosen career. By providing these opportunities, schools can help students gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen career.

Career guides can also help students feel excited to come to school by providing them with information on potential career paths that they may not have considered before. By exposing students to different careers, career guides can help them find something that they are passionate about and that they want to pursue. This can lead to a more engaged and motivated student body, which can have a positive impact on the entire school.

There are also examples of people who have limited access to career guides. For example, students from low-income families may not have access to the same resources as their peers",1,308
"Dear Principal,

I think the should let us use our cell phones during lunch or other free times. The reason I think this is that we might or not be able to hang out with your friends, but with our phones we could text them or call them to keep in touch with them.

Another reason why we should have cell phones is, so we can call or text our parents just in case you forgot something and to remind them to pick us up. The last reason why we should be allowed to bring our cell phones is to teach us responsibility.

The first reason why we should be allowed to bring our phones is to stay in touch with our friends when we can't hang out with them. For example, you have no classes with your friend. If you have our cell phones we could stay in touch and not lose our friendship with our friend. Another example is just in case we left something at your friend's house, and we want it back. We would text or call our friend to meet them in a certain location in order to get our stuff back.

The second reason why we should be allowed to use our phones is so could, can tell our parent(s) if they can pick us up or bring us something. For example, I forgot my homework for one of my classes. I would text or call my mom or dad during lunch to tell them to get me my requested item. Another reason is that we could remind them to pick us up. We might have forgotten to tell our mom or dad to pick us after practice or something. Then we would call them to tell them if they could pick us up after school.

The final reason is to teach us responsibility. We will be more responsible by turning our phone during classes and to use them only during lunch or other free times. Then we could become more responsible with our phone and maybe with our schoolwork. See having our cell phone could actually teach us something about responsibility.

Having our phone could actually teach us something or two about responsibility. We would also be more prepared for class. Another thing is to keep in touch with our loved ones. This is why I strongly agree to be allowed to use our phones.",0,309
" The way people behave is not always constant, and everyone's personality is not set in stone. People change as they grow and experience different events in their lives. Some people may choose to change their behavior, while others may not. It is important to be aware of the actions we take and the impact they have on our character.

As we grow older, we become more aware of the world around us and our place in it. This awareness can help us make better choices and become stronger people. However, it is also possible to become too aware and let it change us negatively. It is important to find a balance and use our experiences to become better versions of ourselves.

Some people may choose to ignore the world around them and focus only on themselves. While this may be a good thing in some cases, it can also lead to a lack of empathy and understanding for others. It is important to be aware of the impact our actions have on those around us and strive to be a positive influence.

Ultimately, the way we behave and the people we become is a result of our choices and the way we see the world. It is important to be aware of our actions and strive to become the best version of ourselves.",1,310
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number of problems that come along with trying to get information on the planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its proximity to us. Despite the author describing all the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the surrounding universe, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extraordinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible process being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenario, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to achieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us. ",0,311
"Dear Principal, 

I am writing to express my opinion on whether community service should be required for all students. While helping the community is certainly laudable, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach.

There are good intentions behind requiring community service. Helping others is an important value to instill in young people. Through service, students can gain skills and experiences that benefit their personal and academic growth. They may feel more connected to and responsible for the community as a result. 

However, forcing students to serve takes away the intrinsic motivation that comes from volunteering freely. Some may resent being told to give their time, rather than choosing to do so willingly. They may go through the motions without learning deeper life lessons. Requiring service could even have unintended negative impacts, such as students rushing through tasks or not fully engaging in meaningful ways. 

Instead of a mandate, I think a voluntary community service program would be more effective. Students who are interested can sign up to participate in opportunities that suit their schedules and interests. For those who want real-world experience or to strengthen college applications, service can help achieve their goals. But no one should be required to spend non-school hours a certain way if they do not see the value for themselves. 

A well-advertised voluntary program, in which students choose how and where to serve, would foster more positive attitudes. It allows personal growth for those who want to help, without pressuring others. In the long run, more lasting change comes from individuals who care freely, not those who are told they must care. For these reasons, I do not think community service should be mandatory for all students. A voluntary approach is preferable and will still encourage service from those motivated to help their community.",1,312
"Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, and I am a proud student attending SCHOOL_NAME. I have recently been notified about your plan to possibly require all students to do some sort of community service.

Well, you would be stupid if you didn't require it. As a child that has always been involved with community service I think it is the best way to help others and experience another world.

Students should learn to help others and help the world. This could change a lot of peoples views on life. It could make them realize they can be a good person and help out in a good way to the community. Most kids need something like this to make them feel good about themselves, and they could have fun doing it at the same time!

Maybe you could make it a requirement that you must receive 15 hours or another amount of community service by the end of 8th grade, in order to go to 9th grade. It might just work in our communities favor!

I have many ideas for community service but here are three, and I will start at something pretty simple. A day on Long Beach Island's famous beaches picking up all the garbage. It is outright disgusting to see cigarette buds on the ground.

That would help bring people to LBI.

The next idea I have for community service is a little more interesting.

Holding a buffet for homeless people so that they can enjoy a nice meal for once. Just because they don't have can't afford a home or a car doesn't mean that they can't enjoy a nice meal. They deserve it probably more than you and me.

Another community service idea is having a carnival here at the school to raise money for a certain charity or group.

I believe many people would attend, and we could raise a lot of money for someone or a bunch of people. That would really help, quite frankly any amount of community service would help, so I really hope you take my letter into your thoughts and approve of making community service a requirement.

Thank you,

"Standardized tests have been a part of school life for as long as I can remember. But are they really a good way to measure how smart we are? I don't think so.

First, standardized tests are too narrow. They only test us on a few subjects, like reading, writing, and math. But there are so many other things that we learn in school that are important too, like science, social studies, and art. How can we say that someone is smart if they're only good at a few things?

Another thing is that standardized tests don't take into account that everyone learns differently. Some people are good at taking tests, but that doesn't mean they're the smartest. Maybe they're just good at memorizing stuff, or maybe they have a good teacher who helps them prepare. That's not fair to the people who don't test well, but are still really smart in other ways.

Also, standardized tests are too stressful. We spend weeks and weeks preparing for them, and then we have to sit there for hours and answer questions. It's like, what if I have a bad day? What if I'm feeling sick? That wouldn't be a good measure of how smart I am.

Lastly, I think standardized tests are not really helping us learn. We're so focused on passing the test that we're not really thinking about what we're learning. We're just trying to memorize stuff, so we can do well on the test. That's not real learning.

So, in conclusion, I don't think standardized tests are a good way to measure how smart we are. They're too narrow, they don't take into account how people learn differently, they're too stressful, and they're not really helping us learn. We should find a better way to measure student ability, like projects or presentations, that show what we can really do.",1,314
" Limiting car usage is an effective way to reduce air pollution. According to the passage set, air pollution poses a significant threat to the health of all citizens. It is responsible for respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis, and can cause serious health issues in humans. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of air pollution and improve the overall health of our citizens.

In addition to improving air quality, limiting car usage can also help to reduce traffic congestion. According to the passage set, traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities and can cause significant delays for drivers. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get where they need to go.

There are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. According to the passage set, the cost of owning and operating a car can be significant, and many families struggle to afford it. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce the cost of transportation for families and make it more affordable for them to get where they need to go.

Finally, limiting car usage can also help to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. According to the passage set, we currently import a large amount of oil from other countries, which can put a strain on our economy and our national security. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and make our country more energy independent.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is an effective way to reduce air pollution, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. It can also help to reduce the cost of transportation for families. For these reasons, it is important for us to limit our car usage and encourage others to do the same.",1,315
"I think that students should have at least a C average to participate in sports or other activities. Even though students should have a good grade point average they might have trouble with keeping up with balancing their sports time with studying for school.

I personally have a hard time coping with my homework and sports. Practice does take a lot of time and energy, but kids don't always want to stay up all night study for a test or doing homework that isn't important to them. If they don't want to try then they can learn a better way then getting kicked off a team because they don't have a B average.

I think that teachers should limit the homework assignments to a reasonable amount. Students shouldn't have to spend all of their time doing homework and going straight to practice. Maybe if a teacher handed out packets that were always due at the end of the week and were graded for correctness students would try harder and not procrastinate till the last minute because they ""had a busy schedule last night."" Kids might even think that they're too stupid for playing sports because they might not remember plays that easily or know how to do a certain combination. Having a C average isn't that bad if you at least understand the content your supposed to, I have a B average and I still don't understand things perfectly or get good grades on all of my tests.

Seventh and eighth grades are very hard to keep up with all the activities and schoolwork. When high school comes around I think that we should have a good idea of our schedules and when we should study or practice for the big game.

Schoolwork is also very important, but kids also need time to themselves.

Schoolwork and other activities are very stressful to balance out, and I don't think that many adults realize that at all. Kids need time to themselves to relax and not be taken over by overwhelming schoolwork and sports.",0,316
"I disagree with the principal's decision to mandate that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities offer many benefits, students should have the freedom to choose how they spend their time outside the classroom.

Requiring participation in extracurriculars fails to consider important individual circumstances. Some students may need to prioritize employment, family responsibilities, or studying to maintain strong grades. Extracurricular activities demand a significant time commitment, from practices to events. This obligation could create undue stress on students juggling heavy course loads or other commitments. Additionally, not all activities suit every student. Forcing participation means students may be involved in programs that do not interest them. This less engagement and effort which undermines the goals of extracurriculars. 

Rather than mandating involvement, the school would be better off encouraging participation and facilitating opportunities for students. Promoting the beneficial impact of extracurriculars on skills like teamwork, leadership and time management may inspire more voluntary involvement. Offering a diverse selection of activities at different time slots, alongside academic support for struggling students, allows all to find options compatible with their needs and schedules. Those who do participate will likely gain more from being genuinely invested in their choice of activity. 

In conclusion, while instilling the importance of enriching education outside the classroom is admirable, requiring participation violates student independence and fail to accommodate individual circumstances. Extracurricular activities are most impactful when students personally elect to be involved. The school should focus on cultivating opportunities and interest to inspire voluntary participation rather than mandating obligations.",1,317
"People believe that the Electoral College should go, and the writer agrees with them. Whatever happened to

""We, the people...""

!? The people are to decide who gets voted in as president, or e. t. c. With the Electoral College in play,"" 
The Peoples'

"" Votes mean nothing! ...and that's just no good!

Take the

Gallop pole of 2000 for example! Al Gore, who won the popular vote, but lost the presidency, because of the Electoral vote. What the Electoral vote/College is, is a system where voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who then elect the president.

""We the people""

don't even get a say in the matter. Which is still no good!

There have been many disasters in the voting system in the past, like the one back in 1960, with Hawaii sending in two state electors

! Although arguably the biggest fiasco, back in 2000, was with the for mentioned Al Gore vs. Bush campaign.

Now, there are some contradictions in this, thoughts on keeping the Electoral system.

One example of this, is that this rarely ever happens, the most recent being the Al Gore vs. Bush campaign. Another example of a contradiction is locations, from where the candidate is from, like Romney (never thought he'd be mentioned here) having nothing to do with the areas outside the south, so he would be a bad candidate for the Electoral College.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. The Electoral College is an outdated institution that is no longer relevant in our modern society. It is time for us to move on from this undemocratic system and choose our President based on the will of the people.

There are many reasons why the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is unfair. Under the Electoral College system, a candidate can win the popular vote but still lose the election. This happened in 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush. It also happened in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost to Donald Trump. This is simply not fair to the millions of Americans who voted for the losing candidate.

Second, the Electoral College gives too much power to a few states. The current system is based on the number of electoral votes each state has, which is determined by its population. This means that states with large populations have more electoral votes than states with small populations. This gives these large states an unfair advantage in the Electoral College.

Third, the Electoral College discourages voter participation. Many people in states that are considered to be ""safe"" for one party or the other feel that their vote doesn't matter. This is because the Electoral College system is winner-take-all in most states. This means that if one candidate wins a majority of the votes in a state, they get all of that state's electoral votes. This discourages people from voting because they feel like their vote won't make a difference.

Fourth, the Electoral College is not democratic. The very idea of having a group of electors chooses the President instead of the people themselves is undemocratic. This system is based on the idea that the people are not qualified to choose their own President. This is simply not true. The people are perfectly capable of choosing their own President, and they should be allowed to do so.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why the Electoral College should be abolished. It is unfair, it gives too much power to a few states, it discourages voter participation, and it is not democratic. I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

"I believe that students would benefit from distance learning. Some students need more well focused attention and help than others. From my public school experience so far, I have witnessed kids not learning everything they need to know including myself. I believe that this happens in public schools because the teacher has two- hundred other kids to focus on as well. Online school at home could be very beneficial for students to take more opportunities and time they need to learn and understand a subject.

Video conferencing is a great idea because, not only is the student being well focused on but he/she has more time to ask questions without being laughed at. Bullying is a lot more personal and harsh these days. Students that have no motivation to get out of bed and go to school because of bullying will especially benefit from distance learning. Bullying seriously leads to students not attending school and skipping. Online school is an opportunity to prevent these issues.

Distance learning is a great idea and I think that all schools should provide this opportunity. Not only would more kids graduate, more students would have a better life in the end. Collage is a very important opportunity that every kid should be in the grasps of. Even if that means attending classes from home. I don't see why any parent or school should be against this academic opportunity.

From my point of view I have the opportunity to attend my classes from home. Myself personally I enjoy public learning and socialization. It's nice to know if I ever have any problems in public school I can transfer to distance learning. If anything it's more beneficial than it is harmful.

I don't expect everyone to agree with this particular opportunity but, it's a topic every parent should take under advisement. Especially if their child ID struggling in any way. For example physical abuse from other students does happen in public schools. Mental abuse also occurs as well. Public schools can be very challenging and hard for some students. Attending classes online from home is a great way to avoid physical and mental abuse if it is occurring.

As a student myself speaking, I hope that all guardians never shut down the idea of distance learning. I believe that any child can and will benefit from this opportunity. Some public schools are just too challenging for some kids and can be very difficult to get through. Now after stating all my points and opinions on distance learning, I hope that the idea stays open to all students and families that ever need it. ",0,320
"Today's society uses automotive vehicles almost every day. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they want to go. Smog has been building up from the cars' pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people's health, a will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportation less will help everyone an in the whole world from humans to the air we breathe, from animals to the grass they eat.

However, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an out greatly. Banning cars for a day or banning odd-numbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In France, they have banned odd-numbered an even-numbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to resting the ban for odd-numbered plate on Tuesday."" So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decreasing smog. And it also clears up congestion on the roads.

However, by using automotive transportation less it will improve people's health. Walking, skateboarding, riding bicycles, or running will all improve your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there and it would improve your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. ""In Colombia, a program took place an million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work."" That would greatly take an impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excessive for the day to improve their health.

So, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted, so it affects the grass an vegetable that animals an human consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen, so we can continue to breath. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much and also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.

In conclusion, using automotive transportation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone's health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breathe in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S. the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 and have dropped steadily since then. People are starting to drive less and less and it is greatly helping the entire world.  ",0,321
"I believe that summer projects should be student-designed. I believe that because students should be able to have fun over their break and not have to worry about what the teacher picked for them to do. Also, I believe this because sometimes teachers don't know what the students like to do or not. Lastly, what if the students went somewhere else for the break and didn't have any time in to doing it?.

I believe that students should be able to have fun and not to have to worry about what the teacher assigned them to do. I know since I'm a student myself that i wouldn't want to do a project that my teacher picked for me to do. Students should be able to pick the project them self and have fun with it.

Also, I believe this because sometimes teachers don't know what the students like to do or not. The teachers don't really get into the social life of the students, so It's hard to say what they really like to do. I know that the teachers try to do what's best for you and that they try to help out when they can, but sometimes they just don't know what is actually best for you, so they should be able to let you pick your project.

Lastly, what if the students went somewhere else for the break and didn't have time to do what the teachers asked them to do?. If the student went out of town and didn't have any of the thing that the project needs, then they're going to get a zero on it even tho they are not home all summer break. However, if the student was to pick their own project, then they would've gotten it done with the things they had on their trip.

Students should be able to pick their own summer project. They should be able to pick it because students should be having fun over break. They should also pick their project because sometimes teachers don't know what the students like to do. Also, students could go out of town during the summer and not have any of the thing the teacher wants them to do the project with. These are all the reasons why I believe that students should be able to pick their own project.  ",0,322
"I believe everyone should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of how much help you can bring other people. For example, it was right when World War II ended that the UNRWA hired Seagoing Cowboys to recover animals for the countries that were left in ruins.

"Twenty-five years ago the Viking 1 spacecraft was taking pictures of Mars, when the spacecraft got a picture of something that looked like a human face, they named it the Face. Scientist from NASA have done father research on the Face and think that it is a mesa, but others think that the Face was created by aliens. The Face on Mars is simply, a natural landform, and was not created by aliens like some people think.

When the scientist discovered the Face they were very excited because they thought it was something special, but the feeling was short-lived. The scientist figured out it was a Martian mesa, which is very common around Colonia. To better describe the Face would be to say it is: a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. A mesa is a rock formation and rocks can look like all kinds of things, even a human head.

Pictures were taken of the Face in 1976, 1998, and 2001 the resolution on the pictures getting better as technology advances. If one simply looks at the pictures they could tell that the Face is just a rock, and it was not alien-made. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time and took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original pictures, it was then that the scientist decided that the Face was a rock. The people were still in denial, so NASA set out to get more pictures in 2001. When the pictures came back it was clear that the Face was still just a mesa and was not made by aliens.

At this point the scientist were satisfied, the Face was just a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. One scientist even compared it to things on Earth. Scientist Jim Gavin said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". The Face is a mesa that was formed naturally just like a mesa on Earth. They both look the same and were not created by aliens.

The Face that was found on Mars in 1976, was not made by plans and is just a mesa that was formed naturally. Multiple pictures determined that it just happened to look like a human face and upon closer examination was not alien-made. The Face has been compared to things on Earth like a butte or a mesa multiple times. This proves that the Face was not made by aliens and is a natural Martian mesa.",0,324
"The idea of limiting the duration of those in power to five years is an interesting one. It is an attempt to ensure that power does not corrupt people excessively. There are pros and cons to this idea, and in this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument.

On the one hand, some people believe that limiting the duration of those in power to five years is a good idea. One reason for this is that it prevents people from becoming too comfortable in their positions. When people stay in power for too long, they become complacent and lose touch with the needs and desires of the people they are supposed to serve. By limiting their time in power, we can ensure that they remain motivated and responsive to the needs of the people.

Another reason why some people support this idea is that it prevents the accumulation of power by a small group of people. When people stay in power for too long, they tend to develop networks and alliances that make it difficult for others to challenge them. By limiting their time in power, we can ensure that new ideas and perspectives are brought to the table regularly. This will lead to more innovation and progress.

On the other hand, there are also arguments against this idea. One of the main arguments against it is that it takes time for people to learn their jobs properly. If people are constantly stepping down after five years, then there will be a constant turnover of people in positions of power. This could lead to a lack of continuity and stability in government, education, business, and so on.

Another argument against this idea is that it can lead to a lack of accountability. When people know that they only have five years in power, they may be tempted to take risks and make decisions that are designed to benefit them personally rather than the people they are supposed to serve. There is also the risk that people will simply be more concerned with their legacy rather than making decisions that are truly in the best interest of the people.

In conclusion, there are pros and cons to limiting the duration of those in power to five years. On the one hand, it can prevent people from becoming too comfortable in their positions and prevent the accumulation of power by a small group of people. On the other hand, it can lead to a lack of continuity and accountability. Ultimately, it is up to each individual society to decide whether this idea is worth implementing. What is important is that we continue to have discussions about how to ensure that those in power are held accountable and that they are responsive to the needs of the people they are supposed to serve.

"The use of technology such as, Facial Action Coding system, is totally necessary in the classroom setting. Claiming that"" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' "" Is an ineffective way to really, truly get through to the students. Instead of focusing on adding more technology to the classroom, maybe giving teachers a better salary and better education would help the teachers teach better, then the students would understand the material better. In the article, it says"" we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day"". If humans already have this natural ability, then adding more technology into the classroom that teacher could already be doing, is necessary and distracting. I am sure there are some upsides to this, but it really just feels like an invasion of the students' privacy. In the article is says"" ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" 
The teacher can not just modify an entire lesson because one student is confused, that is unfair to the students that understand the lesson already. Instead, the teacher could work with the student individually and help them with what they are having trouble with. All in all, adding more necessary technology into the classroom would be distracting to the students and an invasion of their privacy. The ""Facial Action Coding system"" could be useful somewhere else, just not the classroom.",0,326
"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms raises important privacy concerns that outweigh its potential benefits. While identifying students' emotional states could provide teachers insights, closely monitoring expressions risks invading students' privacy and altering natural classroom dynamics. 

This technology allows computers to catalog the subtle muscular movements that comprise human facial expressions. Proponents argue it could help teachers understand how their lessons are affecting students and adjust accordingly. Identifying boredom or confusion could help improve instruction. However, emotions are complex and personal, and constant monitoring may compromise students' sense of autonomy and security. Natural expression of feelings is important for learning and development. 

Requiring students to perform for cameras analyzing their every reaction could create unwelcome pressure. Knowing they are being watched so intimately may make some students anxious or less willing to take academic risks. Students' emotions should not be treated as data to optimize, but understood in context of their individual experiences. Teachers valuing close relationships with students can identify issues without invasive technology. 

There are also risks in over-reliance on facial expressions alone to assess learning. Students learn and process information in diverse ways, and emotions may not reliably indicate comprehension. Cultural and social differences further complicate expression analysis. Administrators must consider whether benefits outweigh potential harms to students' privacy and well-being. If utilized, strong safeguards and parental consent would be needed. Overall the drawbacks likely outweigh advantages, and teachers are best equipped to evaluate students through more human-centered means.",1,327
"I think you boys should join the seagoing cowboys. Do you now why I want you to join It's because you will have the time of your life? Then you also get to be on a bout when the waves hit the bout sometimes it fells like your riding your house. I'm going to tell you about what it is like being a sea cowboy and the appearances.

When you are on the bout you get to feed and be around the cattle all you want. Then when we guy have time to real reacts we have like table tennis tournaments and read you now stuff like that. Then You also have real good times on the bout being a sea cowboy I would say.

When you are of the bout sometimes you get to see what's in town like once I went to Venice Italy a city with streets of water. I also get to tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the Panama Canal on my way to Chine boy was it cool.

Final when we drop of the cattle and stuff we have tuns of free time when we are at sea. Once we had a fencing tournaments. When we were done with that we also got to play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals where, and we did more stuff like boxing and reading whittling and games to.

Final do you see how being a cowboy on the sea can be exciting. These are just some reasons why you should become a seagoing cowboy. Then now that you boys herd me I will be on my just think about signing up ok. Then see you boys on the docks hopefully.  ",0,328
"Yes, I do think it's a good idea for computers to read students emotions. I think it's a good idea because some students might have suicidal thoughts or might be suffering from abuse. It's always good to know what students are going through when they are sad. A lot of students doesn't like to show emotions or tell anyone about it. This Facial Action Coding system can prevent suicide.

Everyone will not think this program is safe, and is invading privacy.

But, this system can save suicidal people from all over the world. Prof. Thomas, Prof. NICU, and Prof. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Emotions can be solved like math equations with this program.

This program should be put in all computers over the world to help you with school work also. This new technology can also help you with your work like a teacher. If the computer reads that you are stressed then it could explain the question to you better or help you. This new technology program can change the world.

I believe that this program will spread on others and used by millions if this new technology is approved. This can be big help with teachers also. It could help them receive stress and give them advice or take a day off because of stress levels. It could improve humans and make them stress-free.

My inclusion is that this program can help everyone with their problems and stressful moments. I think it's a good idea to read emotions and can prevent suicide. There is not a doubt in my mind that will make me change my final answer. Your face doesn't lie, and this program will be able to tell it like a polygraph. ",0,329
"A world without an ozone. People walking place to place. No electricity. There is no fossil fuel. These are some potential, yet dramatic, long run effects of the growing car usage since the early 1950s. Limiting this could cause a better environment, more nonrenewable energy, and safer environments.

This new idea of limited car usage could improve our environment. The ozone layer is being depleted and many believe it is due to the fossil fuels being burned by cars, trains, planes, and many other types of things. If everyone did not use their car for just a few days a month, then imagine how great the atmosphere would turn out. Some people such as Hadron Walter, a new member of a ""carless"" community says that, he is much happier this way.

As many of you may know, the nonrenewable energy source, also known as fossil fuels, is slowly but surely running out. Like stated before, if we were to just not use vehicles a few days out of every month, then these resources may slowly start to build back up. We definitely would not be using as much. There is a town in Germany that does not allow car parking on the street and the usage of a vehicle is very limited. It is said that there is only the occasional distant motor sound. Imagine how much money they spend on gas. That was sarcasm.

Finally, we all know how worried everyone is about getting in a car accident, or being hit by a car, or getting 'T-boned."" Imagine being able to walk knowing in peace that there would be no accidents. Children would be able to roam the streets. The town wouldn't be as spaced out because things have to be within walking distance. IT would all be a part of something called ""smart planning.""

It would be wonderful not having to worry about danger or ozone being depleted. Knowing that an energy source would always be around would be nice too. Everyone could agree that this is a glorious idea and the turn of a new leaf, the start of a new world. A more safe and stable world. So keep them in the garage and grab that bike you bought three years ago. Start peddling.  ",0,330
"When asking for advice it is better to ask multiple people rather than one person. Asking more than person can help you because not all people have the same mind set. Sometimes if you only ask one person for advice they can give you something they think is right in that situation, but it can turn out not the right advice that you needed. But if you ask multiple people like three or four and see what the common opinion is you can take the right advice. And people tend to ask more than one people because they don't want to be provided the wrong advice. And if you are provided the wrong advice you cloud lose trust.

It is better to ask more than one person for many reasons for example if you ask one of your friends if what you should wear to a party, and they give you what they think. And then you go and see everybody there is wearing a different style than yours. But that could have been avoided if you had asked the advice of four friends, and then they could have given you the style that they thought was worn. Another example is if you ask one of your friends what you should get as a snack, and they give you a bag of chips and later on you don't like the chips. But if you had asked multiple friends what a good snack was they would have probably recommended a better snack than the chips. Or if you ask is you think you should ask somebody out, and they say yeah or if you ask some more friends and they don't think it's that great in idea to ask that person out.

The advice from a group would most likely be better than by asking one of your friends. Because if you ask one person what's in style. Then can give you some advice, and then you take their advice, and you wear it and people don't like it. Or if you need advice on what you should do in a situation, and you ask one of your close friends what they thin you should do, and they give you the wrong advice you cloud wind up doing the wrong thing in that situation. And sometimes they can lead you into the wrong things would get you in trouble. Or you cloud be put in a situation that you don't know what is right, and you take the wrong advice could have a bad reputation, or it could lead to you losing people you were close to. And you cloud hurt somebody if you do take the wrong advice which could lead to getting shamed.

And that is why asking more than one person is better than asking one person and that person only. Because no matter who you ask you're probably going to get multiple answers, but you can compare and see who has common advice. You want to ask the group so you don't get embarrassed in front of people or eat something that you don't like that isn't very popular among people. Or something you don't enjoy doing that person thinks is fun, but it is a popular opinion to people. But if you ask a handful of close friends or even just people you can see the common advice people will give of what they think they would do in your situation, and you can see that more people think something else is right rather than the one or two people who thin something else is right.",0,331
"State Senator,

I strongly believe in canceling the Electoral College. Not only does this process make us believe we are voting for the president when in reality we are just sending our votes to a bunch of electors, but it also isn't entirely trustworthy. Sometimes a voter can get confused about the elector and vote for the wrong candidate. If there happens to be a tie in the votes, the election is moved to the House of Representatives. The tie could mean that the House's selection wouldn't meet the standards to make the people happy. The Electoral College system is really unfair to its voters. This system called the winner take all system makes candidates move away from states they have no chance of winning.

The Electoral College is not fair to its voters, out of date, and irrational. Peoples arguments about it are mostly just assertions without reality on their side. I mean, why have we not changed this system yet? The votes get sent to electors, not the president. We've been using this system for a long time, it's not accurate, trustworthy, or modern. America is all about change. How are we going to change if we hold on to the same voting system? We don't.

In Hawaii 1960, two slates of electors were sent to congress. Richard Nixon luckily validated the opposing sides electors. If this happens again it can end badly. In the same year, segregationists almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with brand-new ones that were against John F. Kennedy. With this, a popular vote towards Kennedy would never have gotten to him. Also, faithless electors usually refuse to vote for their candidate and vote for whoever.

If possible, get rid of this system. History has proven that The Electoral College has to many flaws. It needs to be taken care of.

"The Park: A Treasure Trove of Opportunities and Fun

As an avid park enthusiast, I have always been amazed by the vast array of opportunities that the park provides. From a serene place for relaxation to a hub for physical activity, the park is truly a treasure trove of possibilities. However, despite its numerous benefits, the park is not visited as much as it used to be. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind this decline and discuss the importance of the park in our lives. Additionally, I will provide some ideas for fun and entertaining activities that people can do at the park.

One of the primary reasons why the park is not visited as much as before is the rise of technology. With the advent of smartphones, video games, and social media, people are increasingly opting to spend their free time indoors, glued to their screens. This shift in behavior has led to a decline in park attendance, as people no longer see the park as a viable option for leisure activities.

However, it is important to recognize the value of the park in our lives. The park provides a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It is a place where people can escape the stresses of work and school and reconnect with nature. Furthermore, the park is a valuable resource for physical activity. From playing sports to going for a walk or bike ride, the park provides ample opportunities for exercise and outdoor recreation.

In addition to its physical benefits, the park also offers a variety of mental health benefits. Spending time in nature has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and boost overall well-being. Furthermore, the park is a great place for socializing and building community. From having a picnic with friends to attending a concert or festival, the park provides a variety of opportunities for social interaction.

So, how can we encourage people to visit the park more often? One solution is to promote the park as a fun and entertaining destination. There are countless activities that people can do at the park, from playing Frisbee to having a barbecue. Additionally, the park can be transformed into a hub for creative activities, such as painting, sculpting, or photography. By highlighting the many opportunities that the park provides, we can help to rekindle people's interest in this valuable resource.",1,333
"This article tells us the technology of facial and emotion recognitions. Every day, we may walk around with expressions on our faces that shows how we feel or what you want to show others what you're feeling. Other times we put on a happy face but on the inside we're actually pretty sad. Dr. Paul is the creator for FACS (Facial Action Coding System). I am for this new way of knowing someone's emotions just looking at a picture and especially through paintings.

Dr. Paul is the creator of FACS. He was able to identify variety of emotions in one picture or painting. Beckman have found the basic emotions such as happy, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. They were also able to identify mixed feelings. Some examples of knowing what one person might be thinking. When a person raises their eyebrows they are showing that they are surprise. When a person shows that they are angry their eyebrows point inward and eyes are focused intently at someone else. When we are with our friends we are able to know what they are thinking or feeling most of the time. We know when they are happy, sad, or even excited, this technology allows us to look into it deeper. Unlike our PC computers at home, it doesn't have that advance technology that can read our expressions. In the article is saying that they would write dome simple codings to different emotions. In an environment like school it would be interesting to use this type of technology among the students. FACS would help the teachers to identify which students are paying attention and who are bored just using this.

In the painting of Mona Lisa they were able to figure that there was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguised, 6 fearful, and 2 percent anger. This technology can be helpful in many ways. It calculates emotions through movements in a picture and varies in different emotions, and are able to calculate mixed feelings. Some students go through some hard times and others may not see the things they are going through just looking at their faces. Some students are able to show the opposite emotion of what they are feeling to guard themselves and not be seen as vulnerable.  ",0,334
"I disagree with the idea that the government should not put money towards building theaters and sports stadiums. Instead, I believe that the government should focus on investing in medical care and education.

There are a few reasons why I believe this. First, medical care and education are essential for the well-being of a population. They provide the basic building blocks for a strong society. Second, medical care and education are not as expensive as theaters and sports stadiums. The government can get more bang for it's buck by investing in these areas. Finally, medical care and education are important for the future of a country. They provide opportunities for people to improve their lives and contribute to society.

In contrast, theaters and sports stadiums are not as important. They are a luxury, not a necessity. They do not have the same impact on society as medical care and education.

For these reasons, I believe that the government should focus on investing in medical care and education, not theaters and sports stadiums.

"My fellow citizens, some advantages of limiting car usage is that it's better for the earth and reduces the greenhouse effect.

Also, there won't be as much smog and there will be a lot less pollution in the air.  Limiting the usage of cars can be a better for you. Not using a car can really benefit us.

People use cars every day for everyday things.  If people cut down on the usage of cars and took the bus or even rode a bike to work it really could help the earth.  Fewer cars mean less of the greenhouse effect.  Less of the greenhouse effect means a better world.

Billions of people driving cars can really pollute the earth.  Paris had to ban driving because the smog was too great and needed to be cleared from the sky.  The smog was so serious that if you didn't leave your car at home you would get a fine.  Almost 4,000 people were fined.  Beijing, China is one of the most polluted city in the world because of smog.

If you don't take a car you could walk, bike, or skate witch could be fun.  If not then you could always take the bus and still help of the earth.  If you didn't take a car to work then it could reduce traffic.  Some people enjoy riding a bike instead of a car because it reduces stress and also reduces pollution to the earth.

Limiting car use is not only good for you but also good for the earth its self.  There could be less greenhouse effect and smog.  Let's all help and limit the usage of cars.",0,336
"There is no right or wrong answer to this question - it is entirely up to the individual's personal opinion. However, I do believe that education is a life-long process, and here are three reasons why:

1. Learning is a lifelong journey

As humans, we are constantly learning new things - whether it be about the world around us, new facts and figures, or how to do new things. This is because learning is a fundamental part of who we are, and it is something that we continue to do throughout our lives.

2. The world is constantly changing

The world is constantly changing, and with it comes new challenges and opportunities. As educators, it is our job to ensure that our students are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in a constantly-evolving world. This means that learning must also be a lifelong process, in order to keep up with the latest trends and developments.

3. Life is unpredictable

Life is unpredictable, which means that we never know what opportunities or challenges might come our way. It is therefore important to be constantly learning and upgrading our skills, in order to be prepared for anything that comes our way.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process, and there are plenty of reasons why this is the case. It is important for us to constantly be learning and upgrading our skills, in order to be prepared for the unpredictable world we live in.

"Dear me. Senator, Today I am asking for your favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. This process now consists of the selection of the electors and meeting where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of votes by the congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, but only 270 of those votes are required to elect the president. I think that we should change the way that our citizens vote. I also think that we should update how the elections are run.

First, we should change the way that our citizens vote. When we vote for a president we are actually just voting for that Elector. So there is a possibility that the Elector could vote for the opposite president and your vote basically not be put in. I think that our citizens should have enough rights that they don't have to have Elector to do the voting for them, and we can all just vote for whom we want. For instance, it could be just all politics and the Electors get paid to vote for a certain person and that's why most of the presidents who get elected today.

Secondly, We should update how the voting system works. Instead of it being 270 people out of 538, we should just have everyone one vote without Electors. Then everyone would have there say in the voting system, and then they could just average it out or figure out the math of who won by percentage. For instance, take the number of all the people who voted for both presidents and take the number of one of the presidents and divide them by each other, and multiply it times 100. Then all the political stuff wouldn't happen because everyone's vote counted. Maybe a change in the system would be a good idea.

Last but not least, In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford said that in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that vote would not have actually gone to Kennedy. So the Electors are not as reliable as everyone thought. Some Electors have also refused to vote for there parties candidate. My honest opinion is to just change the Electoral College.

In conclusion, I am writing to you me. Senator in hopes that you can fix the Electoral College and change the election to a popular vote. If this were to happen, it could make our citizens have a little more rights. We may also update our system a little so that the election voting is a little more accurate so that everyone gets to get there vote in. Maybe this could be what solves most of the political problems in the world.",0,338
"Dear Principal,

The issue of whether students should be required to perform community service is a contentious one, and I understand that there are valid arguments on both sides. However, based on my own experiences and observations, I believe that community service should be a requirement for all students.

One of the primary reasons for this is that community service provides students with opportunities to develop important life skills such as leadership, teamwork, responsibility, and empathy. For example, when I participated in a local food drive last year, I was able to work with a diverse group of people towards a common goal, and I learned how to effectively communicate and delegate tasks in order to ensure the success of the project. These skills will not only serve me well in my future academic and professional pursuits, but also in my personal life as a responsible and engaged citizen.

Furthermore, community service allows students to make meaningful contributions to their communities, which can have a positive impact on their own self-confidence and sense of purpose. For instance, when I volunteered at a local homeless shelter, I was able to witness firsthand the impact that even small acts of kindness and generosity can have on improving the lives of others. This experience not only gave me a sense of fulfillment and purpose, but also helped me to develop a greater appreciation for the privileges that I have in my life.

While I understand the objections that some students may have about the time commitment required for community service, I believe that the benefits of such activities far outweigh any inconvenience or sacrifice that may be required. Ultimately, community service is an integral part of our education as students, and I hope that you will consider making it a requirement for all future students.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the American people. In the past, the Electoral College was necessary to ensure that smaller states had a voice in the presidential election. However, in today's society, where nearly every citizen has access to the same information and resources, there is no need for the Electoral College to give smaller states an unfair advantage.

In fact, the Electoral College actually disenfranchises millions of Americans. In the last two elections, the popular vote winner has lost the Electoral College vote. This means that millions of Americans' votes have been effectively nullified.

There are several reasons why the Electoral College is unfair. First, it gives more power to voters in less populated states. For example, a voter in Wyoming has nearly six times the power of a voter in California. This is because Wyoming has three electoral votes and California has 55 electoral votes.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few ""swing states."" This is because a candidate can win the presidency by winning just a few key states, even if they lose the popular vote.

Third, the Electoral College is susceptible to fraud and abuse. In the 2000 election, for example, the outcome of the election was decided by a Supreme Court decision that many people believe was wrong.

For these reasons, I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system that no longer serves the interests of the American people.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,340

"I don't believe a technology can identify human emotions. Because I think we all fake our smiles sometimes, let's say that I don't feel good, or I am angry, but I don't anyone or anybody to know how I feel because I am pretty sure not every one of us is always ready to let people know how they are feeling, we fake our smile and still smile, but we don't really mean it, we smile outside, but we feel like crying inside, and most of the time if you come out and say how you are feeling no one will notice it except if you told them yourself, so what I am trying to say is that a computer cannot tell whether a person is happy, sad, fear, angry.

"Phone Usage While Driving

Should drivers be able to use cell phone while operating a vehicle? No, no driver should be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. The usage of cell phone while driving has been a big issue over the years. Driving is a big responsibility.

Over the years, the number of death have increased because of all the unnecessary car accidents caused by those who are driving and being on the phone. There have been many accidents some injured and some killed. People should understand that driving is a big responsibility. While operating a vehicle you need to think about those around you. Let's say, you are operating a vehicle and you on your phone texting, and you get into a car accident. Now they have to call your close ones and tell them the tragedy news. You will put your loved ones in a worried situation. Do you really want that? Honestly there should be no a reason for that to happen. Reason one you should not operate a vehicle and be on your phone.

Also, you can prevent from getting tickets or from getting your license suspended. Getting a ticket for operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone is a waste of money, a phone call, message and social media can wait. Therefore, you do not want your license to be taking away. Having a license is very import, it's the main thing you need to drive, so if they take it away you will not be able to operate a vehicle. You must know your opportunities that you have, take advantage while you can. Do not make the simple mistake to get it taken away just because you are being on your phone and being caught over and over. Those are your rights that you have, and van be taken away.

After all, operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone, have its consequences. Think about all the bad things that could happen when using a cell phone while driving. So, you can act and understand that driving is a big responsibility. Avoid getting into an accident or tickets. You have rights, and they can be taken away in a matter of a second. After everything it is very dangerous to operate a vehicle while being on the phone, make the right decision, think about yourself and those around you.

"There are valid arguments to be made both for and against extending school hours. Supporters cite the benefits of giving students more time to develop their learning and practice the skills needed for academic success. In addition, proponents argue that having more time in school allows teachers to cover more content in greater depth, giving students the opportunity to delve more deeply into the topics they are learning about. On the other hand, detractors claim that longer school hours can be detrimental to students’ physical and mental health, ultimately leading to greater burnout and decreased academic achievement. 

After giving careful consideration to the arguments on both sides, I believe that longer school hours should not be implemented. While having more time in school can provide students with opportunities to strengthen their academic skills, it can also be detrimental to their health and well-being. Studies have shown that when students have too little sleep and too much stress, their academic performance and motivation decreases. Furthermore, the mental and physical strain of extended school hours could be a contributing factor to the rising rates of anxiety and depression among teens. 

Ultimately, I believe that the best way to ensure academic success is to provide students with a balanced education that puts their mental and physical health first. This could involve shorter school hours and more optional activities such as sports and art classes, as well as providing students with access to mental health support services. By providing students with these means of support and free choice, we can ensure that their academic performance and well-being are both prioritized.",1,345

Furthermore, I believe this is wrong because the president with the majority of vote by the U.S. should win, people should be able to decide who is president, and because I think it's wrong to not give the U.S. citizens what they want.

Although electoral voting may seem good it's not because you don't really vote for your president that you want your voting for a slate of elector that pick the president they would rather have. In ""Source 2:The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defense of the system are wrong"" it states that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" From this we can see that its shouldn't be like this because the people should be able to choose the president who they voted for. Also in source 2 it states"" The single bets' argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This just show how bad electoral voting can get. So we need to change the way of voting before it gets out of hand.

After reading the passage I see another problem that electoral voting causes, which is that electoral voting is unfair to the people of the United States. It states ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" this just explain that candidate that know that they cannot win your states votes won't even bother to try.

People might feel that electoral voting is the best way to vote because we've always used it, and because it restores some balance that me be needed with larger states. But their still wrong because electoral voting has caused many problems for us in the past and how don't we know it will not cause them in the future. That why we should change our way of voting.

Electoral voting is a bad method of voting because it is unfair to people, most of the time you're not even voting for the candidate you want, and because its like of vote don't count on whether we get the president that we would like.",0,346
"Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its impact is limited. In my opinion, social media has had a profound impact on society, shaping our norms and values in various ways.

One of the primary ways in which social media has influenced society is by changing the way we communicate. Social media platforms have made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical location. However, this has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which is essential for building strong relationships and social skills. Moreover, social media has given rise to a culture of instant gratification, where people expect immediate responses and are less likely to engage in meaningful conversations.

Another significant impact of social media is its role in shaping our values and beliefs. Social media platforms are filled with curated content that often presents an idealized version of reality. This can lead to unrealistic expectations and a distorted view of the world, particularly among young people who are still forming their values and beliefs. For instance, the constant stream of images showcasing perfect bodies and beautiful lifestyles can lead to body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem.

Furthermore, social media has also had a profound impact on our political discourse. Social media platforms have made it easier for people to access information and engage in political discussions. However, this has also led to the spread of misinformation and the amplification of extreme views. Social media algorithms often prioritize sensational content, which can lead to the normalization of conspiracy theories and hate speech. This has contributed to the polarization of society and has made it more challenging to find common ground and engage in constructive political discussions.

In addition, social media has also had a significant impact on our mental health. Social media platforms are designed to be addictive, and people often find themselves spending hours scrolling through their feeds. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, the constant stream of notifications and the pressure to maintain a perfect online image can be overwhelming, particularly for young people who are still developing their coping mechanisms.

In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has made it easier for people to connect with each other and access information, it has also changed the way we communicate, shaped our values and beliefs, polarized our political discourse, and negatively impacted our mental health. It is essential for individuals and society as a whole to be aware of these impacts and to use social media responsibly. By being mindful of our social media use, we can ensure that it has a positive impact on our lives and on society as a whole.",1,347
"There are a few different ways to answer this question. The first way to answer this question is to say that it depends on the student. Some students learn better by understanding ideas and concepts, and some students learn better by learning facts. Another way to answer this question is to say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is because if students understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts, they will be able to remember the facts better. Additionally, if students understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts, they will be able to use the facts in different situations and contexts. Finally, if students understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts, they will be able to think critically and come up with their own ideas.

"Winston Churchill's famous phrase, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" emphasizes the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity. This means that success is not a destination, but rather a journey, and failure is a natural part of that journey. Failure is not a permanent setback, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. It is the courage to continue despite the challenges and setbacks that we face along the way.

Failure is an important element to consider in the pursuit of success because it helps us to identify areas where we need to improve and to develop resilience. When we fail, we are forced to confront our weaknesses and to find ways to overcome them. We also learn to be more adaptable and to handle unexpected challenges. Failure can create problems if we allow it to define us and to give up. However, if we use failure as a learning opportunity and as a motivation to work harder, we can turn it into a stepping stone towards success.

There are many examples of how failure can lead to success. One such example is the story of Thomas Edison, who failed thousands of times before he finally invented the light bulb. Each failure brought him one step closer to success, as he learned from his mistakes and refined his design. Another example is the story of J.K. Rowling, who was rejected by multiple publishers before finally finding success with her Harry Potter series. Each rejection was a setback, but it also motivated her to keep writing and to improve her work.

When facing failure, it is important to take the right steps in order to create a successful outcome. The first step is to acknowledge the failure and to learn from it. This means reflecting on what went wrong and identifying the areas where we need to improve. The second step is to set new goals and to develop a plan for achieving them. This means breaking down the goal into smaller, more manageable steps and identifying the resources and support that we need to succeed. The third step is to take action and to persevere, even in the face of setbacks and challenges. This means staying motivated and focused, and not giving up when things get tough.

In conclusion, failure is an integral part of the success process. It helps us to identify areas where we need to improve and to develop resin",1,349
"I feel like best way is working with a group is great idea because you have the chances to meet new people you don't know and have little conventions with them while working on getting ideas and finding the right response for your work on what the teacher gave as a group. Well one good reason on why working with a group is a good idea my opinion is because by working in a group you can find different details on what the teacher given what to work on in a group y'all can bring up all the information y'all came with or got from the Internet and have argument about which one should be the best answer. Another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group it's an easy way to get a better garden as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone, and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who don't, and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it.

"First impressions are an essential aspect of human interaction. They are the initial judgments that people make about each other based on their appearance, behavior, and demeanor. These judgments can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, and social norms. However, the impact of first impressions can differ from person to person, and they can be modified over time.

For example, consider a situation where two people meet for the first time at a job interview. One person may make a positive first impression by being friendly, confident, and well-prepared, while the other person may make a negative first impression by being nervous, disorganized, and unprofessional. The impact of these first impressions on the hiring decision may differ depending on the personal values and beliefs of the interviewer.

Similarly, the impact of first impressions can differ in social situations. For instance, in a group of friends, one person may make a positive first impression by being outgoing, funny, and charismatic, while another person may make a negative first impression by being quiet, reserved, and unapproachable. The impact of these first impressions on the group dynamics may differ depending on the personalities and preferences of the individuals involved.

However, first impressions are not set in stone, and they can be modified over time. For example, if the person who made a negative first impression in the job interview continues to demonstrate their skills and abilities, they may eventually make a positive impression on the hiring manager. Similarly, if the person who made a negative first impression in the group of friends continues to engage with the group and demonstrate their positive qualities, they may eventually make a positive impression on their peers.

In conclusion, the impact of first impressions can differ from person to person, and they can be modified over time. It is important to recognize that first impressions are not always accurate and can be influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of our own biases and assumptions when forming first impressions and to be open to modifying them based on new information and experiences.",1,351
"Electoral College is unfair because If you only have a couple of Democratic electors than the vote that everyone in Ohio, Alaska, South Carolina, is pointless and would only count for a couple of votes.

The fact that Electors can refuse to vote for a president and the party their on what the people picked that elector for is ridiculous, because the Elector could just pick the President on the Republican side.

Electoral Vote can be easily

Manipulated by the state legislature by ""replacing the Democratic electors with electors who would oppose the President.

If a candidate only went to a place that has a lot of electoral votes, and he knew those people were going to pick for the Democrats then he basically has a huge advantage, and if the Republican candidate got a bunch of other states with 3-6 electoral votes then it going to take him a lot more states to catch up to the Democrat who only need California to boost him up

Tremendously.

The 3 states a candidate needs most to win is

California

Texas

Florida

If the Democrats got those 3 states by 122 electoral votes.

The winner-takes-all rule is horrible, it should be however many votes that candidate had so if Mitt Romney had the most electoral votes in California it shouldn't mean that he wins all the electoral votes it should just mean that he gets the 33 votes and Obama gets the other 22 votes.

I'm in favor of either taking out Electoral votes or just making adjustments to it, so it's more fair for the people that are voting.  ",0,352
"Dear principal,

I think we should all be required to do at least 3 hours of community service. It would be a great way for everyone to get involved in their community and help others. It looks good if you have community service on your college application. This can help you with your life goals and make you a better person.

We can tell the students about this in a way that makes it sound exciting like giving examples which makes it easier. We could say,' you can clean up trash in your neighborhood with your friends'. This might make it sound more exciting if you say you can do it with a friend. They can also help out at a daycare or assisted living center with their friends too.

Some kids say that they don't have time to do community service, but they can make time. We can explain to them how they can complete their homework, do sports and other things and still do community service. We can give them tips on how to manage time and be responsible. I hope you take this letter into consideration.

"Extracurricular activities are an important part of a student's life. They provide opportunities for students to develop new skills, socialize with peers, and contribute to their communities. However, there are also potential drawbacks to participating in extracurricular activities. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of students participating in extracurricular activities and provide three real-life examples to support my ideas.

One of the main advantages of participating in extracurricular activities is that they provide opportunities for students to develop new skills. For example, being part of a school debate team can help students develop critical thinking and public speaking skills. Similarly, being part of a school science club can help students develop scientific knowledge and experimentation skills. These skills can be valuable in many areas of life, including future careers.

Another advantage of participating in extracurricular activities is that they provide opportunities for socialization. Being part of a school club or team can help students meet new people and form lasting friendships. For example, being part of a school sports team can help students develop teamwork and communication skills, as well as provide a sense of belonging and community.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to participating in extracurricular activities. One of the main disadvantages is that they can take up a lot of time. For example, being part of a school debate team can require a significant amount of time for practices, meetings, and competitions. This can be challenging for students who have other commitments, such as homework or family responsibilities.

Another disadvantage of participating in extracurricular activities is that they can be stressful. For example, being part of a school science club can be challenging for students who are not naturally inclined towards science. Similarly, being part of a school sports team can be stressful for students who are not naturally athletic. This can lead to feelings of anxiety and burnout.

In conclusion, participating in extracurricular activities can have both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, they provide opportunities for students to develop new skills and socialize with peers. On the other hand, they can take up a lot of time and be stressful. Ultimately, it is up to each individual student to decide whether the benefits of participating in extracurricular activities outweigh the",1,355
"Summer vacation has long been a staple of the school system. Every year, students look forward to the break from school before the start of summer. However, recent disputes have been raised over the benefits, or lack thereof, of this extended break. Research has shown that taking short breaks throughout the school year that range from a few days to a week or more can increase student engagement and retention, as well as give students a much-needed mental break from school. While a longer summer break may be more appealing to students for leisure, the shorter breaks throughout the school year could be beneficial in the long run. On the other hand, there are other benefits to having a longer summer with one being the ability to reset and recharge for the upcoming school year. 

Overall, it appears that having a longer summer break could provide more benefits than drawbacks. While short breaks can be advantageous during the school year, it is often more beneficial for students to have a long break to rest and prepare for the next school year. Therefore, keeping the length of the summer break the same seems to be the most beneficial decision for students.",1,356
" Car ownership is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and many countries are now implementing policies to reduce car usage. One such policy is the creation of car-free zones, where residents are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of driving. This approach has several advantages, including reducing air pollution, improving public health, and promoting sustainable transportation.

One example of a car-free zone is the German suburb of Vauban, which was completed in 2006. In this suburb, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, and residents are encouraged to use public transportation or alternative modes of transportation. As a result, 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here. This has led to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as cars are responsible for 12% of emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Another example of a car-free zone is Paris, which enforced a partial driving ban in 2014 due to high levels of smog. This ban resulted in a 60% reduction in congestion in the city, and the smog cleared enough for the ban to be lifted. Delivery companies and exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This approach has several advantages, including reducing air pollution and improving public health.

In Bogotá, Colombia, a car-free day is held annually, where residents are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of driving. This event has seen a significant increase in participation, with over 7 million people participating in 2019. This approach has several advantages, including reducing air pollution, improving public health, and promoting sustainable transportation.

However, some may argue that car ownership is necessary for certain jobs or activities, such as delivery or transportation of goods. While this may be true, there are alternative modes of transportation available, such as electric vehicles or bicycles, which can be used for certain tasks. Additionally, many cities are now implementing bike-sharing programs and improving public transportation infrastructure to make alternative modes of transportation more accessible.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including reducing air pollution, improving public health, and promoting sustainable transportation. While car ownership may be necessary for certain jobs or activities, there are alternative modes of transportation available, and many cities are now implementing policies to make alternative modes of transportation more accessible. By reducing car usage, we can work towards a more sustainable future and reduce our impact on the environment.",1,357
"The voters of America do not vote for a president; they vote for a slate of electors who then elect a president. The Electoral College is the process of voters relying on a slate of electors to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice, though they cannot always guarantee who the electors will vote for. The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote for the president because it is a non-democratic method since voters do not get to vote for a president directly, even though the outcome is almost always in the favor of the voter.

The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of voting because voters only get to vote for a slate of electors, not the president of their choice. Although it is rare for an elector to vote for the president that is not the first choice of the people who elected him, it has happened. The Electoral College is also unfair because in the system, the ""winner takes all"". This is unfair because nominees only spend their time campaigning in the ""swing states"" that will get them the most votes. In these states, some voters know they have no chance of getting the president they wish to elect if the majority of the state chooses to elect the other candidate.

"In the modern world, young people are often criticized for not giving enough time to helping their communities. While this may be true in some cases, I believe that many young people are actively engaged in various community service activities. In this essay, I will argue that young people do, in fact, contribute significantly to their communities and that this contribution is essential for the betterment of society.

Firstly, young people are often involved in volunteer work, which is a significant form of community service. Many young people volunteer at local charities, hospitals, and schools, where they provide valuable services to the community. For example, they may help to organize events, provide support to those in need, or assist with fundraising efforts. These activities are essential for building stronger communities and improving the lives of those who live in them.

Secondly, young people are often at the forefront of social and environmental activism. They are passionate about issues such as climate change, social justice, and human rights, and they work tirelessly to raise awareness and effect change. For instance, young people have been instrumental in organizing protests, marches, and rallies to raise awareness about issues such as gun control, police brutality, and racial inequality. They have also been active in promoting sustainability and reducing waste by participating in initiatives such as beach cleanups and tree planting campaigns.

Finally, young people are often involved in mentoring and tutoring programs, which are critical for the development of future generations. Many young people volunteer their time to help children and teenagers with their studies, providing them with the support and guidance they need to succeed. These programs are essential for building stronger communities and ensuring that young people have the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in life.

In conclusion, while it is true that some young people may not give enough time to helping their communities, I believe that the majority of young people are actively engaged in various community service activities. They volunteer their time, participate in social and environmental activism, and mentor and tutor younger generations. These contributions are essential for building stronger communities and improving the lives of those who live in them. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and support the efforts of young people in their communities.

"Dear State Senator, 12315 I have a very strongly worded, persuasive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways' president's become elected, but it's serving an injustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College. I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in. What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a ""winner take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential candidate."" The winner take all system is not a fair way to elect a president because of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largely populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to California or Texas because those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campaign for a certain candidate. According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candidates focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.

My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is because it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, because it does allow the people to vote for the president or candidate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is because most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More precisely 60 percent of voters to don't want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If the majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?

In conclusion, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly operations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2. I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College First, the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or causes many disruptions in our country.",0,360
"Degree certificates are widely recognized as a measure of one's academic achievements and knowledge. However, if this tendency goes to the extreme, young people may be misled into believing that a degree certificate is the only factor that determines their success in life.

To begin with, a degree certificate is not a reliable indicator of one's ability to perform in the workplace. It is true that a degree certificate can demonstrate one's academic achievements, but it cannot reflect one's practical skills, such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. These skills are essential for success in the workplace, and they cannot be acquired through academic studies alone. For example, a person who has a degree in engineering may not be able to perform well in the workplace if he or she lacks the necessary practical skills.

Furthermore, a degree certificate does not guarantee success in life. It is true that having a degree can open doors to many opportunities, but it does not guarantee success. A person may have a degree, but he or she may still fail to achieve success due to other factors, such as lack of experience, poor networking skills, or lack of motivation. For example, a person who has a degree in business may not be able to find a job if he or she lacks the necessary experience or networking skills.

In conclusion, while a degree certificate can be a useful indicator of one's academic achievements, it is not the only factor that determines one's success in life. A degree certificate cannot reflect one's practical skills or guarantee success in life. Therefore, young people should not be misled into believing that a degree certificate is the only factor that determines their success in life.

So in this essay I'm going to tell you what all happens in the court system such as how presidents get choose, thus the time that presidents are choose. Also, I will be telling what else there is in the government

In the United States we have a president and how president is in charge of the country and what happens. He or she is in charge of what happens in other countries that can deal or harm us. So far in history we have had 44 presidents. Some presidents have done a lot more for this country than others have. Presidents are choose every four years by voting. The people that live in the country vote out of dozens of people who nominate themselves as president. Then they narrow down to 2 people, and they count the votes from there and that is how the presidents get choose

"I think that education is a life-long process. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is that education is a never-ending process. As long as you are learning, you are progressing. This is especially true when it comes to learning new things.

One of the best examples of this is when you are learning how to play a new sport. At first, you might only be able to do a few simple things. But as you continue to practice and learn, you will eventually be able to do more complex things. This is also true with education.

"Have you ever wondered why we, American people don't get to choose our electors? I always ask my self that question and never know why. In my opinion I think that the election should be by popular vote by the American citizens. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair to voters and irrational.

The first reason why the electoral college is absurd is that it is not fair. It has a winner-take- all system in each state. Candidates don't spend time in states that have no chance of winning. Into that, the article"" 
The Indefensible Electoral college

"" states"" 
State legislatures are currently responsible for choosing the electors

"". So technically they give us a category of presidents to choose from!

The last the second and final reason is it is irrational. Although the founding fathers of the countries established the electoral college, that doesn't mean It's still valid. There have been many mistakes and disasters in the previous years. In the same article it says ""over sixty percent of the vote would prefer a direct election over the one we have now"". This proves that I'm not the only one who disagrees on the electoral college.

It makes sense why people will actually like the electoral college. Considering that it is an easier way for us to vote and takes less time. However, a direct election really gives us the freedom that American people deserve. What is the point of voting for a president when you don't have the freedom to vote for the one you want?  ",0,364
"As time goes by, many technological advances come about and many change the world we live in. Within a few years there have been many new inventions that have completely revolutionized the way we live. Some people like the new ideas that are brought up and some don't.

Many do not want to have one of these cars and the developers are trying to find ways to improve them. As they continue to test them and see if they are ready to be sold to the public, the public can only wait and see how this will turn out.

Vehicles have been improved year by year and there always seems to be a new model that comes out and is said to be the 'best' that has ever been made. The people want them and no matter what, there are always some things that bug the owners. As new models come out, the prices of the vehicles go up. Just imagine the price of a new car that is able to drive itself. We have no idea how the cars will affect our everyday life and what changes it will bring as well. I personally believe that these brand-new cars will not be a good thing to have. It could cause anger, and we could only imagine the price to get one repaired if it were to be in some sort of accident. With a slow limited speed, it would cause the other drivers on the road who drive normal cars to be very aggravated. The weather also brings up a new con in the public's mind as we wonder how the car will run in something such as snow or heavy rain. The car is drives itself until it reaches things like moving past an accident and moving through work zones. It may have the driver bored out of their mind, waiting for their turn on the wheel and has people wondering if others are able to be in the car with them. Could the car cause accidents and will be available to all who are able to afford it? There are so many new ideas that can have positive and very negative affects.

There are still many questions that stay in our heads that we want to be answered. The car still has some time until it is publically released, but we are all anxious to see what this vehicle will do to our lives.  ",0,365
"I believe, the schools which ones offer distance classes for students is a perfect option fora lot of people for a several reason.

Some persons want to finish carriers of schools, but they can't for these reasons.

- They do not have much time to do it,

because they have to work, pay bills and stuff like that.

-Some students get out of the schools because they want to help their family, and pass more time with them; take caring of they younger bothers, sister, or work to get many into their house.

Taking classes at home will be the better options for the students which ones want to continue their carrier after high school, into the university, becasuse they can have a time to work, and to pay they carrier, and to get done what they wants to be and their future ...

Some carriers are really expensive, and a parents can't pay for it. Well the students can work and get many. And the same time with these programs they can still continue with my class.

Also begin home taking a class, should be a better more concentration and relaxing eating an apple, least worries and getting ready for a better future. Doing classes work and the free time and having time to do others staff.

Classes a distance, will be the better option fora lot of peoples, they can have time to do many things done at the same time.

Work, take of they kid, have time free for your own and, with their family. Taking a class at home are the best way for those peoples want to finish they carriers in Universities or High Schools.",0,366
"Dear principle

I believe that the first policy is the better one to allow. I think that the first policy is better because kids should be able to have there phones just in case of emergency. Furthermore, I also think kids should have there phones because if you're at lunch you should be able to use you're phoned. And the last reason I think the first policy is better is that you can IOUs them for math.

The first reason think you should be able to have your phone in school is in case of and emergency. For example if you have to catch the bus home. Another example is if you have to go to a friends house. And lastly is because your parents might need to contact you.

My second reason I think that the first policy is better is because if you're going to be at lunch or free time you're not going to be doing any work. For example, you can play a game on your phone. Another example is you can text your friends that might be on the other side of the lunchroom. And the last example is so that you can make a phone call

The last reason that I think that the first policy is better is because you could use them for math. For example if you need to use the calculator. Another example is so that you can put your notes that you take in class and put them in your phone. The last example is so that you can play with is when you're done your test.

As you can see I clearly believe that the first policy is better than the second policy.",0,367
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving us an idea of what NASA is working on to get around the danger, giving us reasons why Venus is a sister planet to the Earth, and by showing us some key items that we could research. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size. It is often referred to as Earth's twin because of this. However, there are some dangers to exploring the planet more in depth.

The author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" The author put this piece of information in to show that we should do more research to show that life once existed on Venus. This planet could hold forms of life, but we don't have any research to prove it. Going to Venus, despite the dangers, would give us more evidence or materials to prove that Venus is even more or less similar to Earth, This would also help us understand our solar system more as a whole.

The author states, ""NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" The author put this piece of information in to prove that NASA is trying to come up with possible solutions to explore Venus. However, they aren't working out so well as a vehicle like this would prevent them from collecting any rocks or gases to bring back and research. Studying Venus could lead to an abundance of solar power and the radiation would be minimal.

The vehicle NASA is planning will not allow researchers to take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else or that matter. The author states, ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This is to explain that the dangers of going to Venus far outweigh the safety. There is lots of research to still be done on Venus.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving us an idea of what NASA is working on to get around the danger, giving us reason why Venus is a sister planet to the Earth, and by showing us some key items that we could research. The author states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author put that piece of information in to explain that the dangers are worth it.",0,368
"Dear Principle,

I am writing a letter to you because I want to talk to you about what I think our school should do about having community service. I think that having community service should be put into school because it's good for high school as a credit, helps the earth environment, and makes the school go green about things.

When we all go to high school they want us to enter the school with community service done so that we help the community more and to have it as a credit. For example : we can attend and help the old people at a resting home or help at a local library to show that we have done our hours for school and that we have dedicated to something by helping the community. Teachers would probably like that quality in a kid, so they would put you in a advanced class since they see that you are smart and dedicated to do something as you are told to do so.

Doing community service can also help the earth. Our earth has been going threw a difficult time because of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and doing some community service can help it a lot. Like going to the beach and picking up the garbage left on the sand, or picking up trash left on the streets stuff like that would be perfect. Our global warming is getting awful and doing community service shows that you care for the earth, and you are willing to do something to save it.

Also, when doing all of this community service the school will be known as a going green school. We can have recycled paper and bottles to show that we go green for the earth and so that we try to cut down on killing trees. Having all of this may make the school more popular because parents would want that since its better for there child education and learning process for their kids to know more about the community, our planet earth, and how to help it in many ways.

Well thank you for your time, I hope that you take this opportunity and try it because doing so can really make a difference for the environment, community, and the school.

Sincerely your student,

"I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because it's a fair way to elect the President of the United States. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final decision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law vary show many are selected. The presidential election is held every four Pearson the Tuesday after the first Monday of November.

The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the district of Columbia. You can help choose your states electors when you vote for president. Even though you're voting for your candidate you're really voting for the candidates electors. Most states have a winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of your candidates who ran for president in your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state at the meeting of the electors in December. Then the certificate is sent to the congress and the national records of the presidential election.  ",0,370
"Many people are in belief of evaporating the idea of having the Electoral college. A Gallop poll taken in 2000 shows that citizens would rather have a direct election. As a member of the United States you must think of all the possibilities. Yes, the electoral college was once a great process, but now there are some changes are in need of being made.

The electoral college is a process in which we select electors. This long and dragged out procedure is many steps that take months to prepare for. First, there must be a selection of the electors which are chosen by the states. Then the meeting must be planed and taken place. Who and why is a hard aspect to decide on voting day for those who have been chosen to be the electors. Votes for president and Vice President must be made. After voting the counting beings. The Electoral College has a total of 538 members. Over 270 votes must be made to elect the President. This process can easily be shortened by using a direct election.

By having a direct election everyone's voice is heard. This means less arguing in the states. Citizens enjoying believing their thoughts are not being avoided. Having the Electoral College taking place is highly unwanted in the US. This is because the people believe a direct vote is more efficient way for them to show who they believe is worthy of being President and Vice President.

Each candidate running for office retains a group of electors from a state. These electors are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. This means if a person doesn't like the electors chosen they feel like they still don't have a say of what is going on in the presidential election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College is no longer a process citizens enjoy. This procedure is too long and citizens don't encourage it. Many people believe that this branch of government feels they will lose more power if the Electoral College is given up on. Using a direct election will spare the arguments and will allow us to have an easy and manageable process in which to vote on our leading man.",0,371

"When it comes to important matters in life, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be a valuable resource. However, there are also potential drawbacks to relying solely on the opinions of others. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of seeking guidance from experts and authorities for important matters in life.

One of the main advantages of seeking guidance from experts is that they have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be valuable in making informed decisions. Experts can provide insights and perspectives that may not be immediately obvious to the average person, and can help individuals navigate complex issues with greater ease. Additionally, experts can often provide guidance on how to avoid common mistakes and pitfalls, which can save time and resources in the long run.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to relying solely on the opinions of experts. For example, experts may not always have a complete understanding of the individual's unique circumstances and needs. This can lead to incorrect advice or recommendations that may not be the best fit for the individual. Additionally, experts may be biased or have a vested interest in certain outcomes, which can lead to conflicts of interest and potential harm to the individual.

Another potential disadvantage of seeking guidance from experts is that it can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. When individuals rely too heavily on the opinions of others, they may not take the time to think critically and make decisions based on their own values and beliefs. This can lead to a lack of complete understanding of one's life, and can make it difficult to navigate complex issues in the future.

On the other hand, making mistakes can be a valuable learning experience. When individuals make mistakes, they have the opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and learn from their experiences. This can help individuals develop critical thinking skills and become more resilient in the face of challenges. Additionally, making mistakes can lead to personal growth and development, as individuals learn to take responsibility for their actions and make better decisions in the future.

In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be a valuable resource for important matters in life. However, it is important to be aware of the potential drawbacks and to approach guidance with a critical eye. By considering the pros and cons of seeking guidance, individuals can make informed decisions that balance the need for expertise with the importance of personal growth and development.",1,373
"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in schools is a great idea.

Teachers always want to know if you understand the lessons and objectives they are teaching you.

If you're anything like me then you will just act like you know what's going on because you don't want to ask any questions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand each others emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

If teachers had the Facial Action Coding System device on hand they could easily see how the students are feeling about a particular lesson.

This would work well for the students that don't share their opinions in the classroom or at all.

If students did not understand a lesson the emotion reading device could show the teacher how the students are feeling.

If the device shows students are confused or bored, the teacher could modify the lesson to better the students and increase their knowledge capacity and possibly make it more entertaining.

The technology could also help the teenagers express how they truly feel because some teenagers are hard to read.

Some teens, like myself, have a resting face that makes me look angry at the world and unapproachable.

I think a device like this would show that some peers are not as angry or upset as their resting face shows.

Also, most communication takes place over technology nowadays.

Personally, my school has laptops and I think it would be great if the software was on our devices because emotions play a huge role in everyone's lives.

This software would also help numerous school guidance counselors across the globe because they deal with all sorts of emotions every day.

I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be extremely helpful.

The technology has the intelligence to identify mixed emotions which is helpful because most people have trouble perceiving facial traits and expressions.

If my school had this software, I would be all over it trying to find out how I feel because sometimes I don't even know my own emotions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand each others emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

I think using the Facial Action Coding System software on our school computers is brilliant idea, and I personally think my peers would test it out in a heartbeat.

There are numerous benefits and positive outcomes from using this software in a classroom. ",0,374
"Drivers cars are coming! Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a future with a public transportation system. He envisions fleets of diverless cars form a public-transport system. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world. Although everything seems good, there are some bad things about these cars too. Questions like who would be responsible if they crash, what happens when dealing with complicated traffic or road construction. Driverless cars is it really a good thing?

Driverless cars may act all good but are the really? Driverless cars would put way too many jobs out the window, taxi services, truck driving services, limo services they would all lose their jobs. Everyone would be out of work. They would all get replaced by technology. We would have a big unemployment rate. How do you know they might not malfunction and crash, you are putting your live and everyone in the cars' life on the line too. The cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but still need human skills.

Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Many states will not test computer-driven cars for safety reasons. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault? The car, the car should have the newest technology to drive anywhere and to be safe. Releases for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. What happens to the other 10? These cars aren't safe.

Driverless cars good or bad thing? Cars without drivers is a bad thing. So many things can go wrong the technology can fail anything. This is why we have laws to say it is only safe for a human driver to be driving at all times. People who make them will need a lot of responsibility to make these cars not have any problems, so they don't ruin lives.  ",0,375
"Experiments and new ideas are paving the way for new cultural changes. Cars are emitting more and more pollution every year. Researchers and studies show that by limiting the use of motorized vehicles the harmful gases trapped inside the ozone will eventually diminish.

In Vauban, Germany they have given up theirs cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in THS experimental new district"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal. According to the article, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not even own a car, and 57 percent sold their car just so they could move into this suburban lifestyle.

Paris, France decided to give this experiment a try. After five days France recorded that 60 percent of the capitals' congestion went down. This has made more clear skies and easier breathing habits for residents.

The United States is now thinking about trying this new change. Researches say that since the recession not many people are buying cars nowadays. They don't have a need for them as much as they did before. Numbers have been going down steadily since 2005. ""If this pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal.

"Nowadays, many people can see lots of advertisements. Some of them are good, some are bad, but most of the time, the advertisements are not very good. The reason for this is that most people do not know how to evaluate the quality of an advertisement. They just see the advertisement and think that it is good or bad. This is not a good way to make a decision. If you want to know the truth, you have to do some research. You need to find out what the advertiser is trying to sell you, and what you are willing to pay for it. In this article, I am going to show you how you can do just that.

How to Evaluate the Quality of a Product Advertisements are a very effective way of getting people to buy a product. However, they can also be very misleading. For example, if you see an ad that says that a new car will save you a lot of money in the long run, do you really think you will buy it? Of course not. Most people would not be able to afford such a car even if it was offered at a low price. So, what is the point of advertising? The point is to get people interested in buying the product and to convince them that they will be happy with it once they have it in their hands. Unfortunately, this does not always work. Sometimes, people just don't like the idea of buying something that is too good to be true. That is why you should always do your research before you buy anything. Here are some tips to help you make an informed decision: 1. Read the fine print. 2. Look at the pictures. 3. Check the warranty. 4. Ask for a price comparison. 5. Make sure you understand the terms and conditions. 6. Don't be afraid to ask questions. 7. Do your homework. 8. Take a look at other people's reviews. 9. Compare the price of similar products. 10. Try to compare the features of different brands. 11. Find out how long the manufacturer has been in business. 12. Learn about the company's history. 13. Get a feel for the brand's reputation. 14. See if there are any complaints about it on the Internet. 15. Talk to your friends and family. 16

I think that students should be allowed to bring there phones to school and use them at free times. I believe This is a good idea because kids don't have anything to do and their would more than likely get themselves in trouble for doing something they would not have if they had something to do. Also what if there is a family problem like if somehow the house went up in flame the kid who lived in that house would know before other people. Or what if the school was on fire the kid would than be able to call the mom or dad and let them know that the kid is okay. Another reason that it is a good idea is because kids tend to listen more when they are happy and phone to say something to your friend across the lunchroom is a grate way to keep the kid happy for the rest of the day. On the other hand the kids might be to in to the phone to tern it off for class if this happens a teacher can take it away from the kids that are not following the rules of the school. So I say we should have phones in school just not during class. Thank you for listening to what I had to say about the phone debate that our school is having. I hope you see that having phone in school is a great idea and plan.,0,378
"Many people believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens. These people are called theorist. Theorist are people who give accusations without any supportive details.

We actually support our theories, like the face on Mars.

When the first image of the ""face on Mars"" was released in 1976 it became a pop icon. People believed it was alien made and think there is alien structures on the planet.

"As the world becomes more accessible, the number of travel options available to us is increasing. From solo travel to group tours led by a tour guide, there are many ways to explore the world. While some may argue that traveling alone is the best way to experience new cultures, I believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. In this essay, I will explain why I believe this to be true.

Firstly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a great way to meet new people. When you travel alone, you are limited to the people you meet along the way. However, when you travel in a group, you have the opportunity to meet people from all over the world who share your passion for travel. This can lead to lifelong friendships and connections that you would not have made otherwise.

Secondly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can be safer than traveling alone. When you are in a foreign country, it can be easy to get lost or find yourself in an unsafe situation. However, when you are part of a group led by a tour guide, you have someone who knows the area and can help you navigate any potential dangers. Additionally, tour guides are often trained in first aid and can provide assistance in case of an emergency.

Thirdly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can be more efficient than traveling alone. When you travel alone, you are responsible for planning your itinerary, booking your accommodations, and navigating your way around a new city or country. This can be time-consuming and stressful. However, when you travel in a group led by a tour guide, many of these details are taken care of for you. This allows you to focus on enjoying your trip and experiencing new things.

Finally, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can provide you with a more immersive cultural experience. Tour guides are often locals who know the area well and can provide you with insights into the local culture that you would not have otherwise. They can take you to local restaurants, introduce you to local customs, and help you understand the history and significance of the places you are visiting.

In conclusion, while some may argue that traveling alone is the best way to experience new cultures, I believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. Not only does it provide you with the opportunity to meet new people, but it can also be safer, more efficient, and provide you with a more immersive cultural experience. So, the next time you are planning a trip, consider joining a group tour led by a tour guide. You may be surprised at how much you enjoy it.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the pros and cons of businesses and schools instituting a 4-day, 10 hour work/school week, written from the perspective of an average 8th grade student:

Pros of a 4-day, 10 hour work week:

I think that businesses and schools should consider implementing a 4-day, 10 hour work/school week because it would be really cool for people to have more time off to do things they enjoy. Like, imagine having an extra day to hang out with friends, go to the beach, or play video games. It would be so much fun! Plus, it would give people more time to relax and recharge, which would make them way more productive when they are at work or school.

Another pro is that it would help the environment. With fewer days in the workweek, there would be less traffic and pollution from people commuting to work. And, since schools would also be closed one day, there would be less energy used for heating and cooling buildings. It's like, a win-win for the planet!

Cons of a 4-day, 10 hour work week:

But, there are also some cons to consider. One of them is that businesses might not make as much money if they are only open four days a week. Like, if a store is only open four days, they might not sell as many things. And, if schools are only open four days, they might not be able to cover as much material. That could be awful for students who need extra help or who are trying to get into a good college.

Another con is that it could be really hard for people to adjust to having an extra day off. Like, imagine if you were used to working five days a week and then suddenly you only had to work four. It would be like, ""What do I do with myself?"" And, it might be hard for people to balance their work and personal life if they have an extra day off.

In conclusion, while a 4-day, 10 hour work/school week might have some cool benefits, like more time off and less impact on the environment, there are also some pretty big cons to consider. So, I think businesses",1,381
" Failure is often viewed as a hindrance to success, with some individuals believing that it can cause people to lose enthusiasm and give up. However, others argue that failure is an essential part of the pursuit of success, as it helps individuals to grow and become smarter.

Those who believe that failure doesn't play a role in the pursuit of success argue that people who are weak give up easily when faced with adversity. For example, have you ever been in a situation where you thought you would succeed, but instead received bad news? This can be disheartening and lead to a loss of enthusiasm.

On the other hand, those who believe that failure is an important part of the pursuit of success argue that professional individuals face hard times, sad days, and suffer before achieving success. They understand that setbacks are a natural part of the journey to success, and that it's important to learn from these experiences and not give up.

Additionally, those who believe that failure is an important part of the pursuit of success argue that smarter people learn from their mistakes and try not to give up. For example, if you lose an opportunity, it doesn't matter how many times you try, the important thing is to not give up.

In conclusion, while some believe that failure is a hindrance to success, others argue that it's an essential part of the pursuit of success. It helps individuals to grow and become smarter, and encourages them to not give up in the face of adversity. We should encourage individuals to embrace failure as a learning opportunity and use it to achieve success in life.",1,382

"Safety is first, that is one thing that everyone want especially in cars. Many people don't get that the idea of industries or companies making these smart cars is to help the environment by reducing the fuel use. Reducing fuel makes the environment more clean.

I am with the making of smart cars because the safety the car is going to have, saves money, and the smart car can save the environment.

Car safety is one of the most impart ante things. When a person buys a car safety is one of the things that people want more. The smart car has advanced technology that can indicate that a problem is going to happen. Sensors are being involved with this smart cars, sensors can help do something that you can not do because you are doing something else. Sensors can help you to decrees the chances that someone has.

And last smart cars would have a computer that has all the rules of driving that would allow it not to speed or do a wrong turn and even more.

Many people have jobs far away from their homes. People want cars that can waste less oil for more miles. Smart cars reduce held of what a normal car does. If fuel is wasted less than many products will reduce their price and many people would have to waste less money. People would save money and would have smart cars inside of normal cars. The economy would grow and people would be less poor than they are.

The environment is getting to bad from the worlds global warming that is increasing thanks to all the pollution humans do. Smart cars have the capability to use oil. There would be less oil wells in the whole world. Oceans would be less contaminated then they are know., ocean animals would die less. Many small towns or places would have less water problems then they do know.

Smart cars would do a big change in the world thanks to the oil reduce of the cars. The world would have a better way of life. I agree with smart cars because these cars would make a difference for everybody and for the world.",0,384
"Making decisions in life is an inevitable part of our existence. Whether it is choosing a career path, selecting a college, or deciding on a relationship, we must rely on our instincts and ideas to guide us through the process. In this essay, I will explore the importance of following one's instincts and ideas when making decisions in life. I will also discuss the consequences of making decisions without following instincts and why self-reliance is a crucial life skill.

Firstly, following our instincts and ideas is crucial because it allows us to make decisions that align with our values and beliefs. We have a unique perspective on life that only we can provide. When we trust our instincts and ideas, we are more likely to make decisions that reflect our true selves. For example, if you are passionate about a particular career path, following your instincts and ideas will help you pursue it with more conviction and dedication.

Secondly, making decisions without following instincts can lead to negative consequences. When we rely solely on external factors such as the opinions of others or societal norms, we may not be making decisions that align with our true selves. This can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and regret in the long run. For example, if you choose a career path based solely on the opinions of others, you may end up feeling unfulfilled and unhappy in your job.

Thirdly, self-reliance is a crucial life skill. When we rely on our instincts and ideas, we are more likely to make decisions that are based on our own knowledge and experience. This can help us develop a sense of self-confidence and independence. For example, if you are faced with a difficult decision, relying on your instincts and ideas can help you make a confident and informed decision.

Finally, real-life examples of when instincts have led to successful outcomes demonstrate the importance of following our instincts and ideas. For example, many successful entrepreneurs have relied on their instincts and ideas to create successful businesses. They may have faced criticism and opposition, but they trusted their instincts and continued to pursue their ideas. This has led to the creation of many successful companies and products.

In conclusion, following one's instincts and ideas is crucial when making decisions in life. It allows us to make decisions that align with our values and beliefs, develop self-re",1,385
"I wholeheartedly agree with the best way to travel being in a group led by a tour guide. There are so many benefits to travelling with a tour guide. First and foremost, a tour guide is an expert on the destination you are visiting. They will be able to give you insider tips and advice on what to see and do, which will make your trip more enjoyable. They will also be able to provide you with transportation, meals, and accommodation, which can save you a lot of money. Finally, a tour guide is a great source of entertainment. They will be able to tell you stories about the places you are visiting, which will make the journey more interesting.

"People in America vote for a candidate running for president believing that their vote counts, but in reality it all comes down to the Electoral College. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" We, as a country, need to change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States in order to have fair completion instead of the people of America voting for a potential president only to find out the vote was worth nothing.

To begin with, the majority of the nation wants to abolish the Electoral Congress because it's an unfair process. Bradford plume states, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It should be that the voters vote for the president, but we are just voting for electors, so they can vote for the president putting our nation's future in danger. The Electoral College used to be the right way of election, but now it's known as something from the past. Traditionally, the Electoral College was ""a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens, paragraph 1, by the Office of the Federal Register"" in which the founding fathers established this process of election knowing that then it was the correct way. But now, this process is ""outdated paragraph 14, Bradford Plume"" and there needs to be election by popular vote.

Another key point, former presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, agree with ""abolishing the electoral college paragraph 9, Bradford Plume"" as do Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL CIO, and the Gallup poll in 2000. Majority wants to get rid of the Electoral College in order to lets the popular vote decide who become president. Also, voters can't always control who their electors vote for. Bradford Plume notes, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" The Al Gore election is an example of the unfairness that the Electoral College is pursuing. Al Gore won the popular vote against George W. Bush nationwide, which means the people wanted Gore, but he did not receive enough electoral votes to win the election.

In the Electoral College's defense, the Electoral College, as illustrated by Richard A. Poster, ""restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution,"" meaning that a presidential candidate will give more attention to a larger state than a smaller state. Without the Electoral College, the president wouldn't have ""transregional appeal paragraph 19, Richard A. Poster,"" meaning that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, so the Electoral College requires the ""transregional appeal."" To conclude, our nation needs to change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States instead of election by the Electoral College because this process of election is unfair to the voters of this nation. Also, majority wins and the majority of the country wants to repeal the Electoral College then we should make a change. If we want this nation to be the strongest it can be then we need to make choices that will positively affect our country and the people of our country.",0,387
"France, Germany, United States, Colombia and other countries are taking actions of the problems that the cars are making. It is true that cars are helpful and make the life easier to some persons but lately the cancer of how this machines affect the ecosystem have being increasing. That is why countries have come with different projects to try to limit the amount of cars they are around their cities. If we see from a different perpestictive the limiting of cars can be a good thing and produce result that are favorable to everyone.

Through the years they have been several projects of reduction of car circulation, and it is visible that the population have adapted to the type of living that cities have imposed.

One example of this is Vauban, Germany were 70 percent of the families do not have a car and 57 percent sold a car to move there. With that example we can see that people can get used to a live where cars are not necessary to have. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I am such happier this way,"" these are the word of one of the resident of that city that get used to a lifestyle without a car. In that city people get used to walk which is more health and do not produce any harm to the ecosystem.

Other cities like Paris have made laws to control the amount of pollution cars produce since, this capital have more smog than other European capitals making this an awful fact. With the actions they have made of banking even-numbered license plate on Mondays they have reduced the amount of smog which is good. Another example is what is happening in Bogotá, Colombia where you can see car-free days, where people any other mean of transportations except for personal cars. When the actions of both cities are taken it is visible the change on the environment. This great ideas help the crowded cities to reduce their levels of pollution and incentive people on use the car less.

United States that is a country that produces a lot of pollution have seen good changes in the tendency of the people of using car. Studies have proved that the amount of new cars booed have decrease in the last years. Also, there have been a drop of the amount of people getting a license. This show that is a county support public transportation and make programs that will make people use less the cars they will have a positive result.

Walking and using a bike is good for the personal health. The less using of the cars help the fight against pollution and avoid the rise of temperature in the earth. Obesity and pollution are a big problem in the last decades but they both share something in common, they can be fought by using less a car and walking, being this the perfect statement that prove why limiting the car usage will be an advantage.",0,388
"Have you ever felt the need to communicate with a computer

Personally I think it is valuable to have ""The Facial Action Coding System,""in our computers in classrooms.

Although many may disagree, but we all have our own opinions. The reason being for my opinion is that if a computer in a classroom can tell if I'm sad it'll probably change my mood by the time I leave that class. Like the passage said if the computers in the classroom can tell if your sad it'll give u a different ad from the one you'll get if your happy or smiling. Also, let's say a student is sitting at the computer bored maybe the ad that pops up may change that for them. Many students nowadays don't do their work or what their supposed to-do because of boredom. I think having computers understand a persons emotions, mood, facial expressions etc. is pretty cool. You don't know what goes on out of school, to cause that persons emotions. If a person and computer can communicate I feel like till help out in so many ways. Especially, for the shy ones or the ones who are always upset. People like that don't want to talk to anyone or explained how they feel and holding everything in just effects, both physically and mentally. ",0,389
"Cars can be great or bad, many places are banning days of driving to slow down the inevitable of car fumes in the environment. Advantages include a healthier way of life. Walking makes you healthier, and so will the cleaner air. Creating less solution in areas in good for the environment.

The ban on cars can seem a little crazy. But picture how much healthier people would be if they didn't relief on their car to get somewhere. Now, even though there are large cities that are spread out, like Jacksonville, it seems almost insane to give up cars. People would be more forced to leave their house to go to work, school, etc.  But just picture how great it would be to save the environment and also getting a good healthy workout to and from where ever, it doesn't always have to be walking, bikes are what people use as well.

Global warming is real, and it is slowly happening. And cars are major factors for the cause. Some cities are taking action to this by banning driving in some way shape or form. This actually helps bring down smog. Paris saw the difference in only a few days!

Less solution is happening because of the new bans of cars in some places. And people are loving it! A healthier lifestyle is now being used. Less solution healthier for you and for Earth. It won't let me leave this page, I'm confused.",0,390
"I have two different opinions on cell phones during school. To preface them, I want to begin with saying that cell phone usage, as a whole, is of little importance. Teachers seem to be reluctant to enforce the current policies we have, as cell phones do not distract most students, especially if set to vibrate and not ring. And most students have enough control to not use them during a time of importance, like when taking a test. And no student will ever give up their usage of cell phones during class, so long there is a way to use them during class, even if it's against rules.

Both policies have their merit, but I believe Policy 1 would provoke less outrage from students. Not all students have free time at the same time as others. For example, when I'm in my lunch period, which is period 5, somebody else may be in their math class. This matters because I can possibly interrupt his thought during an assignment. Also, students will not turn their phones off unless punishment is severe, and teachers are actively looking out for students using cell phones. Policy 2 would also be fine, with the exception that students will probably be annoyed with the principal, or the Board of Education, or whoever promotes and declares this new policy. To work, Policy 2 would also have to be enforced well. However, students would likely resent Policy 2 more. It's restricting, especially when it pops into place so suddenly. Sudden, harsh change isn't favored by anybody. Even parents may be involved with making Policy 2 controversial within the town, as some feel the need to keep in touch with their child during school, especially after certain security issues happening at them, such as pipe bombs, smoke bombs, and guns being brought and used at some schools throughout the country.

Policy 1 is the better policy, but in the greater picture, a problem posed by something so miniscule as a cell phone doesn't matter. Thus, I'm indifferent to anything regarding cell phones. I do admit to using mine sometimes during class, but I have enough self-control to not turn it into a problem. However, if one is to go about changing the policy on cell phones, it'd have to be enforced well to work. This is where the boundaries of teaching and babysitting students blend. If cell phones are that much of a problem to the staff, then teachers likely aren't teaching because they're being told by their superiors to make cell phones a priority. When a teacher is actively looking for people that are using their cell phones during class, chewing gum, not wearing a school ID, etc., they ultimately aren't doing their job, and that is what truly matters.",0,391
"Dear principal,

I don't think that it is a good idea to change the grade average to a B. A C is a passing grade, and trying to keep up a grade B while playing sports could sometimes be really hard. Kids have a lot to do and maybe going through some rough times, and are already trying there best to keep up with a grade c. To get you thinking about why you should not change the grade average to B, I will give you some reasons of my own.

First I would like to start off by saying that it is really hard to keep up with your grades, and school and other important things students may have to do outside of school. Maybe they have a job, friends, family, personal things they are dealing with or have to do, and making that change will push them over the edge and stop them from playing. Also, a C is a passing grade, so the students are passing their classes and keeping up with school and everything else while playing a sport they love, so there isn't really any need to change the grade average. It is just unfair to the students. It is just too much for the kids to handle. It will hurt them not help them.

My second reason is that the best part about school besides friends is sports. To some kids sports is the best and most important part to them. They represent the school by playing to win and have fun. The school is fine the way it is so why make a change. Change is not always a good thing, it will just make everything harder and worse. You're raising the grade just keeps the kids from doing what they love to do. They can't keep up with everything all at once.

Lastly is that, what's the point? Everything is fine just the way it i. why change it? The students are keeping up their grade, and when their grade is getting lower (to a low c) the coach talks to them, saying that they better be careful. It scares the students to be getting a c because that's the boundary line. They shoot for getting an A or B anyway so it won't make a difference. It is just going to scare the kids. Also, by changing the grade average it is most likely going to bring down the team numbers. Not as many kids are going to try out because of that. Changing even just a little thing makes a big difference, and changing this will make even a bigger difference.

In conclusion, there is no need to change the grade average to a B. There is no point to it. The team and kids are doing fine just the way it is and changing the grade average will make a big difference, and not in a good way. Kids will stop trying out because there is just too much going on, and they can't keep up. Plus a C is a passing grade and students want to get a higher grade then that because it's risky at a C itself. Some kids are already struggling and raising the grade will just make it harder. Leave the average the way it is because I could guarantee you that it will not be a good idea. You don't know what kids have to do after school, or go through, and if the students and teachers and coaches are happy then what is the harm?",0,392
"In the article the author talks about driveless cars I believe this is a great idea. I believe with this there will be less car crashes and make the road a safer place all together. I have many rezones why. Including backup from the article.

I believe the car would be able to drive better than some people. In 2009 a Google car was driven more than half a million miles without a crash. The car will have a sensor the sensor has become advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. They also can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wetland reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. To make things more safe you are to be alert at all times its like going for a drive and relaxing, but you know if you ever feel unsafe you can take over.

The cars are developing so fast not only google is making one as other car companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are putting in effort to make one by 2020. Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passages, and pedestrians safe, and law enforcement know that the best way to get that is with an alert driver. The law questions how they are going to get around the car such as if an accident happens. Who is reliable the driver or the manufacture? Even if traffic laws change new laws will need to be made in order to work with the cars. I believe if the car will make everyone more safe than it is worth it.

In the new cars drivers need to be aware as if anything goes wrong with the drive they are there to take over. Why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? Wouldst it gets boring waiting for your turn to drive? I don't think so if it makes the roads safer than noting should be too much of a hassle.

In the article 'the psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" says Dr. Werner Huber. So the BMV is trying to make it more fun. The maurfatuers are trying to do it by bringing in car entertainment maybe TV. To keep things safe the entertainment would turn off as soon as the driver needs to take over.

In conclusion I believe cars that drive themself will be more safe and effective on the road. As people can use their time for other things while in a car. Driveless cars will be smart and less of a hassle then cars today. They will use less fuel and make people happier.",0,393
"I think that we students should at least keep a c grade average on the report card. So that we can attend our sports more easily and more relaxing. Too much work for someone may over work there brain, and that is called stressed. Stress can bring there grades down lower than ever.

It puts loads of pain suffering and difficulties for them. All together they will be crashing down, and it will be hard for them to come back for while. Parents will be shocked and heart broken to.

So keeping the grade averages should stay a c. For at least ports. This would be a problem if any student was falling because of stress and nobody wants to fail because of that. Would you? Cause to me that is horrible seeing someone fail. It's like watching your country get bombed. Its sad you don't want to watch people fail cause of a sport or grades. You want to help. You think about it and tell me what you think.",0,394
"Introduction:

Venus is a planet that has always intrigued us. It is similar in size and mass to Earth, but its atmosphere is very different. The surface of Venus is also hidden from view, making it a mystery that scientists have long wanted to unravel. But exploring Venus is not easy. The atmosphere is hostile, and the surface temperature can reach up to 462 degrees Celsius. Despite these dangers, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea.

Body:

The author provides several reasons why studying Venus is important. Firstly, Venus is the closest planet to Earth that can support life. The author states that ""Venus is the only planet in our solar system that comes close to Earth in terms of size and mass."" This means that studying Venus can help us understand how life on Earth evolved and whether it is possible for life to exist on other planets.

Secondly, the author argues that studying Venus can help us understand the effects of climate change. The author states that ""Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect that has made its surface a scorching escape."" By studying the atmosphere and surface of Venus, scientists can gain insights into how Earth's climate might change in the future. This is important because it can help us prepare for the consequences of climate change and find ways to mitigate its effects.

Thirdly, the author suggests that studying Venus can help us develop new technologies. The author states that ""the challenges of exploring Venus have led to the development of new technologies, such as advanced materials and propulsion systems."" By pushing the boundaries of what is possible in space exploration, scientists can develop new technologies that can benefit society in many ways.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" provides strong evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author highlights the importance of understanding how life on Earth evolved, the effects of climate change, and the development of new technologies. These reasons make it clear that the challenges of exploring Venus are worth the risks. I agree with the author that studying Venus is a valuable pursuit and hope that scientists will continue to explore this fascinating planet.",1,395
"Sports, yearbook, and clubs are all after school activities. They all help you get involved in your community and school. Being a part of an after school activities is awesome because you can meet new friend and have fun. Some people don't like getting involved in after school activities, but what if you had to be involved in at least one because the principal makes you; So would you agree of disagree with this rule. I would agree with this rule because getting students involved in an after school activity is a good thing it can teach them leadership, and they can also make new friends. they are also active by being a part of an after school activity keeps them off the couch.

When part of an after school activity students can develop leadership and new skills. By being part of a school sports team students can learn leadership, and they can stay active. If you are the best player on you chess club team then you can help the other people in the club and help them get better.

When you are a leader on the football field like a quarter back you need to be paying attention at all times. The can also help in the classroom because you could also learn how to pay attention in class more. No mater the activity you are a part of you can allow to learn something new and learn how to be a leader.

Being part of an after school activity can help you become more active and even loose a couple of pounds. If you are on a school sports team you can stay active. Even if you are only going to a ports team conditioning most of the time every school sports team does something to stay active and stay in shape, and even after the season is over you can still stay active and exercise on you own, so you can be ready for next season. Being on a school team you can do and learn so much from your coaches, and you can even learn a few things on your own.

When you are part of an after school activity you can meet new people. If you can't make any friends at school then you could join in an after school activity and make a hole lot of friends. If you never try and make friends you will just be only all the time and have no one to hang out with and goof around with, But if you do get involved in an after school activity you can make friend s and maybe even if lasting friendships with people that went to the same school as you, you would just never talk to anyone. So being a part of a school activity could change your life.

So that is the reason why I agree with making everyone be a part of at least on e after school activity they can accomplish so much. I just think that not being part of an after school activity what would you do. Joining an after school activity won't heart anything it will only help you it will help you learn leadership and new skills. It can also help you find new friends that you might end up hanging out with all the time.  ",0,396
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that attending a regular school is much more beneficial than attending classes from home through online or video conferencing. While some students may prefer online classes due to convenience and flexibility, I argue that the social and academic benefits of attending a regular school outweigh these advantages.

One of the most significant advantages of attending a regular school is the opportunity to interact with other students face-to-face. This interaction allows for the development of social skills and the building of meaningful relationships with peers. In online classes, students may miss out on these opportunities and struggle to develop social skills that are essential for success in the future.

Additionally, attending a regular school provides students with a structured environment that can help them stay organized and motivated. In online classes, students may struggle with procrastination and lack of accountability, which can negatively impact their academic performance. A regular school setting provides a consistent schedule and routine that can help students stay on track and achieve their academic goals.

Furthermore, attending a regular school provides students with access to resources and support that may not be available through online or video conferencing. For example, students may have access to tutoring services, counseling, and extracurricular activities that can help them succeed academically and personally. These resources can be invaluable in helping students overcome challenges and achieve their full potential.

However, I understand that some students may prefer online classes due to convenience and flexibility. For example, students who have busy schedules or live far from a school may find online classes to be a more convenient option. Additionally, some students may prefer the flexibility of online classes, allowing them to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.

In conclusion, while online classes may have some advantages, attending a regular school provides students with numerous benefits that are essential for their academic and personal success. The opportunity to interact with other students face-to-face, a structured environment, access to resources and support, and the development of social skills are all advantages of attending a regular school that cannot be replicated through online or video conferencing. While some students may prefer online classes, I believe that attending a regular school is ultimately the best option for most students.",1,397

"To allow cell phones in school is like letting kids play games and school is not fun and games. One reason why cell phones should not be aloud in school is other schools might not allow cell phones so who are we going text or call and why would we just text a person that is only down the hall that we will be talking to in a few minutes at lunch. Another reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is the halls and the lunchroom would be really loud from all the ringtones. That would be really annoying to the students in class. We come to school to learn and having cell phones around us is just distracting. Next thing you'll know students will start bringing iPods, portable gaming systems, and more. So, bringing cell phones to school doesn't help our education. It just distracts us because during class all you can think about is getting out of class to text your friend.

"I agree with the principal's decision that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. There are several benefits to being involved outside the classroom.

Participating in extracurricular activities has been shown to improve academic performance. When students are engaged in activities they enjoy, they are more motivated to succeed in their other classes. Being on a sports team or club requires time management and organization which carries over to studying and homework. It can also expose students to new topics and skills they may not learn in a traditional classroom setting.

Extracurricular activities also support social and emotional growth. They provide opportunities to make new friends with similar interests. Whether playing on a team or working together on a project, cooperative activities foster relationship building and communication skills. Being part of a group outside of classes can boost confidence and help students learn how to better handle responsibility, leadership, and setbacks. 

Requiring one activity allows all students to experience these benefits, not just those who are self-motivated to get involved independently. It prevents over commitment but ensures engagement with the school community. Most activities only require a few hours a week which is a small commitment for large rewards. Participating may also help reveal new talents, interests or career paths students don't know they have.

In conclusion, mandating one extracurricular activity is a reasonable decision that will benefit students academically, socially and personally. It cultivates well-rounded individuals and school spirit through balanced involvement beyond the classroom. I agree all students should take advantage of the opportunity to get involved through an activity of their choice.",1,400
"Dear Principle,

As you stated in the first written policy, I think students should be allowed to use their cellular phones during social times like Lunch. I think that is a reasonable policy.

As long as the phones are shut off during learning times it should be permitted.

In school students can only communicate with those that are around them, but it is fair to say that not all students find the company of their classmates enough to entertain them. Therefore, students should be allowed to use cell phones which allow them to connect with other people they know and may share more things in common with.

It's nice to be able t have options for whom you want to associate with during your free time. And cell phones widen the options of people you can communicate with.

It's not just a beneficial thing for students, but also to the parents of those children and family members. To be able to call your child during school to inform or remind them about something that may be personal is far better than having to call a school phone to speak to your child. There are pros and cons for having an available time set for people to use their phones. Things such as students not communicating with the people around them as much because they're too absorbed into their technology. It's a common case for young people today to get caught up into their phones and the internet etc, but it's their decision on how they should spend their time, and we should grant them the opportunity to choose how they spend their social time. It feels good to have options.

As long as students are still able to learn and keep focused at the times needed in class, then cell phone usage should be fine. It'll just be a well deserved privilege for their hard work throughout the course of the year. But I do hope to see this policy take place.

Please take my word into consideration, it's all that I ask. Thank you very much!

Sincerely,

(Your Student) ",0,401
"Hey, so I'm gonna talk about how people's first impressions of someone can change over time. Like, it's totally common for us to form an opinion of someone right away, but sometimes that opinion can change as we get to know them better.

One reason why this happens is because we tend to judge people based on superficial things like how they look or what they're wearing. Like, if someone shows up to school in a crazy outfit, we might think they're weird or try to avoid them. But then we find out they're actually really cool and funny, and our first impression totally changes.

Another factor that can influence a change in first impression is learning more about someone's personality and interests. Like, if someone seems really shy and reserved at first, but then we find out they're actually really into music or art, that can totally change our view of them. We might start to see them in a different light and become friends with them.

But sometimes, our first impression of someone can change because of something that happens after we've already formed that impression. Like, if someone does something really nice for us, like helps us with our homework or stands up for us in front of our friends, that can totally change our view of them. We might go from thinking they're not very nice to thinking they're actually really cool.

So, having a better understanding of someone can totally lead to a different view than that which is initially formed. It's like, we might form an opinion of someone based on one thing, but then we learn more about them and realize that they're actually way more interesting and cool than we thought. And that's pretty awesome.

In conclusion, first impressions can totally change over time as we get to know someone better. It's important to not judge people based on superficial things and to give them a chance to show us who they really are. Because, who knows, they might end up being way cooler than we thought.",1,402
"As a citizen of the United States, I have the right to have my opinion on the Electoral College, and my opinion is that we should not have an Electoral College because of many reasons. The reasons include the following if American citizens vote for a slate of electors that then vote for the president, we technically aren't even voting ourselves. Also, the electors that we vote for to elect our president don't always have to vote for the president we want, but it could also be in a case as if who they wanted to vote for. Lastly, the population of states affects the amount of votes cast off into the possible president's election.

In the Electoral College process, we, the U.S. citizens, vote for a group of electors who then vote for the President of the United States. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Westland Defenses of the System are Wrong, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president Paragraph 10."" Based on what the information that the paragraph is giving us, the citizens of the U.S. technically are not even having a say in whom the president is, America uses the quote ""It's a free country"", but really, you're not even letting the people have a say in whom the next president is...

Based on what I stated in the second paragraph, whoever we vote to be our electors of the voting for the U.S. president, don't always have to vote for whom the citizens want as president, but what they, the members of the congress want. ""Who are the electors? They can be any anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Paragraph 10."" It doesn't matter who is voting, what does matter is that they all have different opinions on who would do better if president. These electors chosen to vote are basically allowed to vote on whomever they agree is right, your vote is invalid to their opinion, it' who they want. And is that fair? No.

Another reason I do not think the electoral college is right is because the population of states affects the amount of votes cast off into the possible president's election. For example, according to paragraph 12 of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Westland Defenses of the System are Wrong, it says ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" What this is trying to say, is that it doesn't even matter about how many voters there are, but about how man representatives there are. This leads me back to my point of where we really have no say in who is president or not.

In the electoral college, In the Electoral College process, we, the U.S. citizens, vote for a group of electors who then vote for the President of the United States, but that doesn't always mean we get what we want when it comes to voting. Many reasons are listed about why the electoral college is not a helpful or meaningful process.",0,403
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that Venus is worthy of being studied despite the dangers that it presents. Us humans have landed on the Moon and sent and landed rovers on Mars why not try and land a rover on Venus. The author does a good job of supporting his/her claim that we should go to and study Venus more, by talking about how it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, sending blimp-like vehicles to hover above the surface, and testing that NASA has done.

Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the article the author states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" the author says in paragraph 4 is ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" the authors means that since Venus has all of these terrains that are similar to Earth that it may have had liquid water on the surface and the right temperatures to support life.

In the next paragraphs the author talks about imagining sending a blimp-like vehicle to Venus to hover around 30 miles above the surface like how our jet planes fly at a higher altitude to avoid flying in storms. Towards the end of paragraph 5 it states that the ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This shows that if we use the right materials we could fly the blimp-like aircraft and study how the air pressure is and the exact degrees the atmosphere would be.

Lastly, the author explains on how the testing that NASA has done. In the text the author says ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus... some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested. Simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" this shows that the author is getting information from a reliable source (NASA). The author also dives deeper and talks about how another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and that they can resist physical conditions better than modern computers.

In conclusion, the author did a great job saying that Venus is worthy of studying even though the dangers that it presents to us.

He/her supported their idea well with reasons like, how Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system saying that earlier in Venus's lifetime that it was probably covered in water and supported various lifeforms. Another reason was to imagine sending a blimp-like spacecraft to hover 30 miles above the surface o Venus, and, Lastly the test that NASA has been doing to spacecrafts to withstand Venus's surface for at least three weeks. These is good reasons to back up the claim that the author has made.",0,404
"In today's world there are many new ideas and thoughts people come up with to try and help the world be a better place. Most of these ideas don't get very far but one that really could make a différance has caused whole countries to take action. The whole idea of having or not having cars can be very controversial. It gives people the idea of following this idea and trying it out.

Multiple countries have already tested this care-free question, and it has come to be beneficial and very interesting for the cities. Of course there are the ups and downs to this idea but overall it has caused more and more cities to go out and try it. Banning the use of cars has helped not only people being lazy but also the environment. Cars produce strong chemicals that infect the air and create harm to the environment. Europe is one of the most polluted cities than anywhere else in the world. A main part of this pollution comes from the chemicals that comes out of cars. When people in Paris stopped using their cars; the air cleared. This just goes to prove that cars are awful for the environment.

The world has seen a great decrease in the number of drivers in the past decade. This means that with fewer drivers, fewer cars being driven. Especially in the United States the amount of drivers has decreased in numbers. People are coming up with new ways to get around that are a lot more efficient. Michael Siva who is a professor at the University of Michigan has found that the number of drivers between the ages of 16 and 39 have dropped largely.

Another positive outcome if this idea is the saving of time and money being spent on roads and other things that are used for driving. Of course walking or riding your bike to work may not sound very easy and in the long run, it is. Of course, you may have to change your daily routine, but it will help a bigger cause.

In conclusion; the world needs a change and the answer is sitting in front of our faces. In order to make this world a better place we need to stop the excessive use of vehicles and start using more efficient ways of transportation. There will always be those that disagree, but we should be more focused on a safer world than a few angry people.  ",0,405
"Standardized testing has been a topic of debate for many years in the education system. Some people believe that these tests are an accurate measure of student ability, while others disagree. In my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability because they do not take into account individual differences and learning styles.

One reason why standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not consider individual differences. Every student has a unique way of learning and processing information, and standardized tests do not take this into account. For example, some students may be better at visual learning, while others may excel in hands-on activities. Standardized tests only assess one type of learning, which may not be the best way for all students to demonstrate their knowledge.

Another reason why standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not allow for creativity and critical thinking. These tests often require students to memorize information and regurgitate it on the test. However, this does not accurately reflect a student's ability to think critically or creatively. For example, a student may be able to memorize the formula for finding the area of a circle, but they may not be able to apply this knowledge to a real-life situation.

Finally, standardized tests do not take into account external factors that may affect a student's performance. For example, a student may have a difficult home life or may be dealing with a personal issue that affects their ability to perform well on the test. Standardized tests do not consider these factors and may unfairly penalize a student for circumstances beyond their control.

In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability because they do not take into account individual differences, creativity, critical thinking, and external factors. Instead, teachers should use a variety of assessment methods that allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in different ways. This will provide a more accurate picture of a student's ability and will help them to succeed in school and in life.",1,406
"Dear Florida State senator,

I am in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the President of the United States. Changing the election by popular vote is more efficient than the electoral college process. Inputting this into the political voting system would enhance the voting process making it less difficult to deal with, get rid of the electoral college and its faults, and get the U.S. citizens opinion on whom the president should be and not just the electors voting for the president.

As you are already of aware of, the electoral college is the process where it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and the Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. By the explanation of what the electoral college is, you and I and many others can conclude that this process takes too much work;much more work than really does need to be put into place. Even though most Americans aren't aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they compromise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It's not fair and it's not right.

While reading an article about the electoral college(by Brad Plume), I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college; And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a ""Disaster Factor"" according to paragraph 11 in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter votes for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

In source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It's as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is band strictly off of the region in which on lives, because the majority of Republicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other people(No party, Democrats, etc.) that are inhabited in the regions of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, and that this person is not really their president.

The article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country's citizens. The electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.

"Dear Principal,

I should let us(kids) use our cell phones during because I think the student will be good. Another reason we should use our cell phones is during lunch is because we can text during lunch, so we don't have to wait after school to text our friends because during lunch we can text our friends and if we need 2 text our mom just in cast we forget our homework we can text mom to bring the homework for us before we can get an 0 % on homework.

We can use our cell phones to take picture of what our homework should be on, and we can send them to the kids that are not in school, so they can do homework in true there homework in without teacher telling them they got to do for homework. So let us use our cell phones for this reason, you should be kind to lets us use phones in school please! So what do you say about we use our phones. I think you would be the best principal. And that would help us in school. But we will keep our cell phones turned off during classes.",0,408
"The human face itself can determine someone's expressions within seconds upon looking on the person. You don't need no computer telling you whether if they feel happy or whatnot. It is a waste of time and money to buy the technology and put in time for basic things we should know as humans. The human face is easy to decode by your own self.

As in the article is says Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry by just a computer telling you these things but not off facts but off programs it was given to work. Its programmed to tell whether you are feeling this or that its set off a database of emotions all in one. The article even states they're all just calculations and not fully correct they're going off basic emotions.

Therefore I see as in it not being valuable to profit in. you don't need all this to decode a persons face. You don't need a man made program just a for a computer to tell you what you already know. People aren't just subjects to test on for emotions you have to know this in life. Take the hints, and gesture.",0,409
"Driverless cars are indeed a very complex subject. In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", The text states that the car he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus, Which would actually come to be very helpful in some ways. By using half the fuel of today's taxis the car would save a lot of money for he who has it. Transportation as in busses and taxis, would not get as much business, although it may seem like a good idea, A lot of the men and women who drive these public transportation devices would be losing their jobs if people decide to not use them any more because there is self sufficient cars, and they would comply to being forced to try to find another job which they might not be able to get.

The Driverless Cars are built very complex. They use a ton of sensors all around the car which most likely takes a lot of money to put into building, Money that is probably taken from taxes the government collects from the people, A lot of people would be losing money to build something that isn't 100% sure that it would even work. The article says that these self sufficient cars have been tested to drive millions of miles without crashing, and still would need some assistants to park and back up out of parking spots.

""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."", or so the article says in passage Eight. Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use head on displays. Which can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over, But by doing this the driver would be very distracted by the displays and if the driver needed to ""take over"", they would be too distracted to do so in a life-saving manner.

It is illegal to even test computer driven cars, not all states are willing to follow through with allowing it. It would take a long time to try and get all states on board with the situation. If the traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident, which will also take even more time to come up with those laws and get them passed. Even though the passages state that the Driverless Cars would in the long run be less money, It will be more money to construct the whole thing and make sure they all are trustworthy. So the question is, can we really trust ""Driverless Cars""? ",0,410
"No Cell Phone Use While Driving

While driving down the road in her car, JIRA's cell phone rings, but she tries to not pay attention to the phone. Later, her phone lights up for a text message. She thinks that this could be important, so she checks the message. CRASH! Next thing she knows, she is waking up in a hospital, with her family and friends trying to tell her she was in a car accident. She tells her family and friends what happened for her to crash. She was texting and driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"" (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). Based on this information, a lot of people have crashed their cars and been hurt or lost their lives to cell phone use while driving. Using cell phones while driving puts the driver and others at risk, and there should be no cell phone use (texting or talking) while driving because it can cause wrecks and even death.

First, texting while driving is dangerous because it distracts the person driving which can cause an accident. When a person is using a cellphone while driving, the focus is on the text message and not on the road. Drivers need to be focused on just driving. Texting is very popular today, especially with people my age, and texting while driving has become really easy to do.

This affects my generation the most because, according to the article on ""Texting and Driving Accidents Statistics-Distracted Driving"", ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving""; teen brains, like mine, are trained to quickly pick up their phone when they hear a notification (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). When teens get text messages or calls from their partners or friends, they become more worried about that notification, and it seems that they sometimes forget they are driving. Cellphones can be like the devil.

The person is constantly tempted to use the cellphone at the wrong time and can become attached to it, which causes a lot of danger.

Talking on the cell phone while driving is also dangerous because it distracts the driver, too. Whether it is Bluetooth or holding the phone in your hand, this distraction causes car accidents which can cause death of the driver and others. According to the Teenage article, ""it takes only 3 seconds after a driver's attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). That being said, no matter how careful one thinks they are being, one moment of being distracted can change a person's life. When driving distracted by your cell phone, you can get into arguments with someone on the phone or can get horrible news that can cause you to lose focus on the road. This loss of focus can easily cause terrible injuries or even deaths. A lot of people have lost their lives because of their decision to talk or text on phones while driving.

To sum it all up, one should not drive and use their cell phone due to how dangerous it is. Driving distracted by a cell phone can cause car accidents with terrible injuries and even death.

Distracted driving is dangerous to everyone, especially teens. According to an article on distracted driving, ""driver distraction is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). Adults and teens put themselves and others at risk when they make the selfish decision to use their phones and drive. As studies continue to show, use of cellphones while driving isn't safe and causes harm and death to many people in our country. We can all do our part and put the cell phone away while driving. The life you save may be your own. Stay safe and make good choices. Do not lose your life over your cell phone.

"While the notion of aliens creating the ""Face on Mars"" is intriguing, upon close examination the scientific evidence clearly shows it is simply a natural landform shaped by geological processes over time. 

The irregular, non-symmetrical features of the Face provide the first clue that it was not deliberately designed or constructed. Its shape is inconsistent with what we would expect an artificial structure to look like. Notably, the two ""eyes"" are of unequal size and the ""mouth"" area is uneven. If aliens had created it, we would expect facial features to be more proportional and balanced. 

Additionally, images taken at different angles show the Face is an illusion created by shadows in a sloping mesa area. The NASA photos from the Viking orbiter missions revealed that when sunlight hit the mesa at different angles during the day, shadows fell in ways that emphasized some rock formations over others, making them look like facial features to human observers. But up close, the individual rocks and formations are irregular and do not smoothly connect to resemble an actual face. 

Furthermore, erosion patterns studied by geologists affirm that wind and water wear down rock surfaces over long periods, naturally forming rounded and smooth shapes similar to what we see in the Face over hundreds of thousands of years. The coarse layered rocks in that region of Mars, composed of materials like sandstone and shale, are particularly prone to eroding into characteristic mesa landforms. 

In conclusion, while the idea of aliens visiting Mars in the distant past remains intriguing speculation, thorough scientific analysis has conclusively shown that the so-called ""Face on Mars"" is simply a chance arrangement of geological features formed by natural weathering and erosion over immense time spans. Its irregular composition and formation through normal planetary geological processes prove it is definitely not an artificial construction or relic of an alien civilization. The most reasonable conclusion is that it is completely natural in origin.",1,412

"Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is important to understand its role in pursuing success. Failure is often seen as a negative thing, but it can actually be a valuable learning experience. When we fail, we are forced to examine our actions and make changes to improve in the future. This can lead to greater success in the long run.

Life can be a mean and nasty place, and criticism from others can be tough to handle. It is important to remember that not everyone will agree with us, and that is okay. We should take constructive criticism to heart and use it to improve ourselves. It is also important to surround ourselves with positive and supportive people who will encourage us to keep going.

Self-determination and self-worth are crucial in achieving success. We must believe in ourselves and our abilities, and have the drive to pursue our goals. It is important to remember that success is not just about external validation, but also about internal satisfaction. We must value our own worth and not let the opinions of others define us.

Starting a new job can be overwhelming, and we may not be completely confident. It is important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it is okay to ask for help. We should also take the time to learn and grow in our new role, and not be afraid to take risks. This can lead to greater success and a sense of accomplishment.

The relationship between failure and success is complex. Failure can lead to greater success, as it can teach us valuable lessons and help us grow. On the other hand, success can also lead to complacency and a lack of motivation to continue striving for greater things. It is important to remember that failure is not the end of the road, and that success is a journey, not a destination.

"Sure thing! Here's my attempt at writing an essay on the positive impact of technology on human life as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, you all! Today we're gonna talk about how technology has made our lives way easier. Like, think about it - we used to have to walk to the library to do research, but now we can just Google it and get the answers in like, two seconds. It's crazy!

First, technology has made communication so much easier. We can FaceTime our friends and family who live far away, and it's like they're right there with us. We can also send them messages and pictures through social media, which is way faster than sending a letter in the mail. And with video games, we can play with our friends online and hang out with them even if we're not in the same room. It's like, the best thing ever!

Another way technology has made our lives easier is by helping us learn stuff. There are so many cool websites and apps that can teach us anything we want to know, from math to history to how to play the guitar. And with online courses, we can even take classes from teachers all around the world! It's like, we're not limited to learning just what's in our textbooks anymore.

But I think the thing that really shows how technology has made our lives easier is how it's helped us with work. Like, my mom uses her computer to work from home, and she can do so much more than she could before. She can make presentations and spreadsheets and stuff, and it's way faster than doing it by hand. And with online shopping, we can buy things from anywhere in the world and have them delivered right to our doorstep. It's like, the convenience of technology is just insane!

So yeah, technology has definitely made our lives easier. It's like, it's changed everything. And I'm not saying it's all good, but it's mostly good. Like, sure, there are some downsides to technology, but overall, it's made our lives way better. So let's keep using it and see where it takes us! 😁",1,415
" Whether the author Ralph Waldo Emerson was right in what he wrote is a topic of debate. While it is important to remember what you have already learned, it is also crucial to keep pushing yourself to learn new things. It is not enough to simply repeat the same actions or ideas that you have already mastered. Instead, it is important to constantly strive for growth and progress.

Firstly, it is important to remember what you have already learned, but it is also important to continue to learn new things. It is not enough to simply repeat the same actions or ideas that you have already mastered. Instead, it is important to constantly strive for growth and progress. This means being open to new ideas and experiences, and being willing to take risks and try new things.

Secondly, it is important to remember that progress and growth are not just about repeating the same actions or ideas. It is important to constantly strive for new and innovative ways of thinking and doing things. This means being willing to challenge the status quo and to push yourself outside your comfort zone. It also means being open to feedback and criticism, and using it to improve and grow.

In conclusion, it is important to remember what you have already learned, but it is also important to keep pushing yourself to learn new things. It is not enough to simply repeat the same actions or ideas that you have already mastered.

"Online Schools vs. Traditional Schools: Which is Better?

As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about the different types of schools and how they can impact a student's academic success. In recent years, online schools have become more popular, and it's important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes online as opposed to traditional schools. In this essay, I will investigate how online schools can benefit students of all ages, including adults, and how they can help those who did not finish their studies.

One of the main advantages of attending an online school is the flexibility it offers. Online schools allow students to learn at their own pace, which can be especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where traditional schools may not be available. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have different learning styles, as they can learn in a way that works best for them. For example, some students may prefer to learn visually, while others may prefer to learn through hands-on activities. Online schools can provide a more personalized learning experience, which can lead to better academic success.

Another advantage of online schools is the access to resources that they provide. Online schools often have a wide range of educational resources, such as video lectures, online textbooks, and interactive activities. These resources can help students learn more effectively and can provide additional support for students who need it. Additionally, online schools can provide access to resources that traditional schools may not have, such as online tutors or specialized courses.

However, there are also some disadvantages to attending online schools. One of the main disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. While online schools provide flexibility, they can also make it harder for students to connect with their teachers and classmates. This can lead to a sense of isolation and can make it harder for students to build relationships with their peers. Additionally, online schools may not provide the same level of social interaction as traditional schools, which can be important for students' social and emotional development.

Despite these disadvantages, online schools can still be beneficial for adults who may not have had the opportunity to finish their studies in the past. Online schools can provide a way for adults to",1,417

These beliefs of Jefferson's still resonate today, especially in the modern workplace. As technology continues to advance and more people are relying on collaborative talents, it is essential to remember the lessons that Jefferson taught us about the need to work hard and treat others with respect. People of all backgrounds need to come together to ensure that we are able to effectively and efficiently solve any issues that arise. Of course, mutual respect is key to this endeavor.

The sentiments that Jefferson promoted are as relevant now as they've ever been. We must never forget the importance of values such as hard work and respect for each other. His unwavering commitment to ensuring the longevity of these principles can continue to serve us ####and help us move towards a brighter and more productive future.",1,418
"Climate change is a real and pressing issue that affects everyone on Earth. It's crazy to me that some people still don't believe it's real, like come on, the ice caps are melting, what more proof do you need?! Anyway, I think governments definitely need to take immediate action to address this issue.

First, climate change is caused by human activity, and therefore it's our responsibility to fix it. We've been pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere for centuries, and it's had a devastating impact on the planet. It's caused rising temperatures, droughts, wildfires, and intense storms. It's not just affecting the environment, it's also affecting human lives. We've seen it in the news, people dying in heatwaves, losing their homes in natural disasters. It's heartbreaking and it's our fault. Governments need to take action to reduce our carbon footprint and transition to renewable energy sources.

Secondly, the longer we wait to take action, the worse it's going to get. Climate change is like a snowball rolling down a hill, it's gaining momentum and getting bigger and bigger. If we don't do something now, it's going to be almost impossible to stop it. We need to take drastic measures to reduce our emissions and invest in sustainable technology. Governments need to work together to make this happen.

Lastly, it's not just about saving the planet, it's also about saving ourselves. Climate change is a global issue that affects everyone, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality. It's a collective responsibility, and we need to work together to combat it. By taking action on climate change, we're not only saving the planet, we're also creating a better future for ourselves and future generations.

In conclusion, governments need to take immediate action to address climate change. It's our responsibility, it's getting worse every year, and it's a collective responsibility. We need to work together to reduce our carbon footprint and transition to renewable energy sources. Let's do this!

"Students have projects throughout the whole school year to expand their learning. All the projects are usually teacher-designed and students are given requirements of what needs to be in their project. A lot of schools have summer projects to keep students engaged in learning over their break. Since teachers design all the in-school projects, students should design their summer projects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it lets students be more creative, have more freedom, and prepare them for the future.

Students should design their summer projects because it lets them be more creative. Having students be more creative makes it more of a fun time to be learning. They will research things that interest them, and they will want to put in the work. They will actually get excited about some school work their doing. Summer is a time to have fun and rest. Having to do work assigned by teachers will make students lazy. If students design their projects, they can do research on things they've done during their break also. If something they've done, or somewhere they went is what they want to do for there project, then they should be able to be creative and do it. If students are allowed to be more creative, they will almost make it a competition and want to make it better than others. It will make them thing outside the box to come up with something no one else will do. Also, doing a different type of project makes it more challenging which makes them be more creative. If they do a project on something they enjoy, then they will become more creative.

Second, students should design their summer projects because they will have more freedom. Having more freedom motivates students to do their work. If they are more motivated to do it, it will come out better and students will feel better about the work they did. Like said about being creative, if students have more freedom, they will research on something they enjoy and have fun doing it. They will want to do the work which would end up with a better final product. Many students, especially in the summer, will put things off thinking they have all the time in the world, and then it ends up being two days before school starts, and they haven't started their project. If they don't have a list of things to do, they will feel like they have more work to do and create their own list of things and do their research, etc. When they know what they have to do, they will procrastinate. When they're kind of lost, they feel like they need to get it started.

Last, students should design their summer projects because they will become more prepared for the future. Students will have to work independently because everyone will be doing something different. They wouldn't be able to check in with other people or get the answers, they have to put all the work in themselves. Having no one guiding them prepares them for the future for when they will have to create your own projects all the time. It makes things more challenging and really makes them do all their research and perfect their projects. If they are being challenged, they will get better at doing their projects and make teacher-designed projects easier. They will become less dependent on their teacher and become more trusting in themselves because they can do things on their own. In the future, they won't always have someone to check with and guide them on what their supposed to-do.

While teacher-designed projects keeps students on track and makes it easier for them, students creating their own projects prepares them for their future jobs and college projects, and gives them more space to research things they enjoy and find more interesting which motivates them to do the work. If summer-projects are student designed, they will grow up to be more prepared, creative people.",0,420
"Driverless Cars Are Not Good!

Driverless cars mean a car that does not need a human to control of the car. Driverless cars are not safe because you can't tell if something bad can happen to it or not. If it's safe, why aren't there any in the public. Even the producers of the cars are not 100% sure of the condition. The car can't deal with big problems like; dealing with complicated traffic issues. It is better to use the now days cars than the driverless. It would cost a lot more than the cars that we use now.

The driverless cars are not trustworthy. What if you fell asleep while they car can't deal with the traffic issues? The cars are not use yet where the people like us can see it. What if the car doesn't hit the brake when you're about to crash? Some people are more comfortable when they drive.

It may be the double price of the cars that we're using right now. It is better to have Honda or Toyota than the driverless car because you have the control of the car. Furthermore, it is important to have control of the car because you might want to change your location when you're driving. You save more money. You can feel better if you have control. If you're on driverless car; I am sure that you would feel scared.

Some people feel more comfortable when they drive because they don't trust the driver. Technology is high but is it high enough to drive, but it's self? If you're really sleepy and the driverless car is in the situation of traffic issues; what you does? You might as well just crash. If you drive the normal cars it is safer and better. It is safer because you have control of it. If you're too sleepy, you can take a nap first.

Finally, driverless cars are cars that is not controllable. You don't know if It's safe or not. There are no benefits; it's just that it is better because it uses less fuel than the amount we're using right now. Drive normal cars are better because it cost less. If you have control of the car; you feel more confidence.",0,421
"To home it may concern,

From my knowledge based on the sources I've been given on the Electoral College, I strongly believe it should be abolished. To me, it seems senseless to be voting for a slate of electors rather than a president. Also, anyone not in office can be an elector so that means they may not be the best person to be representing your vote. The electors may only vote for whom they want rather than go with the vote of the people which is why I believe the president should be elected by popular vote. This would also mean there would never be a tie. In the event of a tie the House of Representatives would take the vote. So the representative of Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have the same power of as the representative of California, representing 35 million voters. It should be quite clear why popular vote would make more sense. We have outgrown the electoral college as a nation.

Thank you for your time,

"The presidential election is an enormous event that almost all Americans over the age of eighteen participate in. But there is one problem, the system we use for it is outdated, unfair, and just terrible! The electoral college needs to be removed because voters need more power, and there are tons of problems that come with the electoral college.

There are some pretty solid defenses for the United States to keep the electoral college. For example, as stated in the article by Poster, even though some candidates can dominate regions, ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" But the thing is, even though it might not be enough to win the election, it extremely benefits the candidates race. Another defense states in poster's article is that the trust of the slate of electors that you are actually voting for is ""rarely betrayed."" This is a flawed defense because it shouldn't be rarely betrayed, instead, it shouldn't be betrayed at all!

Since the trust of voters in the slate of electors can't be betrayed, why not put the power in the voters hands instead of people most of the voters have never even met? The voters aren't even voting for the president in the electoral college system, they are voting for a slate of electors. And in the text written by Plume, that the voters can't even control who they're voting for! Another claim in plumber's article to back the last sentence up is: ""The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" That is just ludicrous! Also, voters quite frequently ""get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates."" That just goes to show one of the extreme amount of problems that the electoral college system has. As stated in plumber's passage, one of the biggest problems the electoral college system has is that ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" But, no one can expect them to listen because, you can clearly tell from their system that they don't care about the common voters' opinion, but the direct election system does. In plumber's article, he loosely states that another thing that can go wrong with the system we have now is the state can possibly cheat and send two slates of electors to Congress. It has happened before, so who says it can't happen again? ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" John Plume Having a tie is just another terrible flaw in the awful electoral college system that the United States runs today.

Most voters can't even have a say in the election if we don't stop running the electoral college system. But, if the U.S. finally smartens up and changes, the presidential election would have much fewer problems, and it would put more power in the hands of the people like a democracy should be.",0,423
"I do not fully agree that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities. While there is certainly a need for more community-oriented activities, there is evidence to suggest that young people are actively engaging in activities that benefit their communities.

First and foremost, many young people are volunteering their time to organizations and causes in their communities. A recent study found that nearly one-third of all high school and college students aged 16-24 volunteered at least once in the past year, with nearly half of those volunteers contributing over 100 hours of their time. Additionally, many young people are taking part in community service projects, such as park cleanup days, food drives, and other charitable events.

Furthermore, young people are becoming more involved in local and national politics. Although the voting rate for this age group remains low, young people are becoming more active and engaged in civic affairs. Many university students are running for local and national office, while others are joining political advocacy groups or running their own political campaigns. They are also getting involved in local initiatives, such as ballot referendums and community engagement projects.

That being said, there is certainly room for improvement. Too many young people are not taking the time to get involved in their communities, whether it be through volunteering or political action. There is also a lack of meaningful engagement with their local representatives and elected officials.

In conclusion, while young people are doing more to help their communities than ever before, there is still much work to be done in order to fully engage this age group in the civic process. By getting involved in their local communities and taking part in meaningful activities that benefit others, they can make a real difference in their own communities and the world at large.

"The face on Mars is just a natural landform. There are no facts showing that it is not just a landform. If plans were to build this landform we would have been aware of it.

The Mars face is actually a mess which are common sight in the American West. So this is strong proof that it is actually just a natural landform. If there was something out there like plans which would have been proven to be real by now we would have proof of there existence then that could be another explanation but since we have no proof that they exist then we quickly ruled out that as an option

We knew as soon as the pictures where released that the critics and media would go crazy on NASA. Of course, we know that there's people that are going to think NASA is hiding information from the public but if there was life on Mars we would people to know that. When all the pictures came out they made a bunch of money. The face has actually become a pop icon. So if there was life on Mars we would want to share it with the public.

If the face wasn't a natural landform what is it then that's what I would like to know. Don't you think if it wasn't a landform we would want people to know we could make billions!

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement is motivated by a number of factors, including concerns about the environment, public health, and urban sprawl.

One of the main concerns about car usage is its impact on the environment. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. They also produce air pollution, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.

Another concern about car usage is its impact on public health. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can lead to increased stress levels, accidents, and air pollution. Car accidents are the leading cause of death for people aged 15 to 24 in the United States.

Finally, car usage has been linked to urban sprawl. As more people move to the suburbs, they rely on cars to get around. This leads to the development of low-density, car-dependent communities that are less sustainable than more compact, walkable communities.

There are a number of things that can be done to limit car usage. One option is to improve public transportation. This could involve making buses and trains more frequent and reliable, as well as expanding the reach of public transportation systems. Another option is to build more bike lanes and sidewalks, making it easier for people to get around without a car. Finally, cities can encourage car-sharing and ride-sharing programs, which can reduce the number of cars on the road.

Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and make cities more livable. It can also save people money on transportation costs. In addition, limiting car usage can promote physical activity and social interaction.

There are some challenges to limiting car usage. One challenge is that it requires a change in people's behavior. Many people are used to driving everywhere, and they may not be willing to give up their cars. Another challenge is that it requires investment in public transportation and other infrastructure. However, the benefits of limiting car usage outweigh the challenges.

In conclusion, there are a number of reasons why we should limit car usage. Car usage has a negative impact on the environment, public health, and urban sprawl. There are a number of things that can be done to limit car usage, such as improving public transportation, building more bike lanes and sidewalks, and encouraging car-sharing and ride-sharing programs. Limiting car usage has a number of benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and making cities more livable. We should all do our part to limit car usage and help create a more sustainable future.",1,426
"I beam, flashing a smile towards the camera of my mom's iPhone. In my hand, I grip a four-by-three inch square of plastic that, in my perspective, is synonymous with freedom. It's the moment every kid dreams about, lying belly-down on the kitchen floor and pushing a Barbie jeep around their mother's feet as she labors away at the stove, the stark scent of garlic filling their little noses. Finally, I got my driver's license! While definitely a defining moment of adolescence, most teenagers refuse to acknowledge the degrading qualities of driving. Limiting car usage has a multitude of benefits, such as decreasing air pollution and improving the health and quality of life of the world's people.

As a new driver, there is nothing I despise more than waking up to severe smog, squinting as I corral my vehicle down blurred roadways' en route to school. By utilizing my own vehicle, however, I am adding to the problem. Smog and other forms of unaesthetic air pollution are caused in part by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars' tailpipes. In the United States, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. (Source 1) Another large percentage of these emissions comes from the inefficient, energy-wasting, carbon-spewing processes required to create gasoline and diesel fuel. Essentially, we emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to produce fuel for our vehicles which, in turn, release more greenhouse gases. As an AP Environmental Science student, I know better than anyone the degrading results of excessive greenhouse gases. As these particles accumulate in the atmosphere, light from the sun, including harmful ultraviolet rays, stays trapped in our planet, causing a gradual rise in average temperature. This process is known as global warming. Besides being dangerous to our planet, air pollution is unappealing visual to all inhabitants of Earth. Smog once reached such high levels in Paris, the capital of France, that a partial driving ban was placed on the city to purify the air. After one day of diminishing the number of cars on the roads by 50%, the smog had cleared enough for civilians to continue their daily activities. (Source 2) The grotesque images associated with smog can harm Paris' economy; tourists want to view the Palace of Versailles with a tear in their eye from its beauty, not from the sting of air pollutants.

Limiting car usage also has a variety of physical and psychological benefits that improve the health of earth's people. For example, a suburban community in Germany, known as Vauban, has gone completely car-free. 57% of Vauban's residents sold a car to move in and, so far, the majority of them seem to be enjoying the benefits. Hadron Walker, a media trainer and mother of two, is one of them. ""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" she said, ""I'm much happier this way."" (Source 1) Walker's statement shows the improved psychological well-being of those who do not rely on cars for the majority of their transportation. Decreased reliance on motor vehicles can also improve the physical health of humanity. Without personalized vehicles for transportation, many people will walk, jog, bike, or skate to their various destinations. Such a phenomenon occurs annually in Bogotá, the capital of Columbia. Every year, they host a ""Day Without Cars"", during which Colombians rely on their own two feet to move about their sprawling city. (Source 3) Physical activities such as walking have a variety of benefits, including increased cardiovascular health. If more countries hosted events similar to Bogotá's ""Day Without Cars"", emergency rooms may find they have less clogged arteries to deal with.

Limiting car usage has many pros, including decreased air pollution and increased mental and physical well-being of the world's people. The next time you unlock your car to drive two minutes to your friend's house, stop and consider the consequences of your actions. Consider the health of yourself and your planet, and try walking instead.",0,427
" Before participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program, I had never left the country, driven a tractor, or even tended to a garden. Once I graduated from high school, I figured it was time to venture out into the world and try something new; I wanted ""to see the world"" before I had to get serious about my life. After some research, I discovered the Seagoing Cowboys program and immediately knew it was the right decision for me.  

Initially, I was unsure what to expect. I had never been on a boat before and get seasick easily. However, I was assured that we would stick to more protected bodies of water, so I didn't have anything to worry about. I'm glad I didn't allow my fear to hold me back because this experience has been incredible. Not many people can say they've been to Alaska and Hawaii, let alone delivered cattle to both places!

Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program has been one of the best decisions I've made. I've seen things I never thought I'd see, met people I never thought I'd meet, and experienced things I never thought I'd experience. I'm glad that I got the opportunity to take part in this unique program and encourage anyone else considering it to take the leap! You might be surprised at how much you grow from the experience. 

Of course, there are certain drawbacks. The work is difficult, and it can be scary at times, but it is certainly worth it. You'll make plenty of great memories and have loads of incredible stories to tell. If you're thinking about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, do it! You won't regret it. ",1,428
"There are a few reasons why people might think that famous people are treated unfairly by the media. Some people think that famous people are given more privacy than other people, and they should be given more of it. Others think that this is the price of their fame. Do you agree or disagree with either of these opinions?

There are a few specific reasons why people might think that famous people are treated unfairly by the media. For one, famous people often have more money and privileges than other people. They can often go to more places, and they often have more access to media and other resources. This can make it difficult for other people to know what is happening in their lives.

Another reason why famous people might be treated unfairly by the media is because they often make decisions that the media likes. Famous people often have a lot of control over their lives, and they can often make choices that the media likes. This can make it difficult for other people to know what is happening in their lives.

Finally, some people think that the media is often biased against famous people. This means that the media often reports negative things about famous people, even if the people in question are not doing anything wrong. This can make it difficult for other people to know what is happening in their lives.

All of these reasons make it difficult for people to know what is happening in the lives of famous people. It is possible that the media is not unfair to them, but it is also possible that they are being treated unfairly. It is up to each individual to decide which opinion they think is more accurate.

"At first, when you hear driverless car, you think what in the world. That sounds so cool, I want one. Let me just tell you, they may sound cool, but how safe is it really?

Driverless cars seem cool and easy, but do they really sound safe? These cars have a lot of sensors, but what if one of them breaks? In my opinion, yeah sure it would be nice, but I wouldn't trust them. Like it said in paragraph 9, drivers would get tired of waiting for the car to signal them to drive. Just because there are entertainment systems doesn't mean it will keep drivers focused. There would still be the pain of always waiting around for the car to signal you to take control.

This car would also raise many questions if you got into wreck. Who's fault is it were in a wreck? It could be the manufacturer of the car because something broke or didn't signal right. It could also be your fault for now paying attention. Not to mention, if these cars were allowed, lots of things would change. Traffic laws would change in order to deal with all the expenses and damage done in an accident. Who is going to pay for all of it?

"The author is trying to show us why we should try to shrive for having a human on Venus for the first time, but he did not do it correctly. The author does not support his idea on why we should keep researching Venus and take a human to Venus.

This shows how the author was saying reasons why we should not try to get a man on Venus.

The author may have had a little evidence for his side of the argument, but he used more of the other side which will make people think the other way than what the author really wants you to think.

"Facial Action Coding System is a new software that has given computers the ability to identify the emotion of a person. It does this by constructing a 3-D model of the face. This new innovative software can identify six emotions of a human. These emotions are happiness, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. This technology can be useful in many ways in today's world. There are also some things that may not be so good about this either.

This software has many positive things about it that can help students and teachers across the world. The software can help inside the classrooms. Using this software to calculate and identify people's emotions, it would be very easy to see if a student is struggling. Many students who struggle keep it to themselves hoping to catch on. This may not be the case in every student, though. Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If this software can actually detect this, then it would make learning and teaching way easier. Teachers could try different teaching methods to help with the growth and progress of their students and help them understand what they're doing. They could also try something that is more fun and appealing to the students. This technology could be lifesaving in the classroom.

Although this software could help many people everywhere, how does everyone feel about this? If used in the classrooms, some parents and students may not want this to be a part of their learning environment. Many students could be sad all the time due to person issues and home life. Would they want their teacher to know that they were always upset? I think that it would be a good idea to first have received permission from every student and parent before allowing this into the classrooms.

I also think that this software could literally save lives. If it is able to identify these emotions, it could prevent students from harming themselves. The software can determine your emotion based on every little detail of your face. In paragraph 8 the author states, ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis could pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygotic major and a different muscle, the rigorous."" With this being said, if you try to hide your emotions, the computer will still be able to tell. I think school counselors should have this technology in schools right now. Getting proper equipment to identify how a student is feeling could help the counselors talk to them about their problems because not all students will share how they feel.

With all the information that I provided, I definitely think that this technology is valuable. The software provides accurate results, and it could early help students and teachers every day in the classroom. What more could you ask for than a safe and reliable software that could raise test scores and possibly save some lives? This may just be the next big thing.  ",0,432

"Venus is an interesting planet for various reasons.

Scientists believe that Venus is alike to earth. It has about the same density and size compared to earth. In the article it states in paragraph 4 that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This quote helps state that it is an interesting planet and alike Earth they want to study and learn about it knowing the conditions.

Another example of how Venus is an interesting planet is because of the atmosphere and the ground conditions it has. Astronomers believe humans could survive there, however it wouldn't be easy with the conditions it has. A beam of light can barely pass thought the atmosphere; this causes the standard cameras to be ineffective.

In conclusion, Venus is a very interesting planet and despite the dangers it has, it is worth it to study.

"When people think about that future they think about new phones, watches, TV systems, internet, hoverboards, and all that exciting stuff. But have you ever thought about a driverless car?

Most people think that the position of a driverless car would be amazing. They think that it would make life a lot easier. Would it really make driving easier? I've been asked about my position on a driverless car. My position on a driverless car is that we shouldn't rely on technology for everything we do. In today's society people rely on technology for directions, phone numbers, social media, and sometimes even for school projects. This has led to people using less phone books, maps, books, and even less people meeting in public. This is why we shouldn't rely on technology; which leads to diverless cars. It could lead to unsafe relying on everything.

When it comes to the safety of people how would driverless cars help? Would they actually make it safer? In the article google founder states that the car would alert you if human assistance is needed. What if the system didn't work? The car would automatically shut down and we wouldn't know what to do. Why rely on technology such as driverless cars to hold the safety of us and our family? If we were to get hurt in an accident where the cars' system didn't work who would we blame? This safety hazard that is still not completely trustworthy should not be used on the roads.

When it comes to driverless cars it shouldn't be allowed. It is unsafe and not yet completely reliable. Why put us, our family, and other in risk when we don't know that exact outcome of how the car will operate in a dangerous zone or on a daily basis. When it comes to safety and reliability, we think big on this subject just like we do on trustworthiness.

"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about my high school experience and how it will impact my future. Recently, I've been learning about the pros and cons of graduating from high school in three or four years instead of the traditional four years. This has made me realize that there are many factors to consider when deciding whether to speed up my high school education.

One of the main advantages of graduating early is the educational benefit. By finishing high school faster, I will have more time to focus on my college education and get a head start on my future career. This is especially important for students who know what they want to study and want to get ahead of the game. Additionally, finishing high school early can give me a sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep pushing myself in my academic pursuits.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider. One of the biggest concerns is the financial impact of graduating early. Since I will be finishing high school faster, I may not have as much time to work and save money for college. This could make it harder for me to pay for my education and living expenses. Additionally, some colleges and universities may not accept students who graduate early, so I may have limited options when it comes to choosing a school.

Another factor to consider is the quality of the educational experience. While finishing high school faster may give me more time to focus on my college education, it could also mean that I miss out on important social and extracurricular experiences that are part of the traditional high school experience. For example, I may not have as much time to participate in sports, clubs, or volunteer work, which can be important for building character and networking.

I have also talked to my family members and friends about this idea, and they have mixed opinions. Some of them think it's a great idea and will give me an advantage in the long run, while others are worried that I will miss out on important social experiences. It's important to consider their perspectives and make a decision that works best for me.

In conclusion, while there are both advantages and disadvantages to graduating from high school in three or four years, I believe that it's important to consider my own goals and priorities when making a decision. By weighing the pros and cons",1,436
" Enthusiasm is a powerful force that can greatly impact a person's life. Those who possess a high level of enthusiasm are often more successful and happier, as they have a greater sense of purpose and motivation. On the other hand, those who lack enthusiasm may struggle to find meaning in their lives and may be more prone to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.

People who are enthusiastic are often able to create new and innovative ideas, as they are not limited by negative thoughts and doubts. They are also more likely to be able to help others, as they are more open and receptive to the needs of others. Additionally, enthusiastic individuals are often able to overcome challenges and obstacles with greater ease, as they are more confident and determined in their actions.

On the other hand, those who lack enthusiasm may struggle to find joy in life and may be more prone to feelings of sadness and hopelessness. They may also find it difficult to help others, as they may not have the energy or motivation to do so. Furthermore, those who lack enthusiasm may be more likely to give up on their goals and dreams, as they may not have the drive to push through challenges and obstacles.

It is important to note that enthusiasm is not a fixed trait, and it can be cultivated and developed over time. Those who lack enthusiasm may be able to improve their outlook on life by focusing on the positive aspects of their surroundings and by actively seeking out opportunities for growth and development.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is a powerful force that can greatly impact a person's life. Those who possess a high level of enthusiasm are often more successful and happier, while those who lack enthusiasm may struggle to find meaning and purpose in their lives. By focusing on the positive aspects of life and actively seeking out opportunities for growth and development, it is possible to cultivate enthusiasm and improve one's overall well-being.",1,437
"How would you feel if your principal said it is mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? It could be anything like sports, you could work on the year book, or serve on the student council. Some of you may wonder if this would be a good idea or not to make it mandatory to participate in this activity. In my opinion, I think this would not be a great idea to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. In this essay I will give specific details and examples why I think this wouldn't be a good idea.

One of my reasons why I think that making it mandatory to do an activity isn't a good idea is because of different peoples attitude. Some people may have a great reaction to knowing and some others may not even care because maybe they are in an extracurricular activity now. Others could have a negative reaction to it which could be a problem. A reason why this could be a problem is because if they act negatively to this, they could make it hard on the teacher giving them bad attitudes to the teacher make it a lot stressful for the teacher if the student doesn't want to be there.

Some people may think that this could be a good thing because it could maybe help students in different ways. Being in an extracurricular activity like Sports could maybe help people be more athletic than they already are. To those who want to be athletic being in something like sports could dramatically help them get what they want to accomplish. Being in an extracurricular activity like maybe some kind of math activity could help different people learn what they want or need to learn. Some people could just like it in general because they can do something they always wanted to and now have the chance to.

Lastly another reason why I think this wouldn't be a good idea is because of maybe cause of the parents. What would they do then if a parent of a child doesn't want there child to participate or don't want them to do an extracurricular activity? Then what would the principal do in this kind of problems? These are all things the principal would have to think about before making a decision to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. Another thing you have to think about is if a student has a disorder or has some kind of sickness mentally or physically then what would the principal do?

These are all valuable reasons and things that play a big part in making a big decision like this. The principal has a lot of things to do/ think about before making a decision like this. I gave reasons why this could be a good thing but, I also gave reasoning on my opinion which is to not make this a mandatory thing. Ultimately I think this wouldn't be a good decision at all and this shouldn't be a mandatory thing.",0,438
"I strongly disagree with the school policy that the principal suggested, I say this because we have a lot of talented students in Pittsburgh SCHOOL_NAME who shine bright when they get out on that field or court, and they can express their gift by showing every one what they can do as well as who there destined to be.

With no sports, you have to ask your self well what exactly is there for these guys. School work, student council, instrumental etc. is all cool, but the boys here love sports and that's what they look forward to. Without sports some might not want to attend this school, middle school is where your journey begins, It's were you get recognized early and family and friends come out to see you and most important recruiters.

Now I know you may say the students at SCHOOL_NAME need to focus on there school work and get there grades at decent level, and that I do agree on but on the other hind sometimes a B average, most struggle to get to. It's possible but for most not easy. You may also say if the students get involved in sports with low grades, sports will soon become there first priority, but you can always maintain sports and keep a C average, that's not asking for too much. Get a C average, and you'll want to do better. Just to know your the man in sports and keep your head in the books, hey don't sound too bad to me.

With that being said, all I am asking is for you to look into what I said, either way it's up to you but I hope my reasons can change your choice, are found away to make other options. The boys as well as the girls here, love sports and if you have to keep a B average. Some may not succeed in that. Most will strive to be on the team so much, yet can't keep a B, so they give up on everything, school work and more. We as a Pittsburgh SCHOOL_NAME team wouldn't want that, sports is our way of bonding and creating new friendship, sit back relax and enjoy the game.",0,439
" Car-Free Cities: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction

The rise of car ownership and usage has brought significant changes to society, impacting not only the environment but also the way we live our lives. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the benefits of cars are outweighed by the negative impacts they have on the environment, public health, and urban structure. As such, many countries and cities are implementing policies to limit car usage, such as car-free days, bike-sharing programs, and public transportation incentives. In this essay, I will argue that limiting car usage offers several advantages, including reduced air pollution, improved public health, and more efficient urban planning.

Reduced Air Pollution

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of air pollution. Cars emit harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain. These pollutants not only harm the environment but also pose a serious threat to public health. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to air pollution is responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year in the United States alone.

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce air pollution by reducing the number of cars on the road. For example, the city of Paris banned driving during peak hours on certain days, resulting in a 22% reduction in air pollution. Similarly, the city of Bogotá in Colombia has implemented a car-free day once a week, resulting in a 30% reduction in air pollution. These examples demonstrate that limiting car usage can have a real impact on reducing air pollution and improving public health.

Improved Public Health

In addition to reducing air pollution, limiting car usage can also improve public health. Cars are a major contributor to traffic accidents, which can result in serious injury or death. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were over 36,000 traffic fatalities in the United States in 2019. Limiting car usage can reduce the number of cars on the road, resulting in fewer accidents and saving lives.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can encourage physical activity and improve overall health. Walking, biking, and taking public transportation are all forms of physical activity that can help maintain a healthy lifestyle. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. By reducing car usage, we can encourage people to engage in physical activity and improve their overall health.

More Efficient Urban Planning

Finally, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient urban planning. Cars require large amounts of space, including parking garages, roads, and high",1,440
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is a system in which each state is assigned a number of electors equal to its total number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district.

The Electoral College was created at the 1787 Constitutional Convention as a compromise between those who wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the President to be elected by a popular vote of the people. The Founding Fathers believed that the Electoral College would prevent any one state from having too much power in the election of the President.

However, the Electoral College has several flaws that make it an outdated and undemocratic system. First, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes but lost the election to Donald Trump.

Second, the Electoral College gives more power to voters in some states than in others. For example, a voter in Wyoming has nearly three times as much power as a voter in California because Wyoming has just three electoral votes compared to California's 55 electoral votes.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of ""swing states"" that are up for grabs each election. This means that candidates often ignore the needs of voters in ""safe states"" that are already guaranteed to go to one party or the other.

For these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, and the President should be elected by popular vote. A national popular vote would be more democratic, more fair, and more representative of the will of the people.

I urge you to support legislation that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your name]",1,441
"I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts can help students develop their own opinions and beliefs, which can then help them learn more about the world around them. Additionally, understanding concepts can help students learn about the different types of knowledge and how to use it in their own lives.

For example, if you were to ask a student how many states are in the United States, they would likely be able to answer you. However, if you were to ask them what type of food they like, they may not be able to answer you because they do not know what you are asking. However, if you were to ask them what they think the world will be like in 100 years, they may be able to answer you because they understand concepts like time and space.

Similarly, when it comes to learning about the world, it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts. For example, if you were to ask a student about the world economy, they may not be able to answer you because they do not understand concepts like money. However, if you were to ask them about the world’s climate, they may be able to answer you because they understand concepts like weather and climate.

In conclusion, it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts so that they can better understand the world around them and how to use knowledge in their own lives. Additionally, understanding concepts can help students learn about the different types of knowledge and how to use it in their own lives.

"Chemistry, math, arts, computers, designing the list goes on, in what extracurricular activities you can join! School is a great way to learn, do fun things that interest you, hang out with your friends, and just be you. I think that we should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Because, you can make new friends, do fun activities, and start or join a club that interests you.

Joining sports teams and clubs are a great way to make friends that have the same interests as you do. When you play sports in my opinion, you can have so much fun, and you exercise at the same time! If, you don't like any sports that's okay you could do any club you would like. You can also ask the principle you could probably make your very own club with your friends!

Clubs are ways you can express yourself and take your mind off of things. You can do fun activities like arts and crafts where you can design our yearbook, paint/color, 3D arts, animation, and other things! Also, school related activities for example mathematics, science, Civics, English, Algebra, or History. You can start clubs for what you want to be when you're older! Help our school out and win decathlons or spelling bees! The list pretty much goes on. If you have an interest make a club! It's like a community were you can feel like you belong.

It should be the students call though, if they want to join a club or sport. Doing something they don't want to do is not a good idea. But, it would be a good opportunity to be a part of something. I'm honestly so glad my mom forced me to do volleyball because, I have made so many friends and started club volleyball now! I would have never thought I would do volleyball. It's a hobby now that I love, and I'm going to be doing it until college!

Participating in school extracurricular activities is a good idea. This can help you decide what you want to do in life, also find new hobbies. Trying something new is very important in life. Making friends and a community were you belong is a great thing for students. That is a placed were you can just express yourself. So, that they can enjoy school even more! ",0,443
"""LET ME GO!"" Generic_Name shouted. Generic_Name was struggling to escape the breathtaking choke hold she was in. Her mind flooded with horrendous thoughts. Generic_Name's date was trying to kidnap her. While she was fighting for her life, all she could think about was how she regretted meeting up with this dangerous, strange man. In hope to find a partner, Generic_Name downloaded a dating app. She was aware of the risks of chatting with and meeting strangers, but she was not bothered by it. Generic_Name was going to seek opinions from her close friends, but she knew they would not approve. Generic_Name felt that since she was an adult, it was her duty make her own decisions, and deal with the consequences of the validation of others. She soon found out that her decision was a bad idea. Generic_Name should have asked for her friends' opinions in making the decision to meet up with a stranger from a dating app. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by introducing their mind to different points of views, seeing how options weigh out, and gaining wisdom from others.

Introducing a person's mind to different points of views can help the person make a better choice. While making a decision, it is important to seek advice from others. Being introduced to how different people would handle a situation or make a choice, can help a person make a more beneficial choice. For example, if Generic_Name had asked three of her friends how they felt about the dating app, the scary situation in the beginning possibly could have been prevented. One friend could have told her to be careful and bring protection just in case, the other may have suggested meeting up in a public area with a numerous amount of people, and the other friend could have listed all the dangers about meeting with strangers. A couple of her friends could have mentioned to her how they would meet up with someone safely, and the other friend could have opened her mind to scary perspectives of meeting with a man online. Generic_Name would have made a better choice if she had considered the different points of views. Be aware of whom you take advice from. Always make sure the person that is introducing you to different point of views is someone you can put your trust into.

Seeing how options weigh out can help some make a better choice too. To further explain, when you weigh out options you are determining how one decision or choice you make can be more beneficial than the other choice or decision. If Generic_Name would have gone to a trusting adult or relative, they could have informed her about the pros and cons of dating apps. They could have informed her about the number of kidnaps or deaths that relate to dating apps, or the low number of striving relationships. With that knowledge, Generic_Name could have weighed out her options. She could have used that knowledge to make a better choice. For example, Generic_Name's options were to be single and discontinue the use of the dating app, or meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship. If the cons seemed worse on the ''meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship'' side, than she would have weighed out her options, and chosen to be single. When you weigh out your options, make sure you have full knowledge on all possible choices.

Finally, gaining wisdom from others is another way for someone to make a better choice. When someone shares their wisdom with you, it can alter the way you think or perceive things. All it takes is a wise individual to share their thoughts and advice with you, for you to make a better choice. Generic_Name could have possibly talked to her mother, or a wise person in her life and asked them for their intake or thoughts about her dating app situation. Gaining advice from someone who is wiser than you can make you deeply consider your choices. If a wise person in Generic_Name's life would have told her not to force relationships or just wait on your true love to appear, she would have deleted the app and been patient. When you look up to someone, especially if their wise, you take what they say into a deeper understanding. When gaining wisdom from others, take it into deep consideration.

Sparkling lights filled the room while blush colored flowers made a trail down the isle. The room had a peachy aroma. People slowly entered the church and the murmurs of voices were filling the air. Generic_Name was in the back dressing room getting her large, white gown fitted on her body. She was getting married to the love of her life. Generic_Name was a dove. Generic_Name was graceful and delicate. Nobody could ruin her day""Generic_Name its almost time to walk,"" Generic_Name's father called out. She could hear the soft music playing. Butterflies fluttered around in her stomach. She could not believe how almost four months ago she was going to meet up with a man from a dating website. The thought made her body cringe. If she had gone on that date, she would have never met her soon-to-be husband. Generic_Name was in love and happier than she had ever been. She was so glad she listened to the opinions and advice from her friends and family. Introducing someone's mind to different points of views, seeing how options weigh out, and gaining wisdom from others are always seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice.",0,444
"Studying Venus has the good and the bad. You find out so much about your planet and others. Like whybdonthey call Venus an ""Evening Star"" when it's actually a planet. With Venus being proven a very challenging place to examine, is hard to find out more about it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite that dangers.

One of the big dangers studying Venus is the temperature. Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The planets' temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than then on our planet. The conditions are way more extreme than what we've encountered on Earth. In addition to the heat there's erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

We could be living on Venus. Venus has the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus used to be covered with oceans that could've supported various forms of life. Even today Venus has rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is an option for a planetary visit.

There are solutions for the temperature. NASA's solution is to let scientist float above the fray. A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case it's a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800-degree surface. The vehicle would be thirty-plus miles above the surface. Solar power would be plentiful ANC radiation would not exceed Earth levels, survivable but not easy conditions.

Trying to meet the challenge by Venus has value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us to many intimidating endeavors. With the dangers studying Venus, helps us in case we need to move to another planet. Studying Venus is dangerous but, it has its perks.  ",0,445
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Working Alone vs. Working in a Group: Which is Better?

As an 8th grader, I've had my fair share of both individual and group projects. While working with others can be fun and exciting, I believe that working alone has more benefits than working in a group.

First, when you work alone, you can focus better on the task at hand. There are fewer distractions and interruptions when you're working by yourself, which means you can get more done in less time. For example, when I'm working on a science project, I can concentrate on the experiment without having to worry about what my group members are doing. This helps me to think more clearly and come up with better ideas.

Another benefit of working alone is that you can learn more about the topic. When you're working in a group, you might not have as much time to research and learn about the topic as you would if you were working alone. But when you're working alone, you can take your time to read and learn as much as you want, which can help you to understand the topic better. For instance, when I was working on a history project, I was able to spend more time reading about the topic and learning new things, which helped me to get a better grade.

Working alone can also lead to more creativity. When you're working with others, you might feel like you have to conform to their ideas and opinions. But when you're working alone, you can let your imagination run wild and come up with unique and innovative ideas. For example, when I was working on a writing project, I was able to come up with a story that was completely different from what my group members had come up with, and it turned out to be one of the best parts of the project.

Finally, working alone can help you to develop your time management skills. When you're working with others, it can be easy to get distracted and fall behind schedule. But when you're working alone, you have to be more responsible and manage your time better. For instance, when I was working on a math project, I had to make sure I finished my part on time, which helped me",1,446
"Before the invention and widespread use of technology, finding a job, shopping, and communication between people took a great deal of time and effort. People had to manually search for job postings, travel to physical stores to purchase items, and wait for weeks or months for a letter or package to arrive. 

However, with the introduction of technology, all of these tasks have become much easier. It is now possible to find job postings online and submit applications with just the click of a button. Shopping can be done with the help of digital stores, where items can be sent directly to a person's door. Finally, communication has been greatly improved by technology, allowing people to connect with others around the world at the speed of light. 

Technology has drastically improved the lives of people in the United States, making finding a job, shopping, and communication much simpler and more efficient than it was before it existed. The impact of technology on society has been profound, and its advantages can be seen in almost every aspect of our lives.",1,447
"Hey, guys! So, I'm here to argue that people should make their own decisions instead of relying on the guidance of ""experts"". Like, think about it, when we let others make decisions for us, we're basically giving up our power and control over our own lives. And, let's be real, who knows better than us what we want and need?

For instance, have you ever noticed how sometimes doctors can be super wrong about stuff? Like, my friend's mom went to the doctor because she was feeling really sick, and the doctor told her she was just stressed and needed to take some deep breaths. Turns out, she had a really serious illness and almost died! If she had just listened to her own body and gone to the hospital when she first started feeling sick, she might not have been in that situation.

Another time, my dad was trying to decide which college to send me to, and some ""expert"" counselor told him that I would be much happier at a certain school because it was ""better"" for kids like me. But, like, I had my own ideas about what I wanted to study and where I wanted to go, and it turned out that the counselor was totally wrong. I ended up loving my college and having the best time ever!

And, let's not forget about the whole ""experts"" can be biased thing. Like, they might have their own agendas or be influenced by certain groups, and they might not always have our best interests at heart. I mean, have you seen how some politicians just make decisions based on what their rich donors want? That's not cool, you know?

So, yeah, I think it's super important to trust our own instincts and make our own decisions. It's like, we're the ones who know ourselves best, right? And, if we don't speak up and make our own choices, then we're just going to end up with decisions that don't really benefit us.

In conclusion, I think it's pretty clear that relying on ""experts"" can lead to some pretty bad outcomes. So, let's all just be more aware of that and start making our own DEC",1,448
"Technology seems to advance further and further everyday. We see new pieces of software and devices coming out fairly often. Although this technology is created, many people have opinions on how it will actually help in the long run. With the Facial Action Coding System, I believe this software is going to help in many ways. It will make all kinds of positive change in the classroom and even in places of work.

One positive change I believe it would make is to help children learn in the classroom. Kids have a tendency to get bored in class while learning, and often stop paying attention. This is a bad habit that can easily be fixed with the Facial Action Coding System. This software can detect change in emotion and help keep things interesting in the classroom. The author, Nick D'Alto, states that,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This software is the perfect way to always have the attention of students.

Another reason I think this Facial Action coding System is extremely valuable in the classroom is because it works with children all over the world. I believe that is extremely important. Children all over the world will be getting a higher education while having a better experience, because their school time will be spent learning about things they enjoy, and not staring a screen with blank minds. D'Alto writes that, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" So this software can be used anywhere and on anyone very efficiently.

Although this software has some great benefits, it also has a downfall. One problem with the Facial Action Coding system is the price. I'm sure given the amount of details and time put into it, it comes with a bit of a price tag. Some schools may not be able to afford it. This is still a great product though, and it should still be available to the schools that can afford it. Many schools would find this to be helpful, and most likely invest. Eventually, as the software becomes more common, access to it will become easier and the price will not be a problem.

While most technology has a few slight inconveniences, this software only seems to have one. The Facial Action Coding System seems to be extremely innovative. I hope to see this product in schools soon, available to children. The boredom and confusion of these children will no longer exist, which will make these kids all the happier to go to school and continue their education.  ",0,449
"It is important to understand the ways in which you can influence another person. There is a difference between talking to someone about your personal experience versus talking softly and calmly about their behavior. When discussing your experience, you may get the person to empathize with your point of view and possibly adjust their behavior accordingly. Talking softly and calmly focuses more on pushing the person towards a goal. This method is gentler and can encourage the other person to act in the desired way. Regardless of the approach, it is important to consider the consequences of both methods and to choose wisely.",1,450
"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay about why people should make their own decisions and how it can give them more freedom. Like, I know some people might be like, ""Ugh, I don't want to make my own decisions, I'll just let others do it for me,"" but trust me, it's way better to make your own choices.

First, when you make your own decisions, you're in control of your own life. You don't have to rely on anyone else to make choices for you, which means you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. It's like, super liberating, you know? You don't have to worry about what other people think or what they want you to do. You can just do what feels right for you, and that's it.

And another thing is, when you make your own decisions, you learn so much more about yourself. Like, you might discover things about yourself that you never knew before, like your values or your beliefs. And that's, like, super important for your personal growth and development. You can't learn that stuff if you're just following other people's decisions all the time.

Plus, when you make your own decisions, you're showing respect for yourself. Like, you're saying, ""Hey, I know what's best for me, and I'm going to do it."" It's like, a form of self-love, you know? And who doesn't want to love themselves more?

Now, some people might be like, ""But what about when other people make better decisions than you?"" And I'm like, ""Dude, that's not the point."" The point is, you should make your own decisions and stand by them, even if they're not the best decisions in the world. At least you'll know that you made them yourself, and you can be proud of that.

In conclusion, making your own decisions is way better than letting other people make them for you. It gives you freedom, helps you learn more about yourself, and shows respect for yourself. So, like, go ahead and make your own decisions, and don't let anyone else tell",1,451

We are living in a society where new thing are being made every day, just like the new cool hover bored.

There are many pros to the new invention people are coming out with. Several of the ones I have herd are about how they will make life a lot easier. For example look at the new hover bored, a flat surface that can move right left back forward yes this make life easier, but it also effects us. You could be walking places that will give you good exercise.

When you take a look at car driving themself that is kinda scary though. Just image what could happen if the car took a wrong turn and there was a big trailer coming that could be your last day alive. We see on television and movies that have long been fascinated with cast hat could drive themselves but that is all but in reality that is all fantasy made by a computer. This world has taken it a step to far on how we are just being here for nothing why don't we just have computer do everything. Because that is what it looks like.

In conclusion, I feel that this is a very hard topic to argue about became yes I would like to make life easier but at the same time I want it to be safe. I feel like we should be taken life nice and slow and more car driving on their own for a bit further in the future.  ",0,453
"Dear principal

I think that the principals shouldn't make all the students to perform community service, because maybe it would be good for other people, but some students don't have the time to do that, because maybe they need to take care of their little brother when their parents are going somewhere and can't take the children with them, and they don't have the money to pay a babysitter or they don't have any related to take care of them. Maybe the students don't want to do it, because they can't do it, because they want to hang out with their friends, go to the movies, or go to the park and play some kind of sport, or maybe they want to hang out with their girlfriend. If you make all the students to do community service, some are not going to go, because they got to take care of the little kids, or because they don't want to and that's going to cause more problems in the school and the students are going to get detention, because they didn't do their community service. Also, if you force them to do community service its like they have no rights to make their own decisions. Maybe some students want to do community service, but that doesn't mean that all the student should be doing community service. That's why I think that the principals shouldn't make all the student to perform community service.",0,454
"Last week, I had a math test on my first period. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. Furthermore, I was tired and tensed. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

Those who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons.

They sometimes say students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class.

However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Again, if I'm not at home or maybe I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes.

Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. One example is that, if I don't need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. Again, I can finish my school works quickly and take other courses which can help me in my future career or, maybe I can do some other activities I like.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. Online classes can help us in many ways. Not only it will save our time, but also it can give us opportunity to do a lot of extra activities and enjoy the day.",0,455
" In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards limiting car usage in various cities around the world. The idea behind this is that it can have numerous benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting a more active and healthy lifestyle. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of limiting car usage and provide evidence to support this claim.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is that it can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, and reducing car usage can help to decrease the amount of harmful gases released into the atmosphere. According to a study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), transportation is responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can help to mitigate the negative impact that transportation has on the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can improve air quality. In many cities, car emissions are a major cause of air pollution, which can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. By limiting car usage, we can help to reduce the amount of harmful pollutants in the air, which can lead to cleaner, healthier air for everyone. For example, in Paris, a partial driving ban was implemented in 2014 due to high levels of smog, and this led to a significant reduction in air pollution.

Limiting car usage can also promote a more active and healthy lifestyle. By reducing the amount of time people spend driving, we can encourage them to engage in more physical activities such as walking, biking, or using public transportation. This can lead to improved cardiovascular health, reduced obesity, and a lower risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. In the town of Vauban, Germany, for example, residents are encouraged to use public transportation, walk, or bike rather than drive, and this has led to a more active and healthy community.

While there are many advantages to limiting car usage, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. One possible issue is that it may be difficult for people to give up their cars entirely, especially if they need to commute to work or run errands on a regular basis. Additionally, some people may find it inconvenient or expensive to use public transportation or other alternative methods of transportation.

Despite these potential drawbacks, there are many examples of cities and towns that have successfully implemented car-free or car-limited policies, and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents are encouraged to use public transportation, walk, or bike rather than drive, and this has led to a more active and healthy community. In Paris, a partial driving ban was implemented in 20",1,456
"Driverless cars. Are they really the future of transportation? I don't think so. Sure, they might seem like a good idea, but let's think about it.

First, driverless cars are going to take away our freedom. We won't be able to just hop in our car and go wherever we want, whenever we want. We'll have to rely on a machine to take us where we want to go. And what if it breaks down? Or what if it gets hacked? We'll be stuck.

Plus, driverless cars are going to be so expensive. Only rich people will be able to afford them. And what about all the jobs that will be lost? Truck drivers, taxi drivers, delivery drivers, they'll all be out of work. That's not fair.

And have you thought about the safety issues? There's already been accidents with driverless cars. What if there's a glitch and the car crashes? Who's going to be responsible? The manufacturer? The owner? It's just too risky.

I know some people think driverless cars will reduce traffic and pollution, but I don't think it's worth the risk. We need to focus on making public transportation better, not relying on machines to take us around.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not the future of transportation. They're going to take away our freedom, cost too much, and pose safety risks. We need to focus on better, safer ways to get around.",1,457

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you to express my opinion on whether the Electoral College should be kept or changed to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After reading the texts provided, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be kept.

The Electoral College ensures that every state has a voice in the election of the president. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, candidates would only focus on campaigning in the most populous states, leaving smaller states without any say in the election. The Electoral College also prevents a candidate from winning the presidency by only winning the most populous states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College has been in place since the founding of our country and has been successful in electing presidents. Changing to a popular vote system would require amending the Constitution, which is a difficult and lengthy process.

While some may argue that the popular vote is a more fair system, it is important to consider the potential consequences of such a change. The Electoral College ensures that the president is elected by a diverse group of people from different states, rather than just the most populous ones.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place for the election of the President of the United States. It ensures that every state has a voice in the election and prevents candidates from only focusing on the most populous states. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion on this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,459
"Who think

Dear Senator

I heard recently that you might be taking away the electoral college.  If you don't know already the electoral college is a process founded by our founding fathers in the constitution.  In the article ""In defense of the electoral college"" they say,""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.  So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality the states that he knows he will win."" this keeps the election 'fair' and the candidates can't just pick a region and ""take over.""

I understand that when you use the Electoral college system you vote not for the president but for a slate.  Allthought this is your still putting your vote towards a president.

In the article ""In defense of the electoral college""the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that the large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution.  The Electoral college keeps the votes balance in the states.  These are some reasons you should consider before you take away the Electoral college, and remember like source 3 say ""voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.""

"I believe it is very important to limit car use on the road. People even are starting to sell their cars for example 70 percent of Vauban families do not own a car people say it is less stress full without a car and easier

Limiting Car Usage Benefits Communities 

Relying less on personal vehicles and more on alternative modes of transportation provides numerous advantages for citizens and communities. According to the given passages, reducing car dependency can positively impact both the environment and public health. It also encourages healthier lifestyle choices and strengthened social connections.  

One of the primary benefits of limiting car usage is improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in passage 1, transportation accounts for approximately one-quarter of total emissions in many countries. By driving less and opting for walking, cycling, or public transit instead, individuals can help curb pollution and mitigate the environmental effects of climate change. This leads to fresher, cleaner air that is safer to breathe for all.

In addition, decreasing the number of vehicles on the road lowers traffic congestion and commuting times. As stated in passage 2, people who live in areas with comprehensive public transit systems drive 25% less and spend half as much time getting to work compared to those reliant solely on cars. Less time idling in traffic means less wear and tear on infrastructure as well as nerves. It also allows for increased productivity throughout the day.

Further, curbing car dependence promotes active lifestyles. As passage 3 notes, walkable, biteable cities encourage physical exercise and time outdoors as the primary modes of transportation. This can have widespread health benefits like reducing risks for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Regular activity also boosts mental wellbeing through stress relief. 

Finally, non-motorized commuting fosters closer community ties. The third passage discusses how public spaces used for transit become areas for social interaction. More foot and bicycle traffic on streets and sidewalks tends to make neighborhoods feel safer and build stronger relationships among residents. A sense of belonging is important for individual and community prosperity.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through expanded public transit options and alternative methods of travel produces several advantages. It protects environmental health, eases traffic burdens, promotes fitness, and strengthens social fabrics. Adopting a less auto-centric approach can significantly benefit both citizens and communities as a whole.",1,463
"To Whom It May Concern,

Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times would be a great cell phone policy in my opinion. I believe this is best because a lot of students have cell phones and there are many reasons they can use them.

Being able to use cell phones during lunch and other free times is great. For instance someone could have forgotten something very important that they may need to have for that day and instead of having to walk all the way through the hallways to go to the front office and possibly disturb any of the other activities going on, they can pull out their cell phones and ask their parents or whom ever has what they need to bring it to them.

Emergencies don't happen that often at school, but if one day everybody was doing there normal routine then someone gets hurt, and it's a awful injury a student can take out their phones and call for help. Like if the students are outside waiting to get into school or waiting for someone to pick them up and something happens that would be a good time to use it to.

If there's ever any free time in class and the teacher just want to finish up some work instead of hearing the students complain that they have nothing to do, and they have finished everything, the teacher can let them use their phones for a couple of minutes until the bell ring, or they have finished.

Some may not agree with these reasons, but they may have an effect on the decision he or she makes.

Sincerely,

A Student",0,464
"Upon graduating from high school, students are often faced with many potential career paths. One of the most popular post-secondary routes is to go to college to pursue further studies in a given field of interest. This can provide job opportunities in a variety of fields, such as accounting, engineering, and law. The benefits to this include the potential for higher salary prospects, greater job security, and the experience of pursuing more specialized training. On the flip side, there is also the financial commitment and technical aptitude required to complete some of these courses.

Alternately, students can take on an apprenticeship in order to receive on-the-job training in a desired field. This pathway provides the student with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience alongside more experienced professionals and a potential salary while doing so. The potential downsides to this approach are the initially lower wages compared to those of university graduates, and some jobs in this field may be harder to secure and stability may be lower in comparison. 

It is important to ensure that students have access to a variety of career choices in order to assist them in making an informed decision. Schools should provide guidance to students in order to ensure they are educated on the various job opportunities available to them. It is important for students to attend school in order to gain a good education which can help them to achieve future success. With the right combination of post-secondary studies and on-the-job training, students can be encouraged to strive for a successful career.",1,465
"Summer projects are a painful, but necessary experience that many students have to face as they continue their academic careers in middle and high school. Teachers understand that without these projects, students could lose much of their academic progress that they have made throughout the year, and so these projects become necessary evils that make Summer slightly less enjoyable. However, while these projects are often necessary, there is some debate as to how they should be executed. Some argue for a student-based project experience, while others say that teachers should be the ones in charge of these assignments. However, the latter option would be easier for everyone and more effective, providing an organized project environment that would hold students accountable for their work.

With teacher-based Summer projects, both students and teachers would suffer less stress and be able to more easily complete their tasks. For students, having specific instructions on what to do for a project removes one of the hardest obstacles that student-based projects would make them face: actually designing a project from start to finish. When students have instructions, they already know what to do, and they avoid the stress of having to figure it out on their own. Summer projects should be as stress-free as possible for students, and to achieve this goal, the teacher-based project is preferable. In addition, the teacher-based project would put less stress on the teacher. With a student-based project, the teacher would have a difficult experience while trying to grade each of the projects, because the parameters and expectations of the project would be less specific. Thus, the teacher would not be able to objectively assess the quality of the work that the students are actually doing, and they would have to take an individual approach to each project. With a teacher-based project, the teacher gives the students specific instructions, making grades easier to give because the teacher can assess each project with the same expectations and objectively give each student the grade they deserve. Teacher-based projects make the lives of both students and teachers easier, and they should be utilized in order to make Summer and the start of the school year less stressful.

In addition, the teacher-based approach makes the start of the school year organized, with all students having learned or reviewed the same topics over their summer. For example, when a teacher wants students to review mathematics over the summer, they should provide a worksheet of review questions for students to complete. With this type of project, students all review the same exact questions, putting themselves all in similar places academically when the school year starts. If that same teacher tells their students to simply complete some mathematics questions over the summer, without giving them specific questions, students will all review different topics; some will review the more advanced topics, and some will review less advanced ones. When the school year rolls around, the students will all be in different places. This would make things harder for both the teacher and student. The teacher would have to review all the topics in detail because otherwise, they would be leaving some students behind. With a teacher-based project, the teacher has the ability to make sure that all students are on the same level at the start of the school year. This makes the start of the year much more organized and puts students in a strong position to continue learning without being hindered by the different levels of review done by their peers.

However, some may say that the student-based project is beneficial because it gives students the opportunity to learn about topics that actually interest them. While this is one of the biggest arguments for the student-based project, it is based on faulty logic. If a student is genuinely interested in a topic, then they will learn about it without being prompted. Student-based projects ask students to come up with a topic that they are interested in, but they limit that topic to a certain subject barrier, such as English, Mathematics, Science, or History. Many students are not interested in anything that is limited to these subjects. Thus, this idea that student-based projects inspire a greater creativity and trigger a passion for learning is flawed. Some students may end up finding something that they are truly interested in, but many others are left struggling to come up with a topic and doing the bare minimum to complete a project based on that topic.

Furthermore, students are more easily held accountable for their work with teacher-based projects. If every student has to complete the same steps, then they will have a greater tendency to actually do the work. There are no loopholes, and all students will have to do the same amount of work. This lessens the workload for those who naturally overachieve, and holds the rest of students accountable for their work. Overall, it makes things equal for students, setting a good precedent for all students to work hard and achieve what they need to be successful.

The teacher-based project is beneficial for both students and teachers in many ways, and it is vastly superior to the student-based project. It leaves all students with an equal review of their subjects, and makes teachers able to start the school year without having to worry about differences in the academic knowledge of their students. This type of summer project should be the most implemented in order to give students and teachers a good environment for success at the start of the school year. ",0,466

"Does the Electoral College work? Are you happy with a group of electors choosing your president? I write this letter to you, our state senator, because, like many other U.S. citizens or residents, I have my own opinion. I am in favor of the idea of changing to popular vote. Electoral College does not work, it is unfair to voters because a president with the highest popular vote could not win, and it could be ""disaster factor"". Many are familiar with this term: ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens""What Is the Electoral College?,1, but how does it benefit us? Does it express our opinions and preferences?

Let's go back in time to the election of 2000, The candidate with the most popular votes was Gore, therefore, everyone was expecting him to win. The majority was happy with the outcome until they counted the electoral votes, Bush had more electors on his side than Gore. Nobody understood why, they gave the country the president less wanted. Despite the fact that it was the first time since 1888, because it happened once and for sure it could happen again, Why did all those people voted if they got the president they didn't trust to rule their country? In History class, my teacher told us: ""This country's foundation is for the people to rule the government, in other places like Italia, Argentina, Spain, etc. the government takes care of the people, like it, they were our parents."" I believe we stay true to the foundations and let the people choose the president they want.

""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system alloys for much worse""Plume,1. This quote is based on 1960,when people who favored separation based on race nearly Democratic electors were replaced with the ones who would oppose Kennedy. Many electors make a last minute change in their decision, and they decide to go over to the other side and vote against their original choice, the party's candidate. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors""Poster,1.

Another reason why this system should be abolished is the winnertakeall system. The candidates do not spend time in the states in which they believe they have no chance of winning. States had not even seen the candidate and in some cases, they even haven't seen a poster. For example, Plume says in an expert from ""Mother Jones"" that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and Both California, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a dingle campaign add."" The Electoral College system is unfair to the voters.

Overall, My beliefs and the beliefs of hundreds is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters because it can be the cause of some major disaster, and it can choose the candidate the public is not Harry with. The votes are people who want to express, or show, political preferences, people who are determines to change their country for good, so give them the right to do it.

"Dear Principal,

Other students, including me, would like to request that we do not want to have at least a grade B average just so we can participate in sports or other activities. We say that it's not right to make a policy change, the way the policy is right now is just great, but the only suggestion is, to not make that new policy, for not all of us have the grades, and we do not want it or need it. If the reason for changing the policy, is because of our C averages and below, is the problem, well there can be other kinds, and different arrangements. For an example, lunch tutoring, or after school tutoring can be the solution but by taking away our activities and sports just because we need more B averages, isn't the proper way. We need to have these activities and sports, so we can be more active and healthy. So I'd consider announcing some other better way to changing the policy before students start arguing and denying it.

The studies that they researchers have made so far is that"" Long ago, the planet Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Based on the text we can see that the next planet's fascinating, according to the passage it is really hard to get just one foot on Venus, you won't even last a minute or more, we can see it's impossible to land on it. But that doesn't affect scientists. The writer said that ""It's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets..., and the temperatures average are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" But it does not matter to them.

In the fourth paragraph the writer state that the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and"" It includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable for scientists,""but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" That's the questions they're asking themselves until today.

NASA have been testing some electronics made of silicon carbide at higher temperature in a chamber, the same as Venus's, and it lasted for three weeks in those conditions, they're still believing in landing on Venus, because ""human curiosity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" said the author.",0,470
"Successful people often take risks to reach their goals, instead of relying solely on the things they know how to do well. I strongly agree with this statement and believe that taking risks is essential in order to succeed.

Firstly, successful people often have the courage to try new things and take risks. For example, in the business world, it is common for entrepreneurs to take risks to develop new products and services that may be successful in the future. These individuals are willing to go outside their comfort zones and try something new. Taking risks is also seen in the investment world, as successful investors often take on risky investments that have the potential for high reward.

Secondly, taking risks can help to build a person’s confidence and motivate them to take more risks in the future. Those who take risks and succeed can experience a boost in their self-esteem and the feeling of accomplishment that comes from achieving a goal. This in turn encourages them to continue taking risks and pushing themselves further in order to achieve success.

Thirdly, taking risks allows people to expand their knowledge and skills. Trying something new and taking risks can help individuals learn new things and gain valuable experience. For example, a person may take a risk to apply for a job in a field they are unfamiliar with, which could open up new career opportunities and help them develop a new skill set.

Finally, taking risks is essential for those who want to succeed. Those who only rely on their existing skills may not experience the level of success they desire. Taking risks and trying new things allows individuals to experience growth and progress in their lives. Successful people often have the courage to take risks and try new things, even when the outcome may not be certain.

In conclusion, successful people often take risks in order to reach their goals, instead of relying on the things they already know how to do well. Taking risks can help people build their confidence, expand their knowledge, and achieve success. Therefore, I strongly agree that successful people should try new things and take risks rather than relying only on what they already know.

"Limiting car usage can be a good effect but also can cause a lot of stress. In source 2 it tells how on Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would get fine with a $30 dollar charge. And it happened to odd numbered plates the next day. I don't think that's a good thing to go by because some people might have jobs hoe are they supposed to go to work? Other than a city bus.

Source 3 tells me In German Suburb they do things without cars. And it says that 70 percent of Vauban's families don't own cars. And the people who do have cars 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are responsible for it. Source 2 also talks about an even that they have that last all day. The event is to not use cars during the whole day. Lots of other countries thought that it was a good idea, so they joined into the event. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that started in Bogota in the mid-1990s.",0,472
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College system was established to avoid ""the tyranny of the majority,"" recent events have shown that it can undermine the principle of one person, one vote.

Some argue that the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that in recent elections, candidates focus their attention only on swing states that could vote either way. States that lean heavily Democratic or Republican receive relatively little attention. This disadvantages voters in those states. A popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign across the entire country and appeal to more Americans. 

It is also true that the Electoral College system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. In 2000 and 2016, this exact scenario occurred - the candidate who received the most votes nationally did not become president. This undermines the perception that the winner has a clear mandate from the voters. A president seen as lacking a mandate may face greater difficulty implementing their agenda. Moving to a popular vote would ensure that every vote carries the same weight and that the candidate preferred by the most Americans wins.

Some argue that smaller states would lose influence under a popular vote system. However, candidates would still need to appeal to voters across various regions and demographic groups to win. A straight popular vote does not mean that candidates would focus only on highly populated areas. They would still need to consider the interests of citizens in diverse states. 

In conclusion, while the Electoral College may have made sense historically, it no longer serves its original purpose and can undermine public confidence in elections. A national popular vote is a more democratic system that would encourage higher voter turnout and ensure that every American's voice is equally represented in choosing the president. I encourage you to support a transition to electing the president by popular vote.",1,473
"Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens. I think that we should change the way we vote by changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. I feel that this is a good idea and a good way to vote, let me tell you why. It's a good idea because it benefits the public, everyone knows exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it doesn't mess up the votes and or voting. Let's continue, shall we?

It's a good idea because it benefits to the public. The public wants to know exactly who and what they are voting for, they want to know exactly what their vote means to the election. More than half of the time they don't notice what kind of impact a vote can make or what exactly they are voting for. Also, when they do elect a President, the end up getting mad over their finances or taxes because the President that they voted for affected it negatively. They wanted to elect him because they wanted a better economy, to benefit them, not to restrict them from not having what they want. This is only my first reason, I have two more to go.

Another reason of why I believe that it's a good idea is because it lets the public know what kind of impact they're exactly making on the election. We all don't want to vote and not know what kind of impact our vote can make. We want to know that we can make a difference on whom we're voting for, or who we vote for. They want to know and be sure if they vote for let's say ""Billy Henderson"" that he will lower gas prices and boost the economy, make this world a better place and help all the needy, instead of ""Robert Meringue"" who will maybe to this and maybe do that. We want to know for sure what we're voting on and how much of a difference it can make. Not to be worried about if it won't happen.

The last reason I have to give for why this is a good idea is so that it does not mess up the voting process. According to the Gallup pole in the 2,000, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what I'm talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote.

Well, there you have it. My reasons are final. I feel that we should change the voting process because it would benefit the public, so everyone can know exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it does not mess up the voting process. Don't do it for the government. Do it for your own sake. If you want to make a difference, be on my side, and we can. Together. Now my only question to you is, are you willing to make a difference?

" Working alone can be a daunting task, especially when you have a chance to work with a group like Common! Working in a group can be incredibly beneficial, as it allows you to get your work done quickly and efficiently. ""Who doesn't want that? I know I do."" With a group, you can interact and discuss your work with your peers, and receive valuable feedback.

One of the benefits of working in a group is the ability to collaborate and share ideas. When working alone, it can be challenging to come up with new and innovative ideas, but with a group, you have the opportunity to bounce ideas off each other and create something truly amazing.

Another advantage of working in a group is the ability to learn from others. When working with a diverse group of people, you can gain valuable insights and perspectives that you may not have considered before. This can lead to new ideas and a more well-rounded understanding of the project at hand.

While working in a group can be beneficial, it is important to be mindful of potential distractions. For example, there may be that one person in the group who is not contributing and is simply wasting time. However, it is important to remember that every group has its own dynamics, and it is up to the individual to navigate these dynamics and make the most of the experience.

In conclusion, working in a group can be incredibly beneficial, as it allows for collaboration, idea sharing, and learning from others. While there may be potential distractions, the benefits of working in a group far outweigh the challenges. Whether you are working on a school project or participating in a high-end business group, working in a group is a valuable and rewarding experience.",1,475
"Adopting a 10 P.M. weekday curfew for teenagers can be viewed as both advantageous and disadvantageous. On the one hand, instituting a curfew could lead to improved safety, by providing greater supervision for teenagers after dark, and ensuring they don’t remain in dangerous or unfamiliar areas. It can also help promote better sleeping and eating habits, leaving teenagers more rested and alert for their daily activities. On the other hand, a 10 P.M. curfew can be seen as overly restrictive, leaving teens feeling as though they have limited freedom and unable to participate in evening activities. It can also detract from academic performance as teens may be unable to participate in extracurricular activities or study later in the night and as such, it may put them at a disadvantage. 

Overall, it is clear that enforcing a 10 P.M. curfew for teenagers has both its pros and cons, but ultimately it should be decided on a case-by-case basis. If a curfew is deemed necessary, authorities should consider the importance of communication, extracurricular involvement, and overall wellbeing to ensure that teens are getting the most out of their time after dark.",1,476
"Taking classes from home has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. There are numerous benefits to learning from the comfort of your own home, including convenience, flexibility, and increased productivity. In this essay, I will explore these benefits in detail and discuss why taking classes from home is a good idea for students of all ages.

First and foremost, taking classes from home provides convenience. With online classes, students can attend lectures and complete assignments from the comfort of their own home, without having to worry about commuting to a physical campus. This eliminates the need for students to wake up early, pack a bag, and spend time on public transportation. Instead, they can focus on their studies and complete their work at their own pace.

Another benefit of taking classes from home is flexibility. Online classes often offer a variety of scheduling options, allowing students to attend lectures and complete assignments at times that work best for their individual needs. This is particularly helpful for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities. With online classes, students can balance their studies with their other obligations and still succeed academically.

Finally, taking classes from home can increase productivity. When students are able to learn from the comfort of their own home, they are often more focused and motivated to complete their work. Without the distractions of a busy campus, students can concentrate on their studies and achieve their academic goals. Additionally, online classes often provide students with access to a variety of resources, such as online tutoring and study groups, which can further enhance their learning experience.

Not having to leave home is also a significant advantage of taking classes from home. Students can learn in a comfortable and familiar environment, without the stress and anxiety that often comes with attending a physical campus. This can lead to a more enjoyable and stress-free learning experience, which can ultimately lead to better academic performance.

Parents can also be more trusting of students who take classes from home. When students are able to complete their work from the comfort of their own home, parents can be confident that their children are spending their time studying and completing their assignments. This can lead to a greater sense of trust and security for both parents and students.

In addition, being unable to be absent is a positive effect of taking classes from home. With online classes, students can attend lectures and complete assignments from anywhere with an internet connection",1,477
"Some reasons why being a sea cowboy is a good idea. It is very occupational, working the stables and feeding the animals makes the trip seem less long. There are very many sights to see, such as, taking relaxing gondola rides in Venice, touring excavated sites like the elegant castles in Crete, seeing the famous Acropolis in Greece. There are many more exotic and beautiful structures to be seen as a Seagoing Cowboy. Along the way gift shops and antique stores that can be visited and bought from.

Places like China are available to visit and see. The program has all of these offers as well as delivering all the animals that are on board with you. This is an even greater opportunity to young men who have just come out of high school, it can open things up for them. Help them realize and be aware, that there are other people who have needs in other countries. After it's all over, you can take another trip if you wish to.

Being a sea cowboy means more than just moving animals from place to place. It helps others in need, people who have nearly nothing. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can make all the difference. That is why being part of the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good career choice.  ",0,478
"Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage

It’s time to consider the advantages of limiting car usage for the benefit of our community, our environment, and our health. The push towards a car-free lifestyle, as shown in places like Vauban, Germany and Bogotá, Colombia, offer compelling reasons to consider this shift (Rosenthal, 2009; Silky, 2002).

At the neighborhood level, reducing car usage translates to cleaner, quieter, and safer communities. Car-free or “car-reduced” communities such as Vauban, Germany offers a vision of less congested streets, where ""the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" (Rosenthal, 2009). Away from the noise and pollution of cars, citizens report feeling happier, less tense, and more connected to their neighbors (Rosenthal, 2009).

Environmentally, the decision to limit car usage can have substantial effects. Tailpipe emissions from cars contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for up to 50 percent in some US areas (Rosenthal, 2009). When Paris faced near-record pollution caused primarily by autos, it implemented a partial driving ban, significantly decreasing smog in just a few days (Duffer, 2014). This example demonstrates how reducing car usage can lead to immediate, tangible improvements in air quality.

Moreover, promoting alternative methods of transportation, as Bogotá showed in their ""Day Without Cars"", can help citizens realize the feasibility and benefits of a less car-dependent lifestyle (Silky, 2002). Public transportation, cycling, and walking not only reduce carbon emissions but also encourage healthier, more active lifestyles among citizens.

Economically, reducing car usage could catalyze a shift toward more sustainable industries. Car manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes are already transitioning to being “mobility” companies, offering a broader product range focused on alternative transportation methods (Rosenthal, 2013).

A shift away from car dependency may also bring societal attitudinal changes among younger generations, who have been shown to be less interested in owning or driving cars compared to previous generations (Rosenthal, 2013). A shift in car perception from status symbols to merely a means of transport could further reduce car usage. 

It should be noted that limiting car usage does not equate to eliminating cars. Instead, it calls for a balanced approach integrating different modes of transport to create connected networks that save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety, as proposed by Bill Ford (Rosenthal, 2013).

Finally, as David Goldberg of Transportation for America puts it aptly, ""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid” (Rosenthal, 2009). Therefore, every little step towards reducing our dependency on cars contributes to a larger, collective effort towards a more sustainable, healthier, and connected society.",1,479
" Do we ever feel surprised when people's behavior changes over time? This is because our first impressions of them can be difficult to change. While it is true that people can change, it is also true that their behavior is often influenced by their first impressions. This is why it is important to be cautious when judging people based on their initial behavior.

First impressions are not always accurate, and people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons. For example, a person may act a certain way in order to impress someone or to achieve a specific goal. This is not necessarily a reflection of their true character. Additionally, people may change their behavior due to external factors such as stress, depression, or poverty. These factors can affect a person's behavior and make it difficult for them to act in a way that is consistent with their true character.

It is also important to remember that people can change their behavior for the better or for the worse. For example, a person who was once very shy may become more outgoing and confident with time. On the other hand, a person who was once very confident may become more reserved and cautious. It is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior and to work towards making those changes.

It is important to approach people with an open mind and to be willing to see them in a new light. This means being patient and understanding when someone's behavior changes, and not jumping to conclusions about their character based on their initial impressions. Instead, we should strive to get to know people on a deeper level and to form our opinions about them based on our experiences with them over time.

In conclusion, people's behavior can change over time, and it is important to be aware of this when forming our opinions about them. While first impressions can be difficult to change, people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons, and it is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior. By approaching people with an open mind and being willing to see them in a new light, we can form more accurate and positive opinions about them.",1,480
"One big thing I want to happen is that the electoral college for voting should be changed for popular vote for the president because I think that if you change it voting would go a lot easier than it do now. Why? Because the electoral college is a more complicated voting matter that people often do and get their votes mixed up, and it takes more effort and time just to vote rather than an easy popular vote that people can measure off a chart or graph to see with person should get elected.

Another thing about the voting process I think i should'd talk about is some possible problems you can come across after this change in the voting process. There's one thing that's possible of happening is that a lot of people might nor agree with changing the voting process because they don't want to learn a new one because they are so used to the one they're already doing. Another one is that people might think things would go worse if someone mad a change because they way the votes are coming in and if you're voting on a behalf of a friend and send the vote to the wrong person and the other person lost by 1 vote when you didn't mean to send that, they should have a computer system that you use that makes sure you really want to vote on that person.

It is another major thing about voting that needs to be discussed. When all these thousands of people vote they vote should actually count not just have people vote and then the only votes that count is the people in some courtroom that have more business people come in to vote and only there's count. But I think people waist a lot of their time with the electoral college because of how it works and the way people send their votes and who the votes actually going to.

The winner of the election is the most important one because he is the main focus now because his votes were more popular of just a lot more than the other person, but that's what I want to talk about. Even though the winner won he still has to pay attention to the other candidates, but they should have a system that protects the winner files and have people haves a good watch on the people who are elected to see what their background life is like their history and what they do every day to make sure that person isn't trying no horrible plan for something.",0,481
"I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If their weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be gone to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediately would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be officially be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work, so they don't try to sneak out again. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. This curfew time is only set Fridays and Saturdays. If they come back home after 12am then there are going to be actual real more serious consequences of being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those don't work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks, so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with their parents visit, and when they are released from that place. In conclusion I believe that having a weekday and weekend curfew is good because it warns kids what there consequences will be if they disobey the law and going out after curfew hours.",0,482
"The face on Mars is 100% just a natural formation of rocks and sand/dust. Pictures show this, every time NASA does take a picture of it there are the same results. Plus if it was alien why would NASA publish the pictures. If this was proof of aliens it would put people into freak out mode.

The first thing is that giant rock formations aren't uncommon in the colonia section of Mars. In fact there are a bunch of different kinds of rocks just like the face, only that those are normal looking. They don't look like faces. The article even says that the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Even Gavin says ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'' then he keeps going to say ''That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.''

The second thing is close up images. Over the years NASA has been taking pictures of this formation. Each time they take a picture of face, the face starts to look more and more like a rock formation. NASA even publicly posted pictures on the web, and all different kinds of media to show what the formation looks like. So, NASA most of been pretty confident in what they were saying the picture was. Plus NASA is made of the top of the line professionals. They aren't made up of people who dropped out of high school. They are made up of people who have graduated from some of the most advanced and institutionalized colleges.

My third thing is if it was alien, why would NASA publicly show the pictures. In the article, it makes NASA look like they were trying to get people to get away from the alien idea. By the sound of it, I would take a guess and say if it was alien, NASA would do everything in their power to keep the images from getting out into the public. Another thing is that at one point people were saying that the picture taken on April 5, 1998, was not liable because 98 was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. So, NASA on April 8, 2001, took another photo in the year 2001 and 2001 was not a cloudy year for the Red Planet. The photo even further backed up the fact that the formation on Mars is just another giant rock, not some alien face or artifact.

So in the end why would this be an alien face or artifact. NASA has publicly proven that it is just a formation of rocks and dust/sand. Plus if NASA didn't want us to know about aliens or anything of the sort, why would they publicly announce and show pictures of the Face of Mars. That is why the Face of Mars is not related to anything alien at all and is just another formation in the colonia sector of Mars.  ",0,483
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus as the author suggested to study is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it can happen. The reason Humans should explore the Unknown Venus is because it was the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size. Venus is dangers for a human to explore but not an unmad spacecraft to go near the surface. Venus is tricky and challenging to explore because of the high temperatures that average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Even though Mercury is the closet to our sun.

On the depths of the surface of Venus there is a lot going on, as in erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. Scientists are already discussing how to visit the Venus surface which means they also want to explore and study Venus. Venus once have been like Earth-like planet in our solar system. It has some land features if rocky sediment, Valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is sometimes our nearest option for a planetary visit, given the long time frames of space travel. The Value of returning to Venus seems unlikely.

NASA is creating a blimp-like vehicle to hover 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. The almost easy task for the vehicle would use solar power because the sun would be above it all the time. Even in high altitude the climate is still pretty hot that is around 170 degree Fahrenheit. The downfall to being so high up above 30 or more miles is not much research will go on because the limited view we will get. More importantly is that scientist can't get samples of rocks, gases, and anything else since the spacecraft will be high up.

Scientist is now looking at old technology called mechanical computers. The ""old Technology"" uses gear and levers but not electronics at all. Modern computers are more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Mechanical parts are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces then a computer. What I think is that Venus is worth the pursuit despite the danger it can bring. Venus does have value to be explored because who doesn't love a challenge? I sure do love a challenge.",0,484
" Dear [State Senator],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a concerned citizen and student of political science, I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and its relevance in modern-day presidential elections. While some argue that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair method of choosing the President, I firmly believe that it remains an essential component of our democratic system.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the prevention of a tie in the electoral vote. As Bradford Plume notes in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" a tie in the Electoral College would result in the House of Representatives selecting the President, potentially leading to a catastrophic outcome (Plume, 2004). This risk is particularly concerning when considering the vast differences in population between states, as a swing in a few key votes could have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of the election. The winner-take-all system used in most states further reinforces this issue, as candidates are incentivized to focus their efforts on swing states rather than those with a smaller population.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is the ensuring of a presidential candidate with trans-regional appeal. As Poster (2013) argues, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president, as residents of other regions may feel disenfranchised. The winner-take-all system also induces candidates to focus their efforts on toss-up states, ensuring that voters in these states receive the most attention from the campaign.

Critics of the Electoral College often argue that it is unfair to voters, as some states have a disproportionate say in the outcome of the election due to",1,485
"Dear principal,

One of the main reasons why kids don't do very well in the classrooms, is because they don't get there energy out.

My brother has the same problems, he is always ready to go play outside as soon as he gets home and my mom always yells at him, and yet he still does it. He says that he is already done with his homework when he really isn't.

My friends always say that they are doing bad in school, because they don't have any sports to let all there energy out.

I play volleyball, basketball and swimming, and I still get good grades.

The more energy the kids get out of themselves the better they will do in the classrooms.

One of the main reasons why kids have sports is, so they can't be bored, I mean kids still need to have fun no matter what, but if they have a sixty or something than maybe we can punish them, but as long as we the kids have a seventy or above we still have a chance to get up and push our selves to the best that we can.

All am I saying is to give us a chance to have some fun and do our best in school you never know we could be the most talented grownups when we grow up.

I hope you read this over and over and decide that we can do it.

Sincerely Your, Student",0,486
"To be my self in this world I do not necessary need all the people that are around me. I can continue with life by my self. All the achievement that I have been doing are made by my self because, I afford without the help of people that are around me.

In this world that I know, I can not trust anybody because instead of wishing me the good things they wish me the worst. People sometimes are bad because they are telling me to do bad things, school does not help me to be someone in life, and they do not want me to be successful, but without them, I would be someone with a better future in the world.

To make an accomplishment, I do not need all people that are around me. They are not going to help me to be successful in this world. An example is I had a friend named Generic_Name she was a nice person with me, but them she started to change. Generic_Name told me to skip school with her because, school is not going to help me to be someone in life. She had a misconduct with her parents. She did not stop to do bad things, so I stop talking to her because, My parents did like her anymore. I wanted to be friend with her but, what she was doing it was not good, so I need to worried about me.

To be someone in this world I have to work hard to do what I want without others around me because, when I need something, or I get in trouble they are not going to be there with me. An example is yesterday I took a test with others students in math class, and one of them told me to help him. I did not want to help him because, the teacher can get mad at me. After we finished the test he got closed to me, and he was complaining. I told the student that he should study because, people are not going to be their when he needs to take a test.

Another reason to be successful in this world is that I would never give up, and will always do what even if the people said that I am not going to make it. An example is I am graduating this year's and my cousin told me that I am not going to graduate because I am not very smart. I do not care what she said but, the only thing that I know is that I am trying my best to graduate this year. Sometimes I want to cry because she is always saying bad things to me. In this world I don't need nobody to be someone else even my family.

After all this, I think that I do not need people around me because they are not going to be there to support me. Being with people that is around me is not good because, some of them would tell me to do bad things instead of doing good things. In this world that I am living right now people can kill me and cause me so much damage. It is better to just you in this world because you do not have to worried about someone else.",0,487
"Imagine this, you're on your way to eat out after a big game. You're having a good time listening to music with your teammates. Then out of nowhere everything goes silent. You've been hit, and the reason is because of someone texting and driving. Texting and driving should not be allowed at all. It puts people's lives at risk including the drivers and any passengers.

In recent years' studies have shown that each year, about 1,300,000 people are killed in accidents. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. If you do decide to use your phone while driving you are 23 times more likely to have a car crash.

It has gotten so bad that texting and driving has replaced drinking and driving as lead cause of death among teen drivers. The reason is that teenagers are barely starting to drive, when they decide to use their phone while behind the wheel it distracts them from the road.

However, this is not only with teens, people no matter what age cannot and should not be multitasking while driving. They need to be aware of all their surroundings.

There have been many incidents that have to do with this. For example, a teen from

Minnesota drove past a red light and killed the other driver plus his 10-year-old daughter. Also, a driver of a pickup truck collided with a church bus in Texas. This ended up with 13 people dead.

You have to make sure that people around you aren't texting and driving as well. There have been many times that people have lost their lives due to someone else's mistake. A teenager in

Anchorage, Alaska ran through a stop light, killing 27-year-old woman and mother of 2 children.

Using your phone while driving is considered illegal in 46 states not including Arizona,

Montana, Texas and Missouri. If busted, fines range from 20 to 500 dollars. It all depends on the state. Some states consider it a criminal misdemeanor which can result in jail or prison time. To avoid any accidents or any tickets there are different things you can do. You can ignore your phone for the car ride or leave it in the back seat, so you're not tempted. You can always ride with someone and ask them to check your phone for you. If you need your phone for GPS, and you're by yourself, you can always invest in a phone holder that connects to your window. This way you can see where you need to go, but you're not distracting yourself by touching it and putting all your focus on that.

Texting and driving should be banned in all states. It is not safe for the passengers in or around the car. So many accidents will happen if people decide to do it. There are so many things that a person can do to avoid any crashes or fines. Texting and driving should take place in two different times. It can put you at risk to lose everything, even your own life.

Next time you're in the car, and you get a text think twice before picking up your phone. Just think about it.

Don't do it.  ",0,488
"As citizens, we trust our country to do what is best for us. As the statement ""by the people, for the people,"" is commonly used among our government. We hope that this is true. That is why the electoral college should remain a part of how we vote, in order to keep our society fair and in favor of the people.

As it says in ""Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" it states that"" The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance."" With this being said, it allows us to know that we can trust our states to be equally represented. Just because the larger states normally get more attention, they are both represented equally. This allowing the votes to be fair and equal.

The electoral college is the reason that run-off elections are avoided. As they produce a clear winner instead of no candidate winning the majority of the votes. Run-off election cause the election to become much more complicated than it already is. Also, ""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal."" This allows election to be in favor of everyone. Though not everyone may be pleased with the person or their views, it allows the majority to be on board with one person.

When a president is chosen, it is to allow to are country to have a successful leader. Which is why we must trust that what our founding father's put in place is in our favor, and is what should remain as part of our government. The Electoral College may seem ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"" to some people, it is what keeps the election successful and fair",0,489
"The Facial Action Coding System is an invasion of privacy and should not be used in classrooms or on students. Students should choose when and to whom they reveal their emotions, and this system deprives them of that freedom.

As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. "" Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),"" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certain emotions certain people.

Every human has natural rights, and in America everyone has the right to freedom of speech. But part of that right to speech is having the choice not to speak. The Facial action Coding System would take away people's freedom of facial expression or emotion. People should have the right to chose to who and when they express their emotions, and this system takes away these rights.  ",0,490
"The end of the school year has finally come, and you can't wait to be swimming with your friends and family, however, that day will not come. Instead, you are assigned your worst fear; a dreadful, hideous, and disgusting summer assignment. When all hope is lost your teacher gives you a final decision.

""Should the assignment be teacher made or student made?""

A summer assignment is a chance for students to perfect their knowledge and make sure they don't forget what they have learned throughout the year.

A teacher-designed project is best for the students, because the purpose of the teacher is to guide their students on a path of enlightenment through the education system, students are inherently lazy and will make an easy project, and it provides the teacher a bar for which a teacher can know how advanced their students are before they come to class on the first day.

The teacher has an obligation for the county and the state, and it's to ensure that students are prepared to become adults. An educational study at Yale shows that students who go to cram school over the summer have a tendency to achieve a higher score on the SAT compared to those of a self-taught student at home. This is without a doubt, proof that a curriculum and or project assigned from a teacher is best to give a student to ensure that they retain previous knowledge and can build on it. With the teacher giving a direct projection and project on what a student needs to know also helps the student, because the student doesn't have to aimlessly ponder on what the teacher wants them to know next year. It allows students to have a narrow and direct line of sight to their goal, and enables to teacher to have a direct overview on the project.

Students are inherently lazy and result to the easy road rather than the challenging path. If a summer project was Student-designed the project, would be of the most basic and rudimentary work a student would want to finish it as fast as possible. As seen in the daily lives of Generic_School students, in which 65% take non honors or AP level courses. We can see a trend that students are not willing to challenge themselves and would not be capable to create a project, in which the project would be academically sufficient for their studies next year. Furthermore, it can be shown on a global level in which the United States is ranked within the top 15 but not top 5 based on educational levels. If we as an American culture can't rise up to be a leading power in education with the help of our teachers, how can we expect student-designed projects and studies to do any better.

A teacher-designed project will allow the teacher to know what level the students coming into the class are capable of. The Generic_School system as had tremendous amount of trouble in which teachers have to ask for multiple planning days. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that students don't know the fundamental requirements for a class when they walk into the classroom on the first day. This causes teachers to have to readjust their curriculum in order for the students to catch up to where the teacher wants them to be. A teacher-designed project would allow the teacher to tell the students the basic information they need to know before they come into the class, it also allows to students to prepare their mentality going into the school year.

The development of human society as a whole is told by its children and those who can help cultivate the young. Teacher-designed project would provide students a strong foundation for the year to come, it stops students from being lazy and wasting their talents, and helps teachers formulate a more precise teaching curriculum for their students. These examples alone show that summer projects

NEED

To be teacher-designed to insure the betterment of the young generation. Now how will you answer your teachers question will you stride to be the best you can and take on the teacher-designed project, or will you crumble under your own feet and take the easy route and design your own project risking your grades next year?",0,491

"The Electoral College is a process begun a long time ago due to the lack of educated and literate citizens in the United States, whom the government did not believe were eligible to vote for any president under any circumstances. Now that our literacy rate in the United States is now more than 80-90% (or so I believe), I don't really think that the Electoral College is useful anymore.

The Electoral College is a process describing 538 electors voted for by the state who will vote for the new president every four years. A majority vote of 270, one more than half, is required to elect the new president. The number of electors for each state equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation; meaning one for each member in the House of Representatives that represents your state, and two for your Senators. However, I think that a popular vote, or having the citizens themselves vote for the president, may be more useful.

There is an off chance that electors may vote for a candidate that their citizens did not want to choose, or the chance that two slates of electors may be sent to Congress, etc. Another prospect is the idea of a tie in the electoral vote, which would mean that there would be 269 votes for both Presidential candidates. In the event of this happening, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, in which the state delegations would choose the president. This may be fatal, however, because states like Wyoming, which only have the population of 500,000, will have as much to say about the fate of the United States as a state like California, home to 35 million people.

A lot of people usually are in favor of the Electoral College due to certainty of outcome and swing states. Swing, or toss-up states are the states that are undecided until the very end, and could very well change the entire tide of the Election. ""Voters in toss-up states,"" reads one argument, ""are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-- to really listen to the competing candidates-- knowing that they are going to decide the election."" But should we really leave such a large and important decision up to such few people? A mere 538? And even less for toss-up states?

Overall, I think that the Electoral College is outdated due to its lack of need anymore, does not fit the democratic and equal methods of the United States (for the most part), and leaves too large of a decision to too small of a group. Popular voting may just be the solution to this problem, and although popular voting may not be perfect either, it might help us figure out whom we really need for our president, rather than leaving it to just a small group.

"Many children today are faced with the decision of what they should do after school. While some opt to stay home and relax, others may benefit from participating in organized activities. Offering young people a variety of activities to explore can enrich their lives and provide invaluable skills and experiences. 

Engaging in activities after school can teach children work ethic, organizational skills, responsibility, and discipline. Through organized activities, adolescents become more independent and develop decision-making skills. They learn to manage their time and prioritize tasks and activities. In addition, participating in activities teaches kids how to work and cooperate with other people. This, in turn, leads to improved communication skills which are essential in all areas of life.

Joining activities also provides the opportunity to meet new people and form meaningful connections with peers, coaches, and adults. This type of social interaction is important for building confidence, self-esteem, resilience, and healthy relationships. Through organized activities, kids can develop their passions and explore new interests without feeling overwhelmed. 

In conclusion, participating in activities after school can bring numerous benefits to children’s lives. From gaining necessary life skills and learning to manage time to forming friendships with others and discovering passions, kids should be encouraged to engage in organized activities. It is an important part of their development and growth.",1,494
" The passage set discusses the concept of car-free cities, where car usage is restricted or banned in favor of alternative modes of transportation. This idea has gained popularity in recent years as a solution to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from cars. The passage set cites several examples of car-free cities, including Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogotá in Colombia.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of pollution, and limiting their use can help reduce the amount of pollutants released into the air. For example, in Vauban, where car ownership is allowed, but parking is restricted, 70% of families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move there. This reduction in car ownership directly contributes to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can improve air quality. In Paris, where car usage was banned for five days due to high levels of pollution, air quality improved significantly. This was particularly noticeable in areas where the smog was most concentrated, such as near the Champs-Élysées.

However, there are also potential counterarguments to limiting car usage. For example, some people may argue that it is not practical or convenient to rely on alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or biking. In Paris, for example, the ban on car usage led to congestion and longer commute times for some people. Additionally, some people may argue that limiting car usage would have a negative impact on the economy, as it could reduce demand for cars and related industries.

Despite these potential counterarguments, the evidence from the passage set suggests that limiting car usage can have significant benefits. The examples of car-free cities, such as Vauban and Bogotá, demonstrate that it is possible to create sustainable communities without relying heavily on cars. Additionally, the examples of Paris and other cities that have implemented car-free days or bans demonstrate that it is possible to reduce pollution and improve air quality by limiting car usage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several potential advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. While there may be potential counterarguments, the evidence from the passage set suggests that this approach can be effective in creating sustainable communities and reducing pollution. As such, it is worth considering as a potential solution to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from cars.",1,495
"While the mysterious formation known as the ""Face on Mars"" certainly captures people's imaginations, the evidence clearly shows that it is a product of natural geological processes rather than artificial construction. The Face is located within the Colonia region of Mars, an area containing diverse landforms sculpted solely by wind and weather over millions of years. 

One of the primary claims supporting a natural origin is the lack of detailed, identifiable features one would expect from an intentional sculpture. Upon closer examination by orbiting spacecraft with more advanced cameras, the vague eye-like indentations and other shadow patterns that give the appearance of a face from afar disappear into nondescript hills and rocks. If it were truly an enormous statue, there should be well-defined lines and contours visible even at high resolution. Instead, the formation matches the uneven, ambiguous characteristics of randomly eroded terrain.

Additionally, surrounding landforms provide context that the Face is continuous with the natural landscape. The article notes there are ""similarly configured"" hills dotted across the area without discernible shapes. Scientists also point to geological features like mesas, buttes and other unformed land masses to argue the Face was carved over eons by wind-blown dust, rather than instantly produced by design. These contextual clues indicate the area evolved gradually through environmental wear rather than instantaneous creation. 

In conclusion, while the Face on Mars superficially resembles a sculpted face from some angles, a careful analysis of the preponderance of evidence points to a natural origin consistent with the normal geological processes known to operate on Mars. Though intriguing to imagine as a sign of extraterrestrial visitation, Occam's razor suggests the most simple explanation is usually the right one - that winds and weather, not sentient hands, are responsible for shaping this now-famous Martian landform. Without clear proof of artificiality, the hypothesis that it is a natural accident of erosion remains most plausible.",1,496
"Dear Principal,

With a grade ""A"" average many students can achieve goals beyond imagination. They could eventually become a scientist, a lawyer, a successful business owner, or an engineer. As the grades get lower and lower, the possibilities dwindle down until all dreams are forfeited. A ""B"" average should be the lowest average if someone is going to be able to get the benefits of playing sports or having any extracurricular activities.

If students give up school work, and give little effort, then the ending result will not be very surprising. To be able to have benefits in life, such as sports, a person should be able to earn the right to them. Education is very important, considering it is what makes up the first twenty or so years of life. It is a fortune that many of us are lucky enough to go to school, but to disgrace that privilege by not even trying is unjust. Many people around the world don't get the right to go to school. They must be forced at a very young age to work for their family's well-being.

Sports are not the only way to get into successful jobs later on in life. Music, art, and literature are always students can get into college on scholarship. The academics in college are also required, and for the benefit of those athletically inclined, having both good academics and great sports can't hurt at all. Falling below the average ""B"" would make someone's chances at getting into college much harder, even with a great talent such at football, baseball, soccer, tennis, etc.

So, I say that by applying a rule to having a ""B"" grade average, this would only benefit the boys and girls at my school to be the most talented that they can be. In no way does this code hurt my chances nor anyone else's at achieving their dreams and goals.

Thank you for your time,

"A growing trend in day to day life that is occurring around the world is ""car-free"" day. Car-free day has spread in cities and towns around Europe and the Americas to separate suburban life from automobile use. This is beneficial in many ways to the growth, forward movement, and health of towns. So far Europe, Asia, and the Americas have given up car usage for a day, and even given up car usage entirely.

Different cities practice car-free day differently. In Paris, the near-record pollution was at its height. The city participated in car-free day by enforcing a partial driving ban and making people with even numbered license plates leave their cars at home. The following day, the odd numbered license plates were confined to home. Any person who didn't follow guidelines and conduct was fined. The congestion of smog in the capital of France decreased by sixty percent. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, like Brussels and London. By participating in the car-free day, Paris was able to contribute to cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and temporarily fix a few environmental concerns in Paris. Even though they had some effective results, Paris wasn't the only city that participated in the trend.

Across the Atlantic Ocean in Bogotá, the program allowed Colombians of Bogotá to hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. The car-free day left the normally busy, full and loud streets devoid of traffic jams. The goal to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog was enforced by minor fines. Despite the fact that rain showers were common, it did not stop the people from participating. The people of the town viewed it as a day of taking away stress and lowering AR solution. The day without cars has been part of an improvement campaign since the mid 1990s, and has since been practiced at least one day out of the year. Authorities from countries all around the world have gone to the event and were impressed and some were inspired. Even other cities that are in Colombia have joined the event like Cali and Valledupar.

Back in Europe, the city of Vauban, Germany, has taken place in a permanent car-band. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are nearly forbidden in the experimental and new district of Freiburg. While car ownership is allowed, there are only two places to park. People that live there generally like the way of life in Vauban. Many of them sold their cars just to move there in the first place. The overall feeling of living in a city free of cars seems to lift stress of the people that live there. Therefore, the people are happier and more productive. Vauban is known as the most advanced experiment in attempts to make suburbs more compact and have a minute number of vehicles. Supermarkets and stores as a result have been moved to a closer distance so that they could be walking distance away. Our development as people over the past century had been based on the car, and Vauban goes completely against the idea that progress is based off of the car.

Even in America, Obama is ambitious to change the amount of the United States solution. While although cities have yet to participate in car-free day, Citizens are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses across America each year. This gives researchers the idea that America is passed the peak driving level. American life has been integrated with cars from the time that the Model T was born. As the amount of jobs decrease, people just can not afford to buy cars. People in America have lost the general idea of a car and it's uses. Young adults in college have learned to use other ways of transport like carpooling with a friend, public transportation, or walking to the destination. The amount of people has dropped more than twenty percent and still continues to drop. This incipient stage of American life has implied the idea of alternatives to multiple motored vehicles.

Cities all around the world are deciding to practice their own car free day and are decreasing the use of cars altogether. The practice of car-free day has caused parks to initiate, sidewalks to be prepared repaired, cut traffic, give joy to the people, and overall diminish air solution.  ",0,498

"Essay:

Student evaluations of teachers have been a topic of discussion for a while now. While some people argue that it's a great way for students to have a say in their education, others believe it's not the best approach. In my opinion, students should have the right to grade their teachers. In this essay, I will argue in favor of student evaluations of teachers, providing specific reasons and examples to back up my position.

First and foremost, allowing students to evaluate their teachers gives them a sense of ownership over their education. When students are able to provide feedback on their teachers' performance, they feel more invested in their learning experience. This can lead to increased motivation and engagement in the classroom. For example, a study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that students who were involved in evaluating their teachers reported higher levels of satisfaction and engagement in their learning experience.

Another reason why student evaluations of teachers are a good idea is that they provide valuable feedback to teachers. Teachers often have a significant impact on a student's academic and personal development. By allowing students to evaluate their teachers, educators can gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn't in the classroom. This feedback can help teachers refine their teaching methods and better meet the needs of their students. For instance, a teacher may realize that their lectures are too long, and students are struggling to stay engaged. With this feedback, the teacher can adjust their approach and incorporate more interactive elements into their lessons.

Opponents of student evaluations of teachers often argue that students may not have the maturity or knowledge to provide accurate feedback. However, this is not always the case. Many high school students are mature and capable of providing thoughtful feedback. Moreover, schools can implement measures to ensure that students' evaluations are fair and accurate. For example, schools can provide guidance on what constitutes useful feedback and how to provide it constructively. Additionally, teachers can use multiple evaluation methods, such as peer evaluations and self-assessments, to get a well-rounded view of their performance.

In conclusion, student evaluations of teachers have numerous benefits for both students and teachers. They promote a sense of ownership and engagement in students and provide valuable feedback to educators. While there may be concerns about the maturity and accuracy of student evaluations, schools can implement measures to address these issues. By allowing students to grade their teachers, we can create a more collaborative and effective learning environment.

"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was originally designed to give smaller states more influence, I believe the popular vote would better reflect the will of the American people.

There are some arguments in favor of keeping the Electoral College. It can encourage candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider range of viewpoints. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates focus their efforts only in swing states that could tip the Electoral College outcome, ignoring the vast majority of states. This means that many voters feel ignored and that their votes do not truly matter. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might only campaign in urban areas with large populations. However, I believe candidates would still need to appeal to rural voters to win a nationwide popular vote. More importantly, every vote would directly impact the national outcome rather than being determined by a state's electoral votes. This respects the principle that all citizens' votes should equally influence the election.

Some argue the Founders established the Electoral College to uphold federalism and state influence. However, selecting the president by popular vote could still respect federalism while better adhering to the democratic principles of one person, one vote. Individual voters in small states would not lose influence over large states—every vote would carry equal weight. 

In conclusion, while the Electoral College system was designed with legitimacy in mind, the popular vote would strengthen that legitimacy by ensuring that every American's voice is equally represented in choosing the leader of our democratic nation. For these reasons, I believe we should adopt a national popular vote for presidential elections.",1,502
"Getting a second opinion is very common. People all the time ask for a second opinion. It can be as complicated as asking another doctor if you should follow through with a surgery or, it can be as simple as asking if you should buy something. Usually people ask for a second opinion because they know that the person they are asking has been in that situation before, and they have experience with it. And people just want to see what other people do to see if it may work for them to, if whatever they are doing isn't working. But why else do people ask for a second opinion and, how can it help anyone make a better choice? And how often do we do it? And is having more options better or worse to have?

People get second opinion's all the time. It's just a matter of why do people get a second opinion. It could be that they want to see what others would do in a certain situation or, just want help, and they know that whoever they are asking has been in the same situation before and know how to help or have a suggestion for you to try out. And most people rely on second opinion's because they rule out any other options. For example, if you are debating on buying something that you want, you look at the rating's to see if other people liked it. This counts as an opinion. Or you look at the comment's section to see if it's actually what you want and if people think it's worth it. Getting a second opinion helps in everyday life. People are away's asking for second opinion's without even realizing it. You do it all the time by asking if your hair looks good or, if they like what your wearing today. It's just a mindless thing we do. We even do it in our head we think about what people would say, and we ask them what they think. It's just something everyone does all the time because it's a self-conscious thing we all do.

To get second opinion you have to go ask someone. But without realizing it, we ask for second opinion's so often that it's just daily life. It could be as small as asking if our hair look's alright to the complicated payment's of a house. And some people have a job that they actually help make the very important decision's for us, and they are the second opinion's in our life. They are the second opinion because you went to them to ask what to do about something. It's good to get a second opinion, it's actually recommended for you to do so. It's another option for you to choose from. An example of people who are second opinion's for a job are Financial adviser's, Consular's, and Lawyer's. Financial advisers are people who help you make a decision with your money. They help you decide what's best for you to do, and they help come up with any choices, and they let you make the decision on how to follow through. Consulars are another good example on people who help make decision's for a living. Consular's help their patient's by telling them a way to deal with problem's like bullying and mental problem's. But how can it help someone make a better choice.

Asking for multiple opinion's can actually help you out a lot. It's been scientifically proven that if you have more choices you are more likely to make a better choice than if you have less option's. So getting more opinions help's you make a better choice. Like they say the more, the merrier. But other than that it's also easier to rule out ones that don't work for you and if you have a lot and a lot of them just don't work for you, you have more to pick from. This especially help's when you have a big decision to make. When you have bigger decision's to make you usually go to people that are specialized in that area. Like Financial advisers are specialized in money you would go to them if you need help on the money side. And if it's a mental problem or a bullying problem at school you would go to a school or out of school Consular to help you out. And asking for help isn't a bad thing at all. And if you really need help, and you don't go to someone your only hurting yourself if you don't go.

So having a second opinion is good to have. Its give's you more options, people who have already been their can be the most helpful, and overall having a second opinion can be more helpful than you know.

"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a great job at evaluating his idea of Venus and its dangers. No spacecraft has ever survived the landing of Venus for more than a few hours and if that is the case then surely a human could never survive that, so it seems.

The carbon dioxide, temperature and pressure is just one of the many dangers of Venus as the author clearly describes. The atmosphere, according to paragraph 3, is about 97% carbon dioxide. On the planets surface, it is also 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Just these dangerous factors of Venus make me believe humans will most likely never step a foot on the planet.

In paragraph four, the author discusses the interest in exploring this planet further despite all the dangers. Astronomers go on to believe that Venus used to be quite earthlike with lots of oceans and could have possibly supported some sort of life. It includes Rocky Mountains, valleys, and craters as well. The author states that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?""

In paragraph five the author describes to us the solutions NASA and other astronomers are trying to come up with to be able to explore planet Venus. They want to try to avoid its terrible conditions on the surface and avoid as much pressure as possible by creating a floating aircraft to hover over Venus. The author states ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" There is conflict however because there would be no way to retrieve any samples of rock or gas from this distance.

In conclusion, I believe the author did a wonderful job of supporting his idea about planet Venus. I learned a lot by reading this article and have become more interested in Venus and its conditions. The author presented a problem and gave some solutions to the problem that NASA is still continuing to work on.  ",0,504
"Today, we're going to talk about two very important operations - multiplying and dividing. We use multiplying and dividing to do calculations quickly and solve problems in the real world. 

Let's use an example to show how multiplying and dividing is faster than using adding and subtracting. Imagine that you have 10 apples and want to give them all to your friends. With adding and subtracting, you'd need to find the total of how many apples you have, and then take that total and divide it by 10 to figure out how much each friend will get. That's a lot of work!

But with multiplying and dividing, you can solve the problem much faster. You can just divide 10 by the number of friends you have -- let's say three friends here. That means you can say ""each friend will get three apples"" without doing any adding or subtracting!

So, as you can see, using multiplying and dividing can be a great way to solve problems quickly and efficiently -- so let's get to it and start learning!",1,505
"The United States has ways of being civilized, and that's by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsibility are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S. should stick with the Electoral College because it's a game changer and trustworthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article"" In Defense of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states"" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example,"" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this piece of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger than the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indefensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states"" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought Bradford disagrees with the method, Bradford still stated the obvious. In the article Plume states"" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plume disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game changer on Election Day.

Furthermore the Electoral College is just a trustworthy method to use. Also, it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states"" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is that each state has an Electoral college and those states are in different parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican Party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true, but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Poster comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates won't be getting votes all over the places. Also, the electoral college will be trust worthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a valid decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also, the electoral college represents the states votes. The reason is that electoral colleges are game changers and a trustworthy method. Certainly it all be easier to choose a president and break ties.",0,506
" Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. After thoroughly researching the topic, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College is a necessary institution for ensuring the fairness and stability of the presidential election process.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a candidate must receive broad support from various regions of the country, rather than simply relying on a popular vote victory in a few heavily populated areas. As Bradford Plume of Mother Jones notes, ""the winner-take-all system in each state means that candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" (1) This is particularly important in a country as diverse as the United States, where different regions have distinct cultural, economic, and political characteristics. By requiring a candidate to have a broad appeal, the Electoral College helps to ensure that the President is truly representative of the nation as a whole.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it provides a mechanism for resolving potential ties or disputes in the presidential election. As Judge Richard A. Poster notes in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" (2) This is because the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected through a system of checks and balances, where the winner must receive a majority of votes rather than simply a plurality. This helps to prevent the kind of constitutional crises that have occurred in the past, such as the dispute over the 2000 presidential election.

"Cars are usually in most peoples every day lives. We drive them to work, school and many other purposes. Cars have been around for over one hundred years but are people really ready to limit car usage? In a lot of cases around the whole entire world the answer is yes. There are many reasons to own an automobile, however there is a lot of reasons not to own an automobile as well.

A main topic now around the globe is the environment. Not all cars are going to kill the environment but if you put too many cars in one area it can weaken an environment, this is including cities. Cars can cause a substance called smog which is terrible for the environment or a local residence such as a city or town. As a matter of fact Paris as informed a partial driving ban to clear the smog of its city. Beijing, China is probably one of smogs the worst victims. It is known as one of the most polluted cities in the entire world! Sadly, cars are a huge part of the creation of smog. Smog is horrifically bad for the environment for a huge reason, and that reason is not being able to breathe.

Cars take up a lot of space in towns and cities across the entire globe. These areas are packed with roads, that take up many space of the area. Imaging what it would be like with no streets, turnpikes, roads in general. If you did imagine a world without roads you would see nothing but fields, trees, wildlife of every sort. If not wildlife you would see uncrowded cities with buildings that are close and not so hard to get to. People are adopting this idea around the entire world. These cities are easy and very manageable to go through. The environment is unbelievably clean in these cities and make life in general less of a castle. This may not be the way of the future, but it is a great idea!

Every car has a bad side to them. Not on the car itself but what it can do to you. Cars make a lot of people angry. How do cars make people angry you might ask? There is a thing in the car community called traffic. If you drive a car chances are you have been in traffic before. Traffic can cause anger which some people like to call road rage. Sadly a lot of people have lost their lives to road rage by getting into car accidents. Car accidents take the lives of many people in the world. A lot of things can take peoples lives, but cars cause some of the most deaths in the world. It is not true that a world without cars would be more safe, but the fact is, cars can be a very dangerous tool.

People use cars almost everywhere in this world, but the question still remains, are people ready to limit car usage? Many people have their opinions about car usage, and we may never know the answer to this question. If you think about it, we have only been driving cars for a little over one hundred years. Us humans have been living on this earth for thousands of years and have been driving cars for only a little over one hundred. Cars are being more produced now than ever, and I think will stay progressing for the future years to come. In reality most people need a car to live their lives. The way things are looking like now, chances are needing a car to live a normal life is going to progress in the following years of the future.  ",0,508
"Most people like to ask advice when they do not know something, or they are confused. A good reason to ask more than one person for advice is that the other person could be bias towards the subject you're talking about. Some peoples opinions are not great but can definitely sometimes help others peoples way of thinking can change yours. There was one time I asked for advice about school and how can I make it easier one person said just wait until high school where you can drop out that is awful advice for example. I waited for someone else to ask, and I asked my dad he said to just pay attention and try your best which helped me out with a lot because I don't do both and need to be reminded that is a good example of good advice. The reasons why people should ask more than one person for advice the person is educated to the topic, they are a good person that has made bad decisions, and someone that thinks like me.

A good reason to ask someone educated on the topic is that if I was asking I would want someone smart in what I'm asking about for a good opinion. For good opinions you ask the smartest person. The reason why is that they can help more. If someone can help more it is better for everyone. I will most likely ask the most educated person in the topic I'm looking into.

If a person makes bad choices they learn from them that's why I think asking people like that for advice is a great idea. Everyone makes a bad choice once or twice but It's good to learn form other peoples bad choices to. The people that make bad choices are usually open-minded and can tell about learning from their mistakes.

Someone that thinks like me can help me with a lot of things, but I would be more biased to them because they think like me. The bad thing is that I could be more likely to listen to the person that thinks like me because I like them more than the other people. It helps to hear something out loud from someone else than in my head. The biggest reason I would like this is because it is hard to find someone that thinks like me, and it would be nice also.

The essay talks about asking for advice and opinions. I named three type of people to ask for advice. I said someone smart and educated about the topic, they are a good person and made bad mistakes, and someone that thinks like me. Furthermore, I gave reason about all three in the paragraphs. My favorite paragraph to write was three because it was interesting to write about the topic. ",0,509
"If we think about it, this software is actually a big help for the schools and such. If we see our friend is in a bad mood then we can talk to them or find out why. I think this system can actually really help us but not only us but our teachers as well. The system digs deep into our muscles and will understand our whole face. It will indicate actions, emotions and feelings so that could help our friends if they are wondering why we are in a happy mood or a bad mood.

Our friends are really helpful at times so if our friend is feeling down or is happy about something we should have the right to know. According to Dr. Huang the software can tell us many things about a persons mood or what they are really feeling like. Knowing if a person is down or happy we can talk to them and ask what is going on, why are you sad or why are you so happy. By the computer telling us how a person is feeling will be so valuable because it shows us how big our technology is getting and by us knowing that we know there is going to something bigger than that later on in the future so now all we would do is wait for something bigger.

This software would be very helpful for our own teachers because they could take us to the computer get our face to the computer and indicate if we are bored or not. If she does this while she is teaching lesson and finds out we are confused then she can change her ways in teaching that lesson, so we can actually understand it and if the teacher knows we are in a happy mood then she knows we understand the material or at least that's why we are happy.

The Facial Acting Coding System would be a perfect thing for us so we need to get it attached to our school software. All together it would help our friends and teachers. Especially the teachers because they would know what to do to teach us better so would understand the material that they want us to learn, and the system would be a genuine thing. Not only would this help with teaching and understanding but for our friends that have depression, we would know when there emotions are hurting or when they are in a hurting place, and we could help them by this software being a thing. People with depression never show it, and we understand that, but we could at least do something about that and that is helping them and being there for them.",0,510
"Research is a crucial component of progress and development in almost every field, be it'science, technology, medicine, or social sciences. The results of research can be controversial and may not always lead to immediate practical applications, but they often contribute to our understanding of the world and guide future research. In my opinion, money spent on research is almost always a good investment, and in this essay, I will explain why I hold this view.

Firstly, research is essential for solving existing problems and for developing new solutions to emerging challenges. For example, medical research has led to the development of life-saving drugs and treatments for diseases like cancer, AIDS, and tuberculosis. It has enabled doctors and healthcare professionals to understand the biological mechanisms of diseases and to develop effective treatments. Similarly, scientific research has led to innovations in technology, such as smartphones, electric cars, and renewable energy sources, which have transformed the way we live and work. Without research, we would not have made the progress we have today, and we would not be able to address the complex challenges we face in the future.

Secondly, research leads to knowledge creation and dissemination, which is critical for the advancement of human society. The knowledge generated through research can be used to inform public policy, to educate the public, and to enhance our understanding of the world around us. For instance, social science research has contributed to our understanding of human behavior, attitudes, and beliefs, which has informed public policy and helped to address social problems such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination. Similarly, environmental research has provided us with insights into the impacts of human activities on the environment and has guided efforts to protect natural resources and biodiversity.

Thirdly, research often leads to unexpected discoveries and breakthroughs, even when the initial goals of the research are not met. For example, the discovery of penicillin, one of the most important antibiotics in the history of medicine, was the result of accidental contamination in a laboratory experiment. Similarly, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which confirmed the Big Bang Theory of the origin of the universe, was a by-product of research in radio astronomy. These serendipitous discoveries have often led to new avenues of research and unexpected benefits for society.

Finally, even when the results of research are controversial, they often contribute to public debate and discourse, which is essential for a healthy democracy. Controversial research can challenge existing assumptions and beliefs, and can lead to new perspectives and insights. For example, research on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has been controversial, with some arguing that GMOs pose risks to human health and the environment, while others argue that GMOs could be a solution to global food shortages. The debate on GMOs has led to increased public awareness of these issues and has informed public policy and regulation.

In conclusion, money spent on research is almost always a good investment, even when the results of that research are controversial. Research is essential for solving existing problems, for creating and disseminating knowledge, for unexpected discoveries and breakthroughs, and for contributing to public debate and discourse. While the benefits of research may not always be immediate or tangible, they are vital for the progress and development of human society. Therefore, investing in research is not only a wise choice but also an ethical obligation.

"For some students who are good at sports they find it difficult to keep a B average and still play that sport. Some students who are doing those sports may be in advanced classes and it's harder for them to keep a B average. We use the C average because a C is average and anything higher is above average. Possibly some of the students who are in sports don't have a lot of time out of school to do their homework when they get out of school because of sports and that's what's causing them to have a C average.

It's for hard for some students to keep above a C average because of maybe problems at home with family, and that's keeping them from staying focused at school, and they do sports or other activities to keep their mind off of the problems at home. Possibly they have been injured and was in the hospital for a week and came back and had a lot of makeup work to do, and they could get it done in time and their grade was affected by this and that person wanted to be in a drama club after school.

I am against having a grade B average because I can't always keep a grade B average in all my classes. I wanted to try out for the basketball team this year but I couldn't because I had a D+ in social studies and right after try-outs were over my grade was raised to a C.

Some of the best players on their team can only keep a C average and the school wouldn't want to cost that team the game because they changed it to a B average.

I believe that policy number 1 is the best policy as it allows students to use their cell phones during class to call their family members to pick them up. I have observed many students using their phones in class, but I think that if they are given other free times to use them, they may not use them during class periods. While it is not a bad idea to use phones during free time, it is important to remember to turn them off during class periods.

"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and with the ongoing pandemic, it has become the norm for many students. While some may argue that traditional classroom learning is better, there are several reasons why students should take advantage of online and video conferencing options for distance learning.

First and foremost, online and video conferencing options provide flexibility and convenience for students. With these options, students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially beneficial for those with busy schedules or disabilities. Additionally, students can attend classes from anywhere with an internet connection, which can be especially beneficial for those who live in rural areas or have limited access to transportation.

Another advantage of online and video conferencing options is that they allow students to stay on task. In traditional classroom settings, students can easily get distracted by their peers or the classroom environment. However, with online and video conferencing options, students are more likely to stay focused on the task at hand. This can lead to better academic performance and a more successful future.

Furthermore, online and video conferencing options can provide students with a wider range of learning opportunities. With these options, students can attend classes from top universities and institutions around the world, without the need to relocate. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have access to these opportunities in their local area.

On the other hand, not taking advantage of distance learning can have several drawbacks. First and foremost, it can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in the learning process. Without the structure of a traditional classroom setting, students may struggle to stay on task and may not be as engaged in the learning process. This can lead to poor academic performance and a less successful future.

Additionally, not taking advantage of distance learning can limit students' opportunities for growth and development. Without access to top universities and institutions around the world, students may be limited in their ability to learn from top experts in their field. This can lead to a less successful future and a lack of opportunities for advancement.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why students should take advantage of online and video conferencing options for distance learning. These options provide flexibility and convenience, allow students to stay on task, and provide access to a wider range of learning opportunities. On the other hand, not taking advantage of distance learning can have several drawbacks, including a lack of",1,514
"The ""Unmasking of the Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. Just like most natural landforms the face is quite bigger than seen on pictures. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte. The picture also shows something equivalent to a mesa. The Face seen on Mars is a natural landform because it looks similar to a butte, it looks similar to a mesa, and just like most natural landforms It's quite big.

The Face of Mars looks quite similar to a butte. First, a butte is a landform more common around the American West. In the text someone sates,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin. Second of all, the Face is more similar to a butte is because people could identify that they have seen something similar to the Face. For example, in the text someone said that it looks similar to something that they have seen before. Lastly, the Face of Mars is just a landform that looks similar to some that we have on Earth. A butte is more common on the west side of the U.S.

The Face of Mars looks similar to a mesa. First, a mesa is a landform which is more common around the American West. In the text someone states,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Second of all, the Face couldn't have been created by aliens because people right away could identify the Face as something they have sent before. Lastly, Mars's ""face"" is just a landform the looks similar to a lava dome that most people are familiar with. For example, lava domes that take the form of an isolated mesa is what the Face can be identified as.

Just like any natural landform, most of them are quite big. First, the photo of the Face captured took up most of the frame, most natural landforms are not quite hard to miss. In the text is states, As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,  he added. so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! Second of all, lad forms aren't hard to miss. For example, in the text they explain that it was hard to take a picture because of cloud coverage. Just because the clouds cover it doesn't mean that the clouds will clear, and I'm sure you could have seen it just not all of it. Lastly, When the picture was taken they said that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of the 43 meters per pixel in the picture taken in 1976. Just because the meters per pixel is smaller doesn't indicate that the landform is small. Seeing it on picture is way different from seeing it up close.

"This article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", should prove to anyone who reads it that the idea of driverless cars should not become an all out reality. The technology is simply not there and even in the future when our civilization is far more advanced, it is so easy for a mistake to be made in the manufacturing of these cars. Also, as humans, we would not cope well with having driverless cars. After years of getting used to them, they would be taken much better but in the beginning it would simply be too hard for everyone to stay focused while at the wheel. Therefore, driverless cars, while very advanced, should not be manufactured.

The technology part of this project alone is enough for anyone to object. Cars are already dangerous enough with many people getting in accidents every day. These things could already easily kill a person, without putting all of this very sensitive technology into it. To make driverless cars happen, there would have to be a ridicules amount of intricate technology worked into the car, and if one thing messes up, who's to say how much damage can be done? Putting all of our attention into our phones is one thing, but to put our lives in the hands of a machine is much more of a risk.

Even if the technology worked, it would still need some sort of human control at first. Many humans can barely pay attention to the road when they are the only ones driving let alone when they are waiting for their turn to drive. Say, a driver has a particularly hard night and happens to fall asleep in the car on his way to pick up his child. If the warnings don't wake him up, this tiredness could cost many lives. This could result in lawsuits filed against the car manufacturer and others starting to fight and protest. Even in the article it asks, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer"" (Paragraph 9)? This would be a tough situation to make laws on and a difficult thing to prove if the driver claims the technology failed. How would it be proven? People can barely handle driving now with the new technology that they have, and adding more would just make things more dangerous.

Driverless cars should not be manufactured. The technology that we have now is already making life more difficult in general, and adding to it would do less good than bad. There aren't even any claims to why it would be a beneficial thing to our society. The reason for that is that it won't be beneficial. Car manufacturers are doing it just for the sake of doing it, and it could potentially be a very dangerous thing.",0,516
"Society has long believed that conformity is the key to maintaining peace and order. However, I strongly believe that instead of encouraging conformity, society should show greater appreciation of individual differences. Conformity hinders creativity and innovation, and it creates a monotonous environment that can lead to boredom and dissatisfaction. In contrast, appreciating individual differences promotes diversity, acceptance, and growth. In this essay, I will discuss my reasons for supporting this view.

Firstly, conformity stifles creativity and innovation. When people are expected to follow a set pattern or rules, they find it difficult to think outside the box. They feel limited in their ability to explore and experiment with new ideas. In contrast, when society appreciates individual differences, it encourages people to express themselves in unique ways. This leads to the creation of new ideas, products, and services that can benefit society as a whole. For example, Apple Inc. Is known for its innovative products such as the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. These products were created by individuals who were encouraged to think differently and express their ideas in unique ways.

Secondly, conformity leads to a monotonous environment that can lead to boredom and dissatisfaction. When everyone is expected to behave in the same way, dress the same, and have the same interests, life becomes dull and unfulfilling. In contrast, appreciating individual differences creates a diverse and exciting environment. People can express themselves in various ways, and this leads to the creation of unique cultures, art, music, and cuisine. For instance, New Orleans is known for its unique cuisine, jazz music, and vibrant culture. This city's culture is a product of different individuals expressing their unique art forms and lifestyles.

Thirdly, appreciating individual differences promotes acceptance and growth. When people are allowed to express themselves in unique ways, others learn to accept them for who they are. This leads to the growth of a diverse and inclusive society that is accepting of people from different backgrounds, races, and cultures. In contrast, when society encourages conformity, it creates an environment of intolerance and discrimination. People who do not conform to the set standards are often ostracized, ridiculed, or rejected. This creates a hostile environment that stifles growth and development. For example, the civil rights movement in America was a product of individuals who expressed their unique views and beliefs. They were able to break down the barriers of discrimination and create a more inclusive society that appreciates individual differences.

In conclusion, society should show greater appreciation of individual differences instead of encouraging conformity. Conformity stifles creativity and innovation, leads to a monotonous environment that can lead to boredom and dissatisfaction, and creates an environment of intolerance and discrimination. On the other hand, appreciating individual differences promotes diversity, acceptance, and growth. It creates a vibrant and inclusive society that is accepting of people from different backgrounds, races, and cultures. It encourages people to express themselves in unique ways, leading to the creation of new ideas, products, and services that can benefit society as a whole.

"Since our beautiful country was born we've always used the Electoral College system to elect our presidents. It's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. The Electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. Clearly, the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method, & the confusion.

To begin with, the Electoral college is outdated because of the winner take all system. Even if the votes are off by one, whichever party goers the most popular votes gets all the electoral votes the United States are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. This winner takes all system also deals with population, the bigger the state the more electoral votes. This ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. Although, the winner take all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss-up states, it's still unfair to everyone.

In addition, the Electoral college is irrational because of all the confusion and trust issues. Many of the citizens in our country don't even know what an electoral college is! Plus the fact that most people think they're voting for the president, but in reality they're voting for the slate of electors. It's also possible the electors that represent your party votes for the other candidate! Another major reason the Electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even get to choose their very own electors! It's like buying a new car while being blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. Everyone's going to have skepticism, so they should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. Then again, the Electoral college avoids run off elections.

"While some students may think it's a beneficial to-do classes from home it can cause a huge distraction for students. Students could be distracted by games, or not want to accept a video conference from the teacher, and instead be distracted by YouTube, or friends. Instead, students should go to school to gain knowledge first hand instead of gaining it from a conference call from teachers or online classes. That way, students cannot be distracted by the internet and not only that but make new friends in their classroom.

Students should go to school to gain their knowledge due to the fact that gaining knowledge first hand is more efficient than talking via computer screen. Talking to a teacher face to face is much better than a one on one computer screen chat. The reason for that is during the one on one chat there could be bad connection and a student may not hear what the teacher said and could possibly miss out on some important info about the lesson they're learning. There are many benefits to going to school like learning in person. Because, if students are learning in person they can learn more about something instead of the online textbook. Working in groups is another good reason students should go to school it requires the student to be social with their group members and possibly make new friends while working on a project or classwork. After school activities are important for students because colleges look at how active students are after school. Like, joining a club or helping give back to the community with other student, this also falls into being social, this will increase the students chance to go to college just by staying after and doing some activities.

While going to school can be better than learning via online classes. Taking online classes do have some benefits like, not having to miss a single lesson due to snow, or having a one on one conference with the teacher, and having to stay home to learn the lessons. But, going to school is better because students or parents won't have to pay for the online lessons its simply free and effective. What if a student wants to take online classes but either the student can't afford it, or the student's family is in poverty no matter what students will have to go to school. The only reason school should be online is if there's a snow day. The school should provide students with laptops that way if there is a snow day teachers can post the notes on a site like Google Classroom and students can take the notes from the site.

In conclusion, Students should get off their computers and go to school for learning. Learning from a computer screen can be distracting, and students who do take online classes could be lazy and not do their work or not listen to the teacher at all. Online classes should only happen if there's a snow day for the school that way if students do miss out on classes the notes will be online. Schools should provide students with a laptop for the online classes. Students benefit from learning in a classroom because the student can be social in class and make new friends, or learn with other people, and ask for help from students if a student didn't get something.",0,519
"Driverless cars are being coming more and more common with each day that the technology is evolving. I believe that in the next 30 years we will have driverless cars all over the place.

Many car companies today are well on their way to developing driverless cars, simple autonomous cars have been tested since 2009, with many car companies rushing to learn what they can about it. The reason it wasn't happening before then was because they lacked the technology. Back then, a radar was an object on a hill that cost over 200 million dollars, not something you could put on a car and use to help it on the roadways.

Driverless cars are not a bad idea, they can improve safety because they are more precise and can respond quicker to any situation thrown at them by today's ever changing road ways and transportation infrastructure. If we can improve driver and passenger safety, why not take the chance to develop something for the future. So far, many of the tests on these cars have proven successful 90% of the time. Volvo hopes to have their first driverless car publicly available in 2020.

I believe driverless cars are going to happen somewhere in my lifetime, I won't use them because I prefer to drive myself, but I can see many using them because of their safety.",0,520
"Limiting car usage can prevent accidents and deaths by cars. Experts say passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas like the United States. If people took their bike or walked to their destination it could help people lose weight and be healthy.

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

Car-free day became a big hit in Bogotá, Colombia. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogotá in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin America city, according to Mocks, the city's mayor.

Cars should be cut down in use in many other country's especially in places like the U.S. where cars are used all the time. Experts say America's love affair with vehicles seems to be cooling. Miles driven in the U.S. peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

There are the many reasons and what places are doing to reduce the usage of cars.  ",0,521
"Dear Principal,

I feel that cleaning up the community is a good way to keep the community clean. It is a good idea to get the kids involved, but I don't feel that all the kids should have too. Some kids don't have the time and effort to do this kind of activities. For example, some kids might have to do an outside activity, like sports, and don't want to take time out of doing fun activities. Maybe they don't have enough time during the day to do even those things.

I am on a basketball team myself I don't have enough time after school to do my homework. Plus during my free time, I like to do things with my friends. If you want kids to be cleaning up the community, have the ones that volunteer. Sometimes cleaning up the community isn't such the best thing to do. A school shouldn't have to worry parents that their kids have to clean the community and be at a certain place at a certain time. Parents should let their kids pick if they want to clean the community. Parents should teach picking up after themselves, but not to clean others trash forcefully.

Some kids will want to clean a community. I say that you, as the principal, should take a vote on what to do. I'll just say that I don't have the time to clean the community, but others might, so let the kids decide. If they decide not to clean the community, then let the kids at school decide on what to do with the community and go from there. Don't take my advice, I am just an opinion. Just make sure to do what's right for the kids.",0,522

"Over the summer, many teachers assign projects that are due the first day back to school. Usually, they are teacher-designed and all students must complete them the way the teacher would like them to be completed. What if the teacher decided to allow students to create their own assignment to be turned in the first day of school? Many students would love for that to happen because then they can make the assignment as simple and easy as possible because that would mean less work for the student over the summer. Personally, the teacher-designed assignments are better than a student-designed assignment for many reasons. This will assure the student has a structure to go on that is the same for all students, this also assures that every student has the same assignment, and it would be up to them to make it their own and be creative. Also, if a student had a self-designed assignment the chances of actually getting good work are very small because no student, or teacher, wants to do work over the summer.

Assuring the student has a good structure to go on for the assignment is a strong key point in having a teacher-designed assignment. When the teacher assigns the work over the summer they obviously give each student the same assignment which means there is a structure behind the work. If a student designed their own guidelines then each student could come up with something different, but sometimes they may be too different, and it may be harder for a student to understand an assignment that way. Personally, a teacher-designed assignment is more beneficial because then the teacher gives you the criteria needed, and it is up to the student to complete the work correctly, and we can also be creative as long as we are inside the lines of what the teacher actually wants. This somewhat teaches students structure and discipline in a way because when a teacher asks for something done a certain way we, as students, are expected to do it that way, and it is kind of like a job. At a real world job if your boss gives you a work project you do it, that is the same dynamic as a student and a teacher.

With a teacher-designed assignment this makes sure all students have the same criteria, what the students do for the assignment from that point on is on them. Everyone can have the same assignment but can be as creative as they would like to be. Typically, a student would want to design their own assignment for the creativity factor of it all but little do they realize even if a teacher gives them strict guidelines there are different ways to carry out an assignment in your own way but still reaching what the teacher asks for. The point of a teacher-designed assignment is to give the students all the same thing or at least give the students all the same options on what they can do. With or without the options, the student should still be completing what the teacher asks them to. School is so much like the real world, job wise. When the boss gives their workers an assignment those workers better do it and do it right, or they won't be in very good standings. The same goes for when a teacher gives the student an assignment, either the student will do it to their best abilities or they will have to suffer with the bad grade as a punishment.

Finally, if the teacher allowed the students to create their own assignments there's no telling what kids will bring in. Nobody, not even teachers, want to work over the summer. With that being said, without a good bases for an assignment kids will easily do the most minimum amount of work possible. Which then leads to a terrible grade and little to no foundation. Being a student takes a lot of responsibility and discipline, a teacher-designed assignment teaches a lot of the responsibility and discipline simply by meaning if it's not done the student will pay for not doing it. Having a student-designed assignment doesn't always teach perfect discipline because the child can do what they want to a degree without having to really show their fullest potential.

In conclusion, a teacher designed assignment is far better than a student-designed one. The reasons above aren't even close to all the possible reasoning for my answer, the biggest reasoning is based on teaching responsibility. A student has to maintain responsibility in order to be a good student and doing a summer project correctly based on how the teacher assigned it, shows how responsible and dedicated that student is compared to others who choose not to do the assignment.  ",0,524
"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that people have about someone or something. They are often based on limited information and can be influenced by a variety of factors. However, people's first impressions of someone can change over time as they get to know the person better.

One of the main factors that can influence a change in first impressions is the person's behavior. People may initially form a negative impression of someone if they act in a way that is perceived as rude or disrespectful. However, if the person later behaves in a more positive way, this can lead to a change in the first impression. For example, if someone initially thought that a coworker was unfriendly, but later saw them being kind and helpful to others, their first impression of the coworker could change from negative to positive.

Another factor that can influence a change in first impressions is the person's appearance. People may initially form a negative impression of someone based on their appearance, such as their clothing or grooming. However, if the person later takes care of their appearance or dresses differently, this can lead to a change in the first impression. For example, if someone initially thought that a classmate looked unkempt, but later saw them taking care of their hair and wearing clean clothes, their first impression of the classmate could change from negative to positive.

People's first impressions can also be influenced by their own biases and assumptions. For example, if someone has a negative bias towards people of a certain race or gender, they may initially form a negative impression of someone based on their race or gender, even if the person has nothing to do with those factors. However, as they get to know the person better, their biases may be challenged and their first impression could change.

Having a better understanding of someone can lead to a different view than that which is initially formed. For example, if someone initially thought that a classmate was quiet and reserved, but later saw them being outgoing and funny, their first impression of the classmate could change from negative to positive. This can be especially important in situations where first impressions can have a significant impact, such as in job interviews or romantic relationships.

"Thick, foggy air is the future for this planet if we continue on this polluting path. Although, pollution is unavoidable in the industrial time we all live in. There are still ways people may help to limit the amount of pollution. With this information, the people of the earth need to limit their use of cars. For benefiting reasons such as, decreasing the deadly pollution, the lessening of stress, and economically saving.

Initial, Pollution is increasing drastically and limiting car use will help decrease it. The usual effects of pollution from a car is the exhaust it lets out. Also, the factories that manufacture these cars are letting off smoke which in result pollutes the air people breath. In source 1 paragraph 5, it explains that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some suburban countries such as the United States. Therefore, the result of cars exhaust is hurting the environment and is one of the main causes of greenhouse gases. Source 2 paragraph 15, also states the cold nights and warm nights caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Explaining the air families and children breath is basically coming to form a car's exhaust. Overall, pollution is a catastrophe and affects everyone dramatically.

Additionally, the stress of the average person can and will be lowered if the use of cars decrease. Stress can because by many things, but one of those things is the use of cars. Limiting the use of cars will really help any person relax. Source 1 paragraph 3, Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, states she has been less tense and is much happier. Father more without the use of a car this mother feels relaxed which enables her to be the mother she wants to me. Source 3 paragraph 20 explains that leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Knowing how stressful a traffic jam can be, limiting the use of a car will avoid that stress. To conclude, the street relief of limiting the use of a car will impact everyone in a very beneficial way.

Lastly, there is an economic benefit to limiting the use of a car. A car cost a lot to maintain and with all these expenses, It's hard to find money to spend on ones self. Source 4, paragraph 32 explains the car use decreasing in America was caused by recession. The cash strapped Americans had a hard time finding the money to spend on cars, which explains cars are a very expensive product. Overall, the economic impact will be beneficial to everyone because of the money saved to be used for different amenities.

To sum up, the limiting use of cars won't only help relieve stores or save money, but also help decrease pollution. Everyone would then be able to live a life knowing their children's future will be bright. Instead of full of smog and smoke.  ",0,526

"Relatively autonomous cars represent a great advance in technology, as it is observed in society today. Even though this technology represents a relatively large effective range, I am not for the use of mostly or fully autonomous technologies. Even though the use of machines and technologies for the enrichment of the human populace is important, allowing them to affect our place at the wheel will not be beneficial to the coming generations. By allowing these technologies to supersede the need for the human driver/passenger to actively think, we take away from our own capacities of understanding and adapting to the simplest of situations.

In paragraph 7, it is discussed how in 2013, BMW had developed a vehicular system called ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", which was capable of autonomously operating effectively at speeds up to 25 mph. This being said, there are sensors on the steering wheel that assure that the driver does not release the wheel. Also, when there are area-specific conditions, such as construction zones and accidents, the driver must take control when indicated. If so much input is required from the human driver, then why should we relinquish the wheel to these vehicles in the first place?

Information from various sources have indicated that when oneself is not exposed to the full extent of certain processes, it is more likely for errors to occur later. In other words, if a person is presented with a task or job largely dependent on technological assistance, and they are later given the same job, but without the 'tech support', then they are more likely to fail at the task. If we were to allow the coming generations to initially utilize these technologies in their everyday lives, as these technologies develop and progress, then they would be impaired in a situation where they would not drive a relatively autonomous vehicle.

"I think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home through distance learning. This option would be helpful for students who live far away from school, have health issues that make it hard for them to come to school, or have other responsibilities like taking care of a family member.

For example, my friend's mom has cancer, and she has to go with her to doctor's appointments. She misses a lot of school because of it, but if she could attend classes from home, she wouldn't have to miss so much school.

Another reason why distance learning would be helpful is that it would give students more flexibility. They could do their schoolwork at their own pace and take breaks when they need to. This would be especially helpful for students who have different learning styles or need more time to understand certain subjects.

Additionally, distance learning would allow students to learn from experts who are not located in their area. For instance, a student interested in a specific subject like astronomy could attend a virtual class taught by an expert astronomer who lives in another state.

However, it's important to note that distance learning also has its downsides. Students might feel isolated or disconnected from their classmates and teachers, which could affect their motivation and engagement. To address this, schools could implement virtual classrooms that allow students to interact with each other and their teachers in real-time.

In conclusion, I believe that students would benefit from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. It would provide them with more flexibility, access to experts who are not locally available, and allow them to learn in a way that suits their individual needs.",1,529

"Is Texting Worth Your Life

In the United States the number one cause of motor accidents are distracted drivers, evidently these are people who text and drive. People know this fact yet accidents due to distraction on ones cell phone still arise in today's generation. Some people think that they are an experienced enough driver to be able to get on their phones and send a text, search the web, or make a phone call. However, studies have shown that it is impossible to focus on two things at once. In the United States 1 out of every 4 car crashes are due to texting and driving.

The National Safety Council reports that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". These statistics are frightening and eye-opening to those incompetents enough to believe that they have the ability to text and drive safely. These victims are actually not experienced drivers but are mostly novice drivers. Police reports most of the accidents are caused by young adults. According to an AAA poll ""94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driver, but 35 percent admitted to doing it anyway."" Their young arrogance puts their lives at risk and states like Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, and other states outlawed texting and driving.

The risk that people of any age take when they text and drive is far too great and the laws set in place by those states are meant to protect us like any law should. People might not only hurt themselves, but they can hurt someone else who has loved ones. In conclusion, the final text to a loved one, boss, or friend should not be the last message of your life.

"It appears that the world has begun to go through a cultural shift. That is, a preference of not using a private mode of transportation to get to work, or the gym, or wherever else people need to go on a day-to-day basis. In fact this preference is very beneficial in that it has begun to affect our lives. In limiting car usage citizens can help reduce pollution such as smog in their community, or even enhance their community by introducing the need for new sidewalks or markets within a walking distance of their homes.

It is of the utmost truth, cars create pollution. In fact, they are ""one of the highest contributing factors of pollution, besides power plants in America.""(Rosenthal 34). Which of course is not very surprising since just about everybody has a car around the time that they receive their license. Cities like Paris sometimes have to ""...enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air...""(Duffer 10), this only seals in the idea that cars contribute to the amount of pollution in the air we breathe. Limiting the amount of car usage, will limit the pollution in the air. It is as simple as that. But if you limit the usage of cars it can become difficult to get to places you need to go, fear not. Limiting car usage makes it a necessity to have stores accessible to the public.

Walking or using public transportation to get to and from your local grocery or gym may be a bother, but, lately cities with a decrease in their car usage have made it more pleasant on the public. Cities like Bogotá (Colombia) are witnessing this first hand. Since their city implements a day without cars businesses and the city itself have begun to take notice in the large numbers that participate. The city is flourishing in the fact that ""parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city; eleven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced, ...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""(Silky 28). In Vauban (Germany) cars use is limited, but the suburb itself has made tasks such as shopping easier in that "", ...stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.""(Rosenthal 6). These advancements in the town are all thanks to the limiting of car usage.

All in all, limiting car usage is anything but harmful to our communities. Limiting usage helps reduce pollution in our air, and it also helps in that it aids in restoring our communities in the fact that sidewalks are being repaved or created, or even a grocery is withing walking distance. So if you have the choice whether to take your car to the market or walk, take the walk, your community might get something good out of it.  ",0,532
"If I were a part of this I would agree with you and go against you. I have some possible reasons why the school policy should change, and why not the school policy should change. The reasons the school policy should change is because some students don't do their work and some do, but in high school you do need a B average to get into sports. But other activities you don't. You can join any club you want to join in. But there are a few activities you need a B or an A average. Like the national Honors society club, computer science, etc. Reasons on why the school policy should not change is because there are so many activities across the universe. Some activities give you extra credit for a class if you're failing it. Now sports is different sports, you have passed a semester, or you will never play a sport that happens everywhere in high school and college the school policy should not change for sports, because the students who fail and don't pass the semester have to keep trying and trying until they get a B average.",0,533
"Do you think that school students should have at least participate in one or more extracurricular activity, agree or disagree?

I think that student should participate in a school activity because if you normally have noting do after school but just setting around waiting for something to happen, but if you were in any of the school sports you be won't to be bored all the time anymore. School can make you meet new friends or get even better at the sport than you are now. Sport can make you keep in good shape and good health.

Like for example there's the FFA club, the FCCLA, the confetti club this club are really fun to do. You get to make new friends too if you waned to and when you're in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school.

"Seeking multiple options could show someone a variety of things they could do. Instead of only seeing something one way, someone could be able to use many peoples opinions to form their own. People around us look at the choices we make and form opinions about us through those decisions. If we go around doing the first thing that comes to mind, people will see that, and think of us as irresponsible people.

The option that is available to someone at first may not always be the best, and it is good to take a step back to survey what multiple people say before you pursue a decision. A good analogy for this idea is someone surveying an island that they have just come across. They would need to get to a vantage point, then make a decision after seeing what they are dealing with on this new land that is unfamiliar to them. Any person who doesn't take a second to survey what they have to do is going to make a bad decision sooner or later in their life, so it is good to do so if a person wants to be successful.

Somebody giving you advice on something may not actually like you, and they might be trying to manipulate you. Fake friends could tell you to go somewhere with them because it will be fun, even if they know it's dangerous or not in your best interest. If you seek more advice from other individuals that may be looking out for your best interest then you will be able to make decisions easier. Seeking multiple people's opinions may help give you a better reputation, while keeping you safer because the decisions you make will most likely be influenced by at least one person looking out for you.

Not only is seeking advice from multiple people a good practice, but getting multiple peoples opinions on something or someone is also very helpful so that you do not judge someone or something off of one person's opinion on them. Someone's opinion on something may come from a experience with the subject, and that opinion may help you in understanding what kind of person somebody is. Or somebody could be feeding you lies about someone or something because of some sort of bias because of race, religion or anything like that.

In conclusion if you seek understanding by getting multiple peoples advice then you will be more likely to form a better decision and have better opinions about things all around you. Some people's advice is meant to hurt you and some peoples' advice is biased. Getting multiple perspectives is always good because it helps you grasp the bigger picture. ",0,535
"Dear Principal,

In the consideration of having the ability to allow phones at school or not has brought to my attention that this could be a chance to change a rule in our school.

High school students really consider their phone a main need in their everyday routine. Since they're not allowed at school many students get in trouble for sneaking around and getting caught playing with them on their free time. Teachers don't like the idea of having phones in school because they are a distraction to school work or other students. Many kids that are allowed to have there phones at school don't really focus on class work or the lesson, instead they ignore and want to hurry and get their work done, so they could play on their phones. Also, they could distract another classmate doing there work if they are playing on their phone during class.

On the other hand, phones can be useful when you're at school by contacting parents or guardians when needed, remembering assignments by setting a note or reminder on their phones, or even by contacting a teacher when absent. They can use them during free time or lunch period to talk to friends, but when the bell rings for class they have to be turned off until allowed to get them back out.

I would rather be able to have phones at school so if I got sick, or if an event was canceled, and even just to see how, so somebody is doing. With a chance of allowing phones at school could make my day easier and never forget my homework.

I would gladly appreciate you looking into a possibility of allowing phones at school.

"Technology has had a profound impact on our lives, both good and bad. On the one hand, technology has enabled us to become more connected than ever before, allowing us to communicate and collaborate with people around the world. This has revolutionized the way businesses work, helped create jobs, and given us access to information at a speed that was previously unimaginable. On the other hand, technology has also created new problems, such as cyberbullying, identity theft, and the spread of misinformation. By allowing us to access too much information too quickly, technology can also lead to feelings of information overload, alienation, and even depression.

In conclusion, while there are many positive impacts of technology on our lives, we must also be aware of its potential pitfalls. To counteract the potential negative impacts of technology, it is important to take steps to ensure that technology is used responsibly and safely. This includes monitoring the way we use technology, as well as implementing safety measures to protect our data and privacy. With these measures in place, the positive impacts of technology can hopefully be maximized while its potential harms are minimized.",1,537

Young people are also more likely to be physically active and to eat a healthy diet.

Another reason why young people may enjoy life more than older people are that they are more likely to have a positive outlook on life. A study by the University of California at San Diego found that people who are optimistic are more likely to be happy and to enjoy life more than people who are pessimistic. Young people are more likely to be optimistic than older people, because they have not had as much experience with disappointment and failure.

A third reason why young people may enjoy life more than older people are that they are more likely to have a strong social network. A study by the University of Michigan found that people who have strong social ties are more likely to be happy and to enjoy life more than people who do not have strong social ties. Young people are more likely to have strong social ties than older people, because they are more likely to be in school or in the workforce, and to have a large group of friends.

There are a number of reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people do. One reason is that young people are more likely to be in good health than older people. Another reason is that young people are more likely to have a positive outlook on life. A third reason is that young people are more likely to have a strong social network.

"Driverless cars is not a smart idea. It's a possibility that the so-called ""Smart Car"" could malfunction while someone is in it and cause a crash or even death to the passengers.

Yes, it's true that there are cars now that can break one their own, warn the driver if something is in close contact and more. However, the entire time there is a driver in control at ALL TIMES. There is not a moment where the car alone is moving. Another reason driveless cars is not a wise decision is that its illegal to even test drive one in many places. For example; California, Nevada Florida, and the District of Columbia. Close, lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.

Smart cars are not so smart. They in danger lives with unforced drivers, and are not even libel everywhere. Humans are not ready for such an advanced way of transportation quite yet. Possibly in the future, but as of right now that would be a no to smart car technology.",0,539
"Welcome to 2016. Finally, technology had gotten smarter and smarter. Even smarter than some humans these days. We have finally come up with a way to make our lives even easier. Yay! Driverless cars is a brilliant, genius idea. Having a driverless car helps better our environment, safety, and could even save you some extra money.

Pollution and global warming is a big problem. Our Earth is dying. With over population in many countries having cars that run on gas impacts our environment. All the fuel that hat is used is killing Earth day by day. Now, think about this. Having a car that runs on only half the fuel you would typically use? Sounds good right? Using only half the fuel we would typically use would make a tremendous difference in our environment in a matter of a year.

Having a vehicle is a private. It can also be very dangerous. In the news we always here about that one person or that group of teenagers getting into a car with a driver under the influence. Then we know what happens next. When you are under the influence you do not know you are, therfore, you think you are fine to do anything especially driving. Having a driverless car may actually save lives. If one is out drinking or doing things they should not be and decide they have to drive, that car might just save them from the unexpected.

Lastly, lets talk money. We all want to save money and buy more toys. Maybe you even want to go on a vacation to some nice beach where it is warm. How are you going to do that when you get a nice $1000 dollar spending ticket in a construction zone on I-65? Driverless vehicles maintain speed limit and know driving regulations. You may want to be going faster, but your car is going to save you from getting that ticket.

Better environment, protection of human safety, and money saving is something all like to hear. This new driverless car is all that within one vehicle. Purchasing a car can be difficult. You want the best for you money. Having a car that helps the environment, protects you, and saves you money is the car you should be interested in. ",0,540
"After releasing the photographs about a mesa on Mars or now known as the ""Face of Mars"", theories have come up claiming that it is in fact a face of an old extraterrestrial. This is completely false claim that has no evidence or support to be supported with. This mesa is a common natural landform that can be found commonly around. This is a mesa that happens to look like a face. Although it can look pretty convincing and deceiving, it's something common. Like mountains on Earth, it's something that triggers your brain claiming it to be something it isn't. It's like seeing a shadow pass by the corner of your eye! You claim you saw it, but it was just a fragment of your imagination. It's something our brains trigger.

As it states in the article, paragraph two and three, it states that the face the public saw was just an illusion forming eyes, a mouth, and a nose. ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short-lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This sentence supports the claim that the face was a simple fragment of the brain creating an illusion of something. It's a common landform that naturally is created. Although many theorist's claim that it had to do something with aliens and extraterrestrials, there is no evidence to support or back up that claim. Where else have you seen something out of the normal on Mars? Where there any prints or traces leading to something else? People just need to understand that it was a landform and a landform only. In paragraph three, it supports the claim that the face was a natural landform. ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation. . . Which resembles a human head. . . Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Not only did the face gain notorious fame, but the story got a lot of publicity and gained a lot more attention than it should have. All the face was an illusion that the brain of many created. Although many knew it was a natural landform, many supporting those scientists wanted the outcome of the story to take a COMPLETELY different turn! Many wanted the face to be the result of an ancient civilization on Mars, which also couldn't be possible. There were a lot of crazy theories and rumors, but the truth was the one that people denied believing in.

This story took many turns, twists, accusations, false claims, and more incredible stuff made up by the public. Although it was a simple landform, many denied that to the core, and many defended that statement with their lives. The simple truth of this whole mess, is that it was a photograph taken of a natural landform near Colonia, that was mistaken as a face with eyes, nose, and mouth by the illusions of many theorists or confused and intrigued viewers. To think the public thought a landform would be a face.  ",0,541
"If the Summer is plagued with more work we should be the ones to design it, so we can still be a creative and a hardworking student, have a strong understanding of the subject and voice out pressing matters in the world.

While us students want to be done with school and be free, it is scientifically proven that if you don't continue learning a subject you'll forget about the subject you're learning. To keep that retention, the students should create a project to keep you the students in check; It can vary from a research project to a presentation using key objectives in class to show how you used them in the real world. The position everyone should say is, yes to further have higher Graduation rates and Test scores, because if the students show compassion to their school work & their will to get things done, every one will succeed. When we work together, build each other up and help each other when needed the world becomes a lot brighter, nobody should have to be bogged down in a project that seems like it was made to have you suffer. This project should be fun and should make you want to complete it to show your classmates how well you did; It should also prove that you care for your work and backs it up.

On the flip side teachers did go to college for, four plus years and have been in this profession for even longer, so that is a great factor onto why most summer projects are teacher designed and so pressing on certain subjects. It's not supposed to be hard, the teachers just want he is best for you, and have to teach you the schematics for next year or for life. It's similar to parenting, sometimes you have to be harsh to get the point through and the point is to get that student to be well-rounded before he/she leaves high school. All the Teachers want to see is the students being successful and confident in everything they do to better on their lives. In short, they want us to succeed to better on our lives; which is selfless and much appreciated.

Another way to choose a student project would be a voting system, a select few would pitch in ideas that are teacher approved, that way we are still learning the curriculum but in a different/ active way; After that the whole class votes, yes or no. If yes it goes on to other classrooms until the verdict is reached on if the project is fundamentally helpful and play a healthy part on work ethic. This project will help students with the strengths and weaknesses, they can either group up to get it done quickly or go solo an on their own pace. Instead of laying on the couch, eating, sleeping, overall being lazy they can make that brain work as if they were still in school, I'm talking about firing all 8 cylinders and constantly learn more on a rigorous daily basis

However, teachers are no joke though as they work day and night to give us students the best education possible, it's stressful being a teacher and in our eyes a worthy sacrifice.

Grading papers form 150 students and also having to stay on track and give out more papers is a hassle; that's why we have teacher aide's to help them get through the day which is selfless and deserves recognition. To every teacher, thank you for doing what you do if we did not have you we would not be here learning.

To add on to the previous statements, we can be more inclusive and have a battle of the brains where all teachers do a project & students do a project, whoever wins by vote from the school staff will get a reward of their teams choice; these are all just ways to do school work but with a spin of fun & healthy competition, because seriously work can be boring for teachers and students alike ways we can fix this on a daily basis are:

Have a reward system regarding questions and candy.

Play a Kahoot game on the subject to engage participation.

Let students design homework or class plans.

Let them grade papers and see the process and life of a teacher.

Have students stand up and stretch.

icebreaker activities.

Talk about foreign matters.

These are just a few ways to stick out from the typical, book work and paper.

Book work has dated back decades, It's time to modernize and find different ways to learn.

While for decades teachers have been prescribing projects that are an inch thick in paper, we have been struggling, we need change now; Change is good and needed change is how we industrialized and now change will be how we do our tests, papers, essays & projects. We should be able to choose what subject a paper is on and how should it be done, because in all honesty we are the future, so we need to work on certain matters, problems & accessions towards our future like emissions, pollution & much, much more. Student designed projects will talk about these matters and open up the public eyes about how serious we, the youth of tomorrow are taking it as serious as Gun control, College Debt and other pressing matters. Allowing us students to work and talk about problems all around us would be a pleasure to spread awareness on these subjects.

To wrap this all up, We the students of tomorrow would love to be able to control summer projects in terms of spreading awareness/ looking at hard topics the public usually avoids. To be inclusive and attention grabbing is the goal, and we can push for regulations throughout the school system, a recent matter was opening high school later than usual and getting in the nitty-gritty with financial costs & Bus scheduling. We can and will build each other up on these group projects. In turn, we are equipping the mind for the real world we can use steps the gained form high school and teamwork to get the job done, test scores & graduation rates would be higher due to us engaging in school year round. To close, we can't get anything done without Teamwork and student input, we need to let students have a say in their education to let them be the best the can be in anything and everything they do.

"If people would stop using cars places wouldn't be that dirty in the air it's polluting the air, and it wouldn't be that dirty. An example would be in a German suburb people kind of stop using cars and started to walk and use bikes. People would be more healthy and active if cars didn't exist. For me, I don't like cars in general. But yeah people praise cars just because they are lazy and like using cars to get places faster. Also people waist a lot of money for a car that would last along three years. Like it says in article 1,paragraph 3 ""as a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars..."". Which means that those families do not own cars because they like to walk or use bikes.

Like in Paris they banned using cars because the air was so polluted and dirty not even breathable for people. So they fined people that had their cars outside. So basically what they made people do is walk and use bikes. In article 2, paragraph 1 its says ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". What the author is saying is that people were using cars too much and the smoke would pollute the air. They almost held the record for the most polluted air, so they partially banned using cars.

In conclusion, Paris was making a good decision to ban cars or if not you'll get banned.",0,543
"Code]

Dear [State Senator’s Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or replaced by a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from various perspectives, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for five key reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Poster highlights, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputed outcomes are less likely under this system compared to a direct popular vote. In an era with highly polarized politics, maintaining a system that ensures a definitive winner is crucial in avoiding extended election crises.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents all regions of the country. With each region having a different set of interests and concerns, it is important for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas and neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By requiring candidates to gain support from multiple regions, the Electoral College system helps preserve a sense of inclusiveness in the election process.

Thirdly, the Electoral College promotes the importance of swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates are incentivized to campaign heavily in states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates, leading to more thoughtful decision-making. Ensuring that the swing states decide the election helps maximize voter engagement and enhances the overall quality of democratic decision-making.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores political balance by giving some weight to large states. Although the Senate already provides a system of representation that balances the power between larger and smaller states, the Electoral College further reinforces this balance. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states naturally receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, thereby ensuring that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the Electoral College automatically produces a clear winner. This prevents the need for complex and time-consuming run-off elections, which would only complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College simplifies the process and ensures that a single candidate emerges as the legitimate winner.

While I understand the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the idea that it is more democratic and prevents the disenfranchisement of voters in states with no chance of winning, I believe that the current Electoral College system balances these concerns effectively.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved due to the certainty of outcome it provides, its ability to ensure that the President represents all regions of the country, the importance it places on swing states, the balance it restores to large states, and its ability to avoid run-off elections. These practical reasons outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system and demonstrate the strengths of the Electoral College in our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the pros and cons of both systems in making your decision.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,544
"I'm not for driverless cars because they can still cause an accident and if any person could, Also there not really driving the car itself but is helping out the driver by stop when they are not looking or if there is a green light then, the car will alert the driver to press the gas if they are distracted. But, it will not drive a person home if they are drunk. There are better ideas than making a driving car. But, instead of building driverless cars we can save the environment. They can make the world a better place but make fuel efficiency cars instead of driverless cars. Make trucks not run on diesel we can be doing so much more than making a driverless car. What if the car computer programming chip is damage then that means that the car can't be able to work correctly and that the car is in a higher risk of getting more people in danger because of the driverless scar.

"Have you ever thought about finishing high school early? Not every student wants to finish school in four years. The reasons high school students would want to do this is to reach their career early, or they have personal matters that make them want to leave early. To some teens going through with the program could be a difficult task. It is a good idea for teens to take the three-year program, because they are trying to accomplish their goals early.

Not all teens want to spend all four years of high school. Their reason could want to move on to college after those three years. Another reason to why students want to finish is because they could have problems at their school. High school has bullying and other issues that could leave them with no choice but to want to take the three-year program. There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age.

The three-year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but it's not an easy thing to do. Students would have to take extra classes, which means more work. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and English classes. For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes. For high school teens who do this program would have no time to slack off and would have to work had achieved their goal of finishing in three year.

In the three-year program you are given choices on how you would like to do your work. There are schools that could let you take the program through online. Students could also have the choice of taking the work over the summer right after school goes on break. High schools that have this program are giving students a huge benefit. It is a good idea for teen s that are taking a three-year program to advance quicker to their future goals.",0,546
"I think driveless cars are a positive thing today. Driverless cars are helping our future and making things a lot better for us now. Technology is being put to great use now with driveless cars.

The reason I think driveless cars are a positive thing is because they are helping save lives. The driveless cars are helping save lives every day. The more technology we have, the better the cars become. They have alerts and different things to make sure the driver knows what is going on and help to try to avoid accidents from happening. For example BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant.""

Driverless cars Can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. These are great things to have on a car to makes things a lot easier and safer for others and yourself.

The driveless cars are just an enhancement for humans and to help keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safer now.",0,547
"Is it a good idea to force students to participate in an extracurricular activity? I do not believe so. There are many reasons why not to force after school activities. It is not necessary to force students into taking an extracurricular activity because: the student could already be participating in a non-school related activity, the student's family might not be able to afford the activity, and the student might be unable to handle the extra work.

A lot of students actively participate in activities after they leave school, that are mostly run by the school they attend. However, some activities are run by separate organizations. An example is the Y.M.C.A. They have swum teams for both adults and children to take part in and enjoy. If every student had to do some sort of school regulated extracurricular activity, then practices, or competitions could be scheduled at the same time. That would most likely cause those students to drop out of an activity they had enjoyed, to attend a school activity that is mandatory.

School activities are not always free. Sadly many families cannot afford more than what they use to survive. Unless the school pays for all the expenses, the student's family could have a hard time getting what is needed for that activity. If the student were to serve on the student council, money may be needed to start fundraisers, or give extra supplies for an event they set up. With most sports, the gear has to be bought in order for the student to play. To try out a current physical is needed, and that costs money that the family might not have to spare. Then if the student did not make the team the money was wasted. If the gas money to transport the student was unavailable, then they could not go.

Making kids participate in extracurricular activities could make them more active, but the student could have enough work to handle as it is. There are very many students around the globe who are very stressed about school. Adding activities that they have to prepare for and worry about could just add to their torment. A hardworking honor student that gets three packets of homework every night, will not have time to practice for volleyball, or prepare a speech for their school's student council. Perhaps there is a student who does their best but is not excelled at learning. To understand and pass his classes he might have to take extra time on homework. Maybe he has a tutor that he goes to after school to help him with difficult subjects. That student would not have much time to do anything but work if he had three hours of baseball practice when he got home.

In conclusion, schools should not force students to participate in an after school activity. It would cause more damage than good. Schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because: many students are already in non-school based activities, the family of a student might not be able to afford the activity, and students are overwhelmed with work as it is.",0,548
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend class from home?

Some schools offer distance learning as on option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is one option for all students to finish everything classes because you need to better future.

It is important for all students being able to finish the classes. For example, They want to take many class from home or nine. Also, many students want to finish all classes because it is necessary for your future. Although for some students is necessary to take classes by your home online because necessary to finish all classes. In summary this is one opportunity for all students to finish the classes for to graduate the schools.

I think is very important for all students to finish classes because if you want to go to college you need to finish everything classes. For example, Some students want to go college. Also, they want to finish everything classes. However, Others students want to brace for your future because they have many dream in your life.

In conclusion everything students is necessary to finish all classes because if you want to better future in your life you need to brace.

While some people believe that is one option for all students to finish everything classes because you need to better future, Others argue that some students think to take classes online is boring dull and stressful for them.

Because no all students want to take classes online. Although this might be valid there are several important ideas to considered, such as Some students is disagree with to attend classes from by way of online. For example,They don't have time because some students is working. Also, many students only want to stay in your home and not do make anything in your life for one better future. Meanwhile, some students is stressful with to take classes online or video conferencing. In conclusion the students is disagreement for to finish the classes online or in your home.

Some school is offers a many students to finish all class. You can to finish the classes in have better future for you in your family. If all students to finish the classes you can to graduate at your go to the college.

"This year my principal has decided that all students at my school have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities could be to work on the student council, help on the yearbook, participate in sports, and many other activities. Some students strongly disagree with his decision because they would rather go home and sleep or be alone. While other students are very excited about his decision. Would you be happy if you had to participate in at least one after school activity? I am very excited with his decision because I feel like this will help kids get into better shape, be able to hang out and meet new friends, do better in school, and help not put as much stress on their parents.

Even though you may not realize it, but participating in these activities help you be able to get into better shape. It helps the kids that don't do anything on their own start moving more, if they decide to do a sport. Participating in these activities also help you get into better shape because you will probably push yourself to be better than the rest of the students there. A couple of years ago a student was overweight, but she started to participate in these activities, and she is now in very impressive shape and a lot of people are jealous of her. Even if you don't do a sport you can get in better shape because you are doing more than what your body is used to.

Having to participate in at least one extracurricular activity would give you the opportunity to meet new people and to see some people you rarely get to see. While you are participating in the activity, it would be very easy to make new friends. You would be able to bond very quickly because you most likely have the same interests, considering you both are participating in the same activity. Maybe your best friend moved to a new school, and you only get to see her when you go to your activity. I personally think that activities are more enjoyable when you are able to work with or compete against someone that you know or met.

Studies have proven that kids that participate in extracurricular activities do better in school. While the kids that just go home and play video games or sleep do not do as well in school. Last year, a student that would go home every day and just lay on bed texting people until midnight got very bad grades and the almost had to repeat seventh grade. Until, he joined a basketball club and all of his grades gracefully shot up. All of a sudden, he was one of the smarter kids in his grade. The extracurricular activities help you with school because they not only take some stress off of school; but they also help you find people that you can help each other in school, and they make you be able to sleep which refreshes your brain, so you can think better in school.

Not only will the principal and students benefiting from this, but the parents will also. They won't have to deal with all the kids problems as much at home because the kids won't have it on their minds will be taken off of it by the distraction of other things by the time they get home. Parents and kids probably won't have as many arguments like they normally do. They also will have somewhere for the kids to go, so the parents can get more things done. The parents will also enjoy their kids having better grades. They would also not have to help as much on school work because their kid would probably understand what they are doing in class better. So this decision will work to everyone's benefits.

Although not everyone is happy with the principals decision, he did the right thing. By participating in extracurricular activities it helps benefit everyone. It helps the students get into better shape, be able to meet and hangout with friends, do better in school, and not put as much stress on their parents. When people realize the benefits they will be very happy that he made this decision as well. The students will be amazed about how the activities turn out, and they will probably be much happier students. Overall, the principal made the right decision even though people are fighting against it.  ",0,550
"Sure thing! Here's my essay on the benefits of accomplishing goals by always doing something:

Accomplishing goals is super important. Like, really important. But did you know that doing something every day can actually help you accomplish those goals? Yeah, it's true!

First, doing something every day helps you build habits. And habits are like, super powerful. Once you start doing something every day, it becomes a part of you. It's like, your brain starts to expect it and stuff. And that means you're way more likely to stick to your goals.

For example, let's say you want to learn how to play the guitar. If you just practice whenever you feel like it, you might not make much progress. But if you practice every day, even if it's just for a little, you'll be way better at it in no time. See what I mean?

Another thing that happens when you do something every day is that you get into a routine. And routines are like, super helpful for achieving your goals. When you're in a routine, you know exactly what you need to do every day to make progress towards your goals. It's like, your brain has a plan, you know?

And let's not forget about motivation. When you do something every day, you get motivated to keep going. Like, you start to feel like you can actually do it, you know? You start to feel like you're making progress, and that's super motivating.

Finally, doing something every day can help you stay focused. When you're focused on something, you're way more likely to achieve your goals. And when you're doing something every day, you're constantly reminding yourself of what you want to achieve. It's like, your brain is always on the same page, you know?

So there you have it! Doing something every day can help you accomplish your goals in so many ways. It's like, the ultimate way to get stuff done. So make sure you're doing something every day, even if it's just for a little. Your goals will thank you!",1,551
" Benefits of an Additional Hour of School

It is widely believed that students who study more have a higher chance of passing tests. However, some students may benefit from an additional hour of school, as it could help them learn more and improve their academic performance. Additionally, some students struggle with certain subjects, and an extra hour of school could provide them with the additional support they need to succeed. Therefore, schools should consider adding an extra hour to their schedules to provide students with more education, better job opportunities, and better preparation for exams.

Firstly, students with more education are more likely to succeed in their academic and professional lives. Education is essential for many daily activities, and it is a lifelong investment. Students who have a good education have a better chance of getting into a good college, finding a high-paying job, and achieving their career goals. Additionally, education can help students develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication, which are essential for success in many fields.

Secondly, an additional hour of school could provide students with better job opportunities. Some students may not be satisfied with the jobs they have, and an extra hour of school could give them the skills and knowledge they need to pursue their dream careers. Additionally, students with a good education are more likely to be offered higher-paying jobs, which can improve their financial stability and security.

Thirdly, an extra hour of school could help students prepare better for exams. Some students struggle with exams because they do not have enough time to study or review their material. An extra hour of school could provide them with the additional time they need to learn more and be better prepared for exams. Additionally, passing exams is crucial for maintaining good grades, which can impact a student's academic and professional opportunities.

In conclusion, an additional hour of school could provide numerous benefits to students. It could help them learn more, improve their academic performance, and prepare better for exams. Additionally, it could provide them with better job opportunities and financial stability. Therefore, schools should consider adding an extra hour to their schedules to provide students with more education and support.",1,552
"The author supports this idea because he brings it up more than once. For instance in the beginning of the passage the author mentions that the spacecraft has used cameras and other robots. The sad part is they didn't survive more than a few hours.""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours.""

The author gives details on certain things that we should be aware of. He doesn't just release it with one fact and stay with that. He tells the people about stuff we already know about or things that aren't healthy for humans. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venue's atmosphere. On the plansureface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" As humans we know what now our bodies will react to temperatures like that. The author isn't sugarcoating anything for humans.

My conclusion to this is that the author he is telling the truth despite the dangers like possibly dying before coming within two feet of the atmosphere that Venus is a worthy pursuit the only problem is how can we pursuit it if we have nothing that can make it past it. What the author does here is really let us know the dangers then explain why it's like that. That really helps because if I didn't have that I'd be confused out of my mind.",0,553
" Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the current system for electing the President of the United States. While I understand the arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, I believe the Electoral College provides several key benefits that make it a more effective and fair way to elect the President.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts. Under a popular vote system, a candidate could win the presidency by winning a narrow margin of votes in a few swing states, while losing the election overall. This would mean that millions of voters would have their voices ignored, as their vote would not have affected the outcome of the election. In contrast, the Electoral College provides a more balanced system in which every state's electoral votes are given equal weight, regardless of the size of the state's population. This ensures that every vote is counted and that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few key swing states.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationally, rather than just focusing on a few key states. When candidates know that they need to win over voters in every state, they are incentivized to work hard and appeal to voters across the country. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few key regions or interest groups. In contrast, under a popular vote system, candidates may be incentivized to focus solely on a few key swing states, ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other parts of the country.

Third, the Electoral College provides a mechanism for checking the power of large, urban states. In a popular vote system, states with large population centers would have a disproportionate amount of influence over the election, as their votes would be given more weight than those of smaller, rural states. This could lead to a situation where the President is elected by a few large, urban states, while ignoring the needs and concerns of the rest of the country. In contrast, the Electoral College provides a mechanism for checking the power of large, urban states by giving each state's electoral votes equal weight, regardless of the size of the state's population.

Finally, the Electoral College provides a mechanism for resolving ties in the election. In a popular vote system, a tie would require a runoff election, which could be chaotic and uncertain. In contrast, the Electoral College provides a mechanism for resolving ties by having the House of Representatives choose the President, with each state delegation having one vote. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few key interest groups or regions.

In conclusion, while there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system for electing the President, I believe the Elector",1,554

"In 1976 there was a mysterious face found on the planet Mars. I'm a scientist at NASA space station discussing some accusations about this face. Some people are beginning to believe that the face was created by aliens. However, that is not the case here. This mysterious face was simply created by natural causes and happens to just have distinct features of a human face.

My first reason as to why this face is a natural landform is because there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed on Mars, or anywhere else. If there is no proof of these aliens living then how could they have possibly been able to create such an artifact. Plus, believing that this was caused by natural causes is way more believable than relying on unproven research that aliens once existed.

My second reason to this being just a natural landform is scientists believe the nose, eyes, and mouth of the figure are created by shadows giving it an illusion of a human face. This attracted the public which is exactly what NASA wants. So, NASA is using the illusion of this human face to attract more attention to their program and Mars itself. By doing this it is making most people believe the face was created by aliens, which it in fact wasn't. Evidence of this is when the article, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

My third and final reason this mysterious face is just a natural landform is that is resembles features of landforms common in American West. For example, Gavin states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" Gavin also says. If this face resembles American Western landforms so much then it must be a natural landform itself.

Although there are reasons this face wasn't created by aliens there are some conspiracies involving NASA. One is that people believe NASA has already found traces of life on Mars and would rather keep that seat from the public. This is believable because NASA wouldn't want to alarm the public of extraterrestrial lifeforms and create panic. Although it could create panic, NASA should want to inform the public because it could cause support of NASA and their findings instead. For example, people could start donating money to the company to help with further research and have more knowledge about what they do.

This mysterious face on the surface of Mars is no more than a natural landform. It was not caused by aliens because there is no scientific proof. NASA wants the public to believe it is a cause by aliens, so they could get more publicity for it. I mean, this face has already starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. It's had enough publicity and does not deserve any more because it is just a natural landform caused by natural changes, not aliens.  ",0,557
"Driverless cars sound like everybody's fantasy, you see and hear about them from everywhere; fictional movies, children's books, television, but having a driverless car might not be the fantasy you hoped for. There are many problems that come with the driverless cars. While you may be able to get around easily, who would be at fault if technology fails and someone is injured-The driver, or the manufacturer? Surely If you were to be in an accident because the car itself malfunctions causing injuries to you and other people you wouldn't be to blame?

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert human drivers. In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. Why? Because it is rather dangerous. Another negative aspect would be that not everybody would agree with driverless cars, so would this cause a problem? Having normal cars and driverless cars on the streets together?

Having a driverless car will cause issues with navigating through roadwork or accidents, because they might be programmed for certain roads with certain conditions. So if something were to happen such as an accident would the car know when to stop? Or if there was an ambulance coming down the road for an emergency, would the car know to pull over and let it pass?

Another con to the driverless cars would be that there would be so many sensors to go along with it. These types of cars need to have sensors in every direction, because there are unexpected animals, or children that cross the road without paying attention, they need to make sure the sensors are able to detect those types of things fast.

Technology is going very far but not this far yet, we might be trying to rush it too much, having only driverless cars would pretty much mean getting rid of normal cars, therefore; Many car businesses go out of work and many people lose their jobs. That being said, it would be way too expensive to replace normal cars with driverless cars for the billions of people in the world. While there are many benefits to this idea of driverless cars there are just as many if not more cons.",0,558
" Limiting car usage has numerous benefits for individuals, society, and the environment. While some may argue that reducing car usage will negatively impact daily life and the economy, the evidence suggests otherwise.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, emitting harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year. By reducing car usage, we can significantly reduce air pollution, improving public health and quality of life.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is reduced traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a significant problem in many cities, causing frustration and wasted time for commuters. According to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average American spends 42 hours per year stuck in traffic, which costs the economy $124 billion in lost productivity. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, and walking, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of our transportation systems.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are a significant contributor to climate change. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 15% of global emissions. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce our reliance on cars and lower greenhouse gas emissions, helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Some may argue that limiting car usage will negatively impact the economy, particularly in areas where car manufacturing and sales are significant industries. However, the evidence suggests that promoting alternative modes of transportation can actually stimulate economic growth.

Dear TEACHER_NAME

It has come to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I personally am happy, because my cell phone is a big part in my life. I use it all the time and so do my parents. It's very convenient to have during the school year. Most of the cell phones today have internet access. Including my phone. That is something very useful to have even for school. I even see some teachers have their cell phone on one day, because they are expecting a very important phone call.

One of the policies I see you are considering is to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. I think this is the better choice, because if you ever forgot a homework assignment or gym clothes or something important you can ask your parent to drop it off.

Some teachers disagree with this because they say why don't the students just use the office phone? Well if you ever considered what students use the phone, you wouldn't want to use it ever again. A lot of students who call to home are sick. I doubt that the secretaries at the office constantly disinfect the phone.

Also, if your parent does drop off something and the secretary announces it over the loudspeaker, it disrupts the class. If you had your cell phone, you and your teacher would be the only ones who know about it. Not the entire class.

I do think that is the better choice and a lot of students will agree as well, but I do see some problems with it. I could predict that because we could use the cell phones during free periods and lunch, most of the students would forget to turn them off. Therefore, a there could be more disruptions.

Usually a couple of times a year at least one student's phone goes off during class. I think that this would happen more often because we would be allowed to use them. I think that the policy at school we have now is just fine. We are allowed to have them in school, just put away in the lockers.

I have to admit that when I'm doing my homework and my phone is right next to me, I easily get distracted. I'm sure that a lot of other students would agree that they too get distracted.

Furthermore, I understand that I have to pick one policy and I still think that policy number one is better, but there are problems to it. If I were you TEACHER_NAME, I would just keep the cell phone policy how it is today, or revise policy number one. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system or, alternatively, to explore the possibility of transitioning to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the viewpoints presented in multiple texts, I believe that both systems have their merits, and it is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each.

The current Electoral College system, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register (""What Is the Electoral College?""), provides a fair and reliable method for electing the President. Firstly, it ensures certainty of outcome by requiring the winning candidate to obtain a majority of electoral votes. This means that the elected President must have broad support from across the country, rather than relying solely on a popular vote plurality. Furthermore, the winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electors promotes the idea of ""everyone's President,"" as individuals from various regions have a say in the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Poster (""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""). By focusing their efforts in these states, candidates are compelled to address issues that may otherwise go overlooked. This ensures that a wider range of concerns are taken into account during the campaign and potentially in the governance of the country.

The Electoral College also protects the interests of smaller states, as mentioned by Judge Poster. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states can have their political weight balanced by the Electoral College. This allows candidates to give attention to the needs and concerns of citizens in these states, preventing the dominance of a few populous states over the others.

On the other hand, the argument put forth by Bradford Plume (""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"") emphasizes the need for change. Plume contends that the electoral college is unfair to voters, as candidates often prioritize swing states and neglect others. This leads to an imbalance of attention, where only a few states have a significant role in shaping the outcome of the election. However, it is important to recognize that this issue can be addressed by reforming the current system, such as implementing a proportional representation method like that practiced in Maine and Nebraska.

While some critics of the Electoral College, like Plume and the Gallup poll respondents cited in his text, argue for its abolition in favor of a popular vote, we must consider the potential risks and complications involved. As Judge Poster points out, a direct popular vote could lead to a run-off election if no candidate receives a majority, which would significantly complicate the election process. Moreover, a popular vote system would require careful consideration to ensure that the voices and interests of smaller states are adequately represented and balanced against those of more populous states.

In conclusion, it is essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College and a direct popular vote system. While the Electoral College has its flaws, it provides a level of certainty, encourages a trans-regional appeal in candidates, promotes attention to swing states, allows for balanced representation of smaller states, and avoids run-off elections. However, reforms should be considered to address its shortcomings, such as implementing a proportional representation method and ensuring the needs of all citizens are taken into account.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our state and the nation as a whole.

"As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can provide a sample essay on the given topic based on factual information and reasonable arguments.

In recent years, the debate on the role of parents and communities in local schools has become a hot topic in education. Some people argue that education is too important to be left solely to professional educators, while others believe that schools should be managed by experts without interference from outside. In my opinion, involving both parents and communities in local schools is crucial for enhancing the quality of education and building a strong sense of community. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support this viewpoint.

First, parental involvement in schools has been proven to have a significant impact on students' academic achievement and social development. Research shows that students whose parents are actively involved in their education tend to have higher grades, better attendance, and fewer behavioral problems than those whose parents are not involved. When parents participate in school activities, such as volunteering, attending parent-teacher conferences, or joining parent-teacher associations, they demonstrate to their children that education is important and valuable. Moreover, parental involvement helps to create a positive school culture and fosters a sense of community among parents, teachers, and students.

Secondly, community involvement in schools can provide additional resources and support to enhance the quality of education. Communities can contribute in various ways, such as sponsoring school events, providing mentorship or internship opportunities, or donating supplies and equipment. For example, a local business may donate computers to a school, which allows students to practice their computer skills and access online resources. Likewise, community members with expertise in certain areas can serve as guest speakers or mentors, providing students with real-world knowledge and experience. Moreover, community involvement can help schools to address social issues and promote cultural diversity, as community members can provide insights and perspectives that may not be available within the school.

Finally, involving both parents and communities in local schools can lead to better decision-making and accountability. When parents and community members have a say in school policies and programs, they are more likely to support them and hold school administrators and teachers accountable for their performance. For instance, if a school is facing a problem such as bullying or low academic achievement, parents and community members can work together with school officials to find solutions and implement effective strategies. Additionally, involving parents and communities in school governance can promote transparency and trust, as they can provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve the school's performance.

In conclusion, involving both parents and communities in local schools is essential for improving student outcomes, enhancing the quality of education, and building a sense of community. By working together, parents, educators, and community members can provide a supportive and enriching environment for students to learn and grow. While professional educators play a crucial role in teaching and managing schools, they should not be left alone to handle all the challenges and issues that schools face today. Only through collaboration and engagement can we ensure that every student has the opportunity to reach their full potential and succeed in life.

"I believe that the use of animals in scientific research is unethical and unjustifiable. Animals, just like humans, have the right to live their lives without being subjected to pain and suffering, and using them for our own benefits is not only wrong but also inhumane.

First, it is morally wrong to use animals for scientific experiments because they cannot give their consent. Animals do not have a voice to express their opinion on whether they want to participate in such experiments or not. Therefore, it is unethical to force them into situations that may harm or even kill them.

Moreover, animals are often subjected to excruciating pain and suffering during scientific research. For instance, in cosmetic and pharmaceutical testing, animals are often subjected to skin irritation, blindness, and even death. Such cruelty should not be allowed in any form of research, as it is morally wrong to inflict pain and suffering on innocent creatures.

In addition to these reasons, it is also worth noting that animals are not always accurate models for human conditions. Many times, results from animal testing do not translate to humans, which makes it an unreliable method of conducting research. For instance, a recent study showed that 90% of drugs that were proven to be effective in animal testing failed in human clinical trials. This indicates that animal testing is not an accurate measure of how drugs will work on humans.

Therefore, I strongly believe that the use of animals in scientific research should be abolished. There are many alternative methods, such as computer modeling and in vitro testing, that can be used to conduct research without harming animals. These alternatives are not only humane but also more accurate and cost-effective.

In conclusion, we should all advocate for the end of animal testing in scientific research. It's time for us to take action and protect the rights of animals, who cannot speak for themselves. We must remember that our actions have consequences, and using animals for our own benefits is not justified.",1,565
"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. On the one hand, there are strong arguments in favor of making community service mandatory. Helping those in need is an important value that we should encourage in our student body. By volunteering our time to tutor younger students or improve our local neighborhoods, we demonstrate compassion and strengthen the bonds within our own community. However, requiring community service risks overburdening students who already have demanding academic and extracurricular obligations. 

While I believe that volunteering is highly valuable, it should remain a choice. Forcing involvement risks having the opposite of the intended effect - it may foster resentment rather than goodwill. Not all students have spare time available due to jobs, family responsibilities or intensive course loads. Moreover, the desire to help others is best nurtured through informal role models and leading by example, not rigid rules. A mandatory program could undermine the inherent value of voluntary service by making it obligatory. Instead of feeling they are contributing, students may feel they are simply fulfilling another hoop to jump through.

A better approach, in my view, would be to strongly encourage community service through promotion of the opportunities available, recognition of student volunteers, and sharing stories of the positive impact students can make. Leading by our own volunteer actions as a school community is more meaningful than imposing a mandate. Students who have the ability and interest to volunteer their time should feel empowered but not obliged to do so. Striking the right balance respects both the value of volunteerism and students' other priorities and freedom of choice. 

In conclusion, while I support the cause of community service, I do not believe making it compulsory for all students is the wisest path forward. A policy of promoting and encouraging voluntary service through moral leadership would be more effective at cultivating goodwill than one of enforcement. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,566
"Hi there! I'm just a grade 9 student, but I can definitely help you understand why seeking multiple opinions can be super helpful when it comes to making a tough choice.

Let's say you're trying to decide which extracurricular activity to join. You might ask your friends, family members, and even a teacher or mentor for their opinions. Each person you ask will have their own unique perspective and experiences, which can provide you with a more well-rounded view of your options.

For example, your friends might have first-hand experience with certain activities and can tell you what they enjoyed or didn't like about them. Your family members might have a different perspective, like how much time an activity takes up or how it might affect your academic performance. A teacher or mentor might have experience working with students who have participated in these activities and can offer valuable insights into what might be the best fit for you.

By talking to multiple people, you can get a better understanding of the pros and cons of each activity and make a more informed decision. You might also learn about factors that you hadn't even considered before, like how an activity might impact your college applications or future career goals.

Overall, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice by giving you a broader and more diverse range of perspectives. It's like getting a puzzle piece from multiple people and putting them all together to see the bigger picture. It might take a little more time and effort, but it's definitely worth it in the end!",1,567
"I'm going to start explaining and giving my opinion, Technology is one of the main reasons, why the world is changing and accommodating with the necessities that the person have, for example: we live in a community that if everything is easier is better, few years ago people had to walk hours or days to go somewhere, on this day's the transport is a lot easier because the technology had increased,

you can use or have your own car or you,

can take the public transport and go everywhere without problems and if you want to go to another country you can! Because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like.

So technology have a positive effect because it is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why I think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, without saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; nobody have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions.

Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for having that note, but all that had changed too,

When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happened;

years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is having be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different. Technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.",0,568
" The idea of finishing high school in three years and entering college or the work early has become increasingly popular in recent years. While some may argue that this is a good idea, I believe that it is not a good way for students to start forming themselves for the future.

First, completing only three years of high school can limit the amount of knowledge that students gain. High school is designed to provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in college and in the workforce. By completing only three years of high school, students may miss out on important information that will affect them in the future. This can make it difficult for them to select courses or to find work that aligns with their interests and abilities.

Second, students who graduate early may not have the necessary experience or skills to enter college or the workforce. Responsibility is a crucial skill that is developed through homework, projects, and teamwork in high school. By completing only three years of high school, students may not have had the opportunity to develop this skill. Additionally, they may not have had the time to explore their interests or to develop the necessary skills for their chosen field.

Finally, I believe that schools that allow students to graduate early are not thinking about the welfare of their students. While it may seem like a good idea to get students out of school early, the reality is that it can be a rushed process. Students who graduate early may not have had the time to fully understand the material or to ask questions. This can lead to difficulties in college or in the workforce, and can ultimately limit their opportunities for success.

In conclusion, while the idea of finishing high school in three years and entering college or the workforce early may seem appealing, I believe that it is not a good way for students to start forming themselves for the future. By completing only three years of high school, students may miss out on important information, may not have the necessary experience or skills, and may not have had the time to fully understand the material. It is important for schools to prioritize the welfare of their students and to provide them with the necessary time and resources to succeed.",1,569
"State Senator I do wish for you to change the Electoral College to a popular vote for the President of the United States. The Electoral College is just a longer system of closing the President of the United States, why go through a longer process instead of the states just choosing the President of TH United States. The way the Electoral College is looking to me is just another system why can't we have just one system where it is based on popular votes by the states instead of having the people on choosing what the Electors should say, why not just a straight forward vote.

To me"" The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Bob Dole I'd right to say abolish The Electoral College. "" What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on abolishing the electoral college? They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore""."" Over 60 percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency, but yet the electoral college still has its defenders"".

"" The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

"" At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner- take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend the time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio.  ",0,570
"The uncontrolled proliferation of motor vehicles in our lives has been a significant contributor to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions over the last century. As we look to the future, we must reassess this dangerous dependency. Exploring viable alternatives to our current car culture, such as improving public transit systems, promoting car-sharing programs and creating car-free residential zones can greatly benefit our society and environment. 

The suburb of Vauban in Germany signifies an innovative stride towards a car-free society. Vauban's pioneering residents have embraced life without cars - owning a car is not prohibited, but parking spaces are limited and costly (Rosenthal-Passage 2). The result of this strategy is impressive ─ 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars (Rosenthal-Passage 3). This decrease in car use has coincided with a significant increase in the quality of life in the suburb, with less noise pollution, cleaner air, and a more communal atmosphere.

Cities worldwide have also adopted similar measures to limit car usage. The French capital of Paris once enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution which cleared the air of the city significantly (Duffer, Passage 10). Bogotá, Colombia has also experienced the environmentally friendly and socially engaging benefits of having a car-free day when ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work"" (Silky, Passage 20).

American society has likewise begun to see a downward trend in car usage. Recent studies have suggested that Americans are driving less and buying fewer cars with each passing year, a trend that could greatly help in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing pollution (Rosenthal-Passage 29). Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are acknowledging this shift and are starting to rebrand themselves as ‘mobility’ companies rather than merely car manufacturers (Rosenthal, Passages 34). 

Moreover, technological advancements such as the rise of carpooling apps, better telecommuting capabilities, and shared van services have made commuting less dependent on personal cars (Rosenthal, Passage 35). Indeed, it appears that our relationship with cars is undergoing a fundamental and beneficial change.

Limiting car usage can lead to healthier, happier, and more sustainable societies. By embracing trendy and sustainable suburban life, we can ensure a greener future that reduces greenhouse gas emissions drastically, improves air quality, and contributes positively to our overall quality of life. Ultimately, in changing our relationship with cars, we can build communities that are environmentally conscious and economically vibrant, leaving a more sustainable world for future generations.",1,571
"I agree that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are many reasons for this, including the increasing popularity of public transportation, the increasing availability of alternative fuel sources, and the increasing cost of car ownership.

One of the most significant reasons for the decrease in car use is the increasing popularity of public transportation. In many cities, public transportation is becoming more and more popular, and this is likely to continue. Public transportation is more affordable than car ownership, and it is also more environmentally friendly.

Another reason for the decrease in car use is the increasing availability of alternative fuel sources. Many people are switching to alternative fuel sources, such as electric cars, hybrid cars, and fuel-cell cars. These cars are much more environmentally friendly than cars that use gasoline or diesel.

Finally, the cost of car ownership is also a reason why there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. The cost of car ownership is rising rapidly, and this is likely to continue. In addition, many people are choosing to live in cities where public transportation is available. This means that they don't need to own a car.

"No one is Evan going to read these things, so there is no point in doing this test it is wasting everyone's time. Sumester exams are coming next week, and we loose almost a whole week of review on a test we are not even being graded on. The government is so messed up. Why do spoiled rich people have the only say so when it comes to my education, they don't care what happen to us because there so pulled Roman kids go to private schools were mommy or daddy can let them do what ever they want. While the rest of us have to put up with there policy and standards because sure parents have no control.

No matter how hard we try we will never change, this world is dying, and we are the once doing it. No the animals not the earth not the cars, us the human race is killing the plant, we are the biggest producers of solution, we drive the cars we burn focal fuels we are the ones killing our world. When TH time comes the human race is going to have to find a new place to live became the world is going to be so toxic that no living thing will be Abel to survive on earth. The ones that will be blame will be us and if we kill this planet it is only right that the human race dies with it.

Right now the world is changing there are people that think its no big deal and others that think it's the end of the world. I real don't know what to think. it's in human nature to be selfish and only worry about ourself so yeah we don't Evan care about ourselves as a group or outer generations Evan wild animals know the important of passing on outer genes. Wild animals clearly understand what we humans seem to always forget, we are all going to one day die. We won't be here forever and as a seems we need to worry about our future generations and where will that live and how will they revive.

We all love the time when we are teens and the big highlight of that time in our lives is that we start to drive.

The air will be so polluted so toxic that it will be impossible to breath. We are killing ourself, and we are ignoring that fact if we don't change then we are all done for.

At the end of the day if we as a species don't change we are never going to help this world survive.

"Gun control is a big issue in lots of countries and there's a lot of different opinions on it. Me personally I'm against stricter gun control laws. I think people should be able to have guns if they want them.

First, guns are a part of our history and culture. The Second Amendment gives us the right to bear arms and its important we keep that right. Guns aren't just for hunting or protecting ourselves, they're also for recreation and sport. Lots of people enjoy going to the range and shooting guns, and if we had stricter gun control laws it would take away that right.

Another reason I'm against stricter gun control laws is that they wouldn't really do anything to stop gun violence. Criminals are still going to be able to get their hands on guns even if they're illegal. Look at places like Chicago, they have really strict gun laws, but they still have a lot of gun violence. It just shows that taking away guns from law-abiding citizens won't solve the problem.

Furthermore, guns can be used for self-defense. If someone breaks into my house, I'm not going to be able to defend myself with a knife or a baseball bat. But with a gun, I can protect myself and my family. If there were stricter gun control laws, I might not be able to have a gun and that would make me feel a lot less safe.

Finally, guns are also important for hunting. Hunting is a big part of some peoples lives, and they need guns to do it. If we had stricter gun control laws, it would be a lot harder for people to hunt and that would be unfair to them.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws aren't the answer. They would take away our rights, fail to stop gun violence, make people less safe, and hurt hunters. We should focus on other ways to stop gun violence, like better mental health support and more police presence in high crime areas.

Please grade this essay and provide feedback.

I would give this essay a C+. The essay provides some valid points against stricter gun control laws, such as the potential to infringe upon Second Amendment rights and the possibility that criminals will still be able to obtain guns illegally. However, the essay could benefit from more organization, clearer reasoning, and stronger evidence to support the author's claims.

Here are some specific areas for improvement:

1. Introduction: The introduction could be stronger. Instead of simply stating that the author is against stricter gun control laws, they could provide a brief overview of the issue and explain why it's important to discuss. Additionally, the author could provide a thesis statement that outlines their main arguments and helps guide the reader through the essay.
2. Organization: The essay jumps around between different points without a clear structure. It would be more effective to organize the essay into clear sections, each addressing a different argument against stricter gun control laws. For example, the author could have a section on the Second Amendment, a section on the effectiveness of gun control laws, and a section on the impact on hunters and recreational shooters.
3. Evidence and examples: The essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the author's claims. For example, instead of simply stating that Chicago has strict gun laws and still has gun violence, the author could provide data on the number of gun violent incidents in Chicago and compare it to other cities with similar gun laws. Additionally, the author could provide examples of instances where guns were used for self-defense or hunting.
4. Counterarguments: The essay could benefit from addressing potential counterarguments to the author's position. For example, the author could acknowledge the argument that stricter gun control laws could reduce the number of guns available for criminal use, and then provide a response to this argument. This would help strengthen the author's position and show that they have considered multiple perspectives.
5. Conclusion: The conclusion could be stronger. Instead of simply summarizing the author's points, they could provide a final thought on why their position is the best one and what steps could be taken to address the issue of gun violence while still respecting Second Amendment rights.

Overall, the essay shows potential, but could benefit from more development and refinement to make it a stronger argument against stricter gun control laws.",1,574
" Working in a team has been shown to be beneficial for both students and teachers in various ways. According to new research from Stanford University, when people are treated as partners working together, their motivation, communication skills, and overall productivity are improved. This not only leads to a better final product, but it also prepares students for future careers and job requirements.

One of the main benefits of group work is the reduction of workload. By working in a group, individuals can split up different jobs and tasks, allowing for more efficient use of time and resources. This can lead to a faster completion of projects and presentations, as well as a broader range of skills and expertise being utilized.

Group work also allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives, leading to the generation of new and innovative ideas. This diversity of thought can be a powerful tool for problem-solving and success.

Another advantage of working in a group is the ability to learn from others and develop new skills. By working with people who have different strengths and weaknesses, individuals can learn from their peers and improve their own decision-making and interpersonal skills.

While working in a group can have its benefits, there are also situations where working alone may be more effective. For example, in situations where anxiety, paranoia, or other personal factors may be present, working alone may be a better option.

Overall, working together in a team can be beneficial for both students and teachers, as it promotes constructive criticism, diversity of thought, and the development of valuable skills and expertise. By working together, individuals can achieve more and prepare for future success.",1,575
"In the text the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desperate the dangers it represents, which is correct. The text explain correctly each factor that Venus has, it also explains with details what are the dangers that being on Venus presents.

At the beginning the text, the author explain where is located Venus and what are some factors about it. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus is also the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus temperature average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than WHT we experience on our own planet, it means that Venus is unable to have humans living there, because the factors like temperature, water, and ways to get food are so complicated. The fact of Venus being the second planet from the sun makes it a lot more dangerous for a human to be there.

Scientific explain that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. People ask ""Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"", well Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, it means that Venus was the most similar of the 8 planets in the solar system that looks more similar to the Earth, they believe that really long time ago Venus was covered with oceans, and it could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters, which is another idea that makes the author think about know more about Venus.

Now The National Aeronautics and Space

Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The NASA has some projects in mind to do one of them is to send mechanical computers to Venus to take pictures and videos that way they can have a better idea of how Venus looks like. They are trying to use the same mechanical computers that they use during World War II, because mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, it means that the NASA plans to send an electronic device to Venus just to see the place and star planning a visit, the would Adam the device that way it could resist the different factor that are found on Venus.

Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.",0,576
"I don't think completely driverless cars are a good idea at all, for many reasons. The price on those cars would be an outrageous amount that only rich people would be able to afford. A driverless car is also just another way for people to be lazy, someone is always trying to invent something just so people can do less work and I think that's honestly really stupid. I don't think it would be very fun to have a driverless car anyway, all you would do is sit in a car until you get where you're going. In my opinion it's more fun to drive at your own speed and physically on your own. It's like everyone wants the world to run on robots! What fun is that though? I don't see why anybody would want to depend on a robot to do literally everything for them, that's just no fun.

Dear [Principal's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my opinion regarding the school's cell phone policy. I understand that you are considering two options: Policy 1 and Policy 2. In my view, Policy 1 is a better option. Here are some reasons why I believe so:

Firstly, allowing students to bring phones to school can be beneficial in case of an emergency. For example, if a student feels sick or if there is an emergency at home, having a cell phone would enable the student to contact their parents or guardians quickly. This is important for the safety and well-being of the students.

Secondly, many parents want their children to have a cell phone with them at school so that they can keep in touch with them. This can help parents to monitor their child's activities and ensure that they are safe.

Thirdly, students can use their cell phones to stay organized and keep track of their schedules. This is especially beneficial for high school students who have busy schedules with classes, after-school activities, and part-time jobs.

Finally, students can use their phones during free times such as lunch periods to connect with each other and socialize. This can foster a sense of community and belonging within the student body.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is a better option for the school's cell phone policy. It will ensure safety, enable better parent-child communication, and provide students with an efficient way of staying organized.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,

"Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.

I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also, I will not forget any information that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks.

The second reason that schools should be year-round is that students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break, and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family, but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family.

The last reason that schools should be year-round is that students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example, I love to go out with my friends in spring because it's close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. My friends and I always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun, and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. In addition, I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I don't get tired and get bad grades in school.

In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round.",0,579
"The claim that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"" is not well-supported by the passage. Throughout the passage the author explains why Venus is exceptionally hard to explore, why it hasn't explored it in 3 years, and even the intrigue that it causes. It doesn't explain the benefits of exploring Venus, and it doesn't explain the benefits of our curiosities. The passage explains more of the dangers of exploring Venus than why it is worthy to be pursued by any reason other than curiosity.

The first paragraph introduces the reader to the planet Venus describing it as an ""Evening Star"" that is easy to view from afar, but challenging to view up close. The author starts with these statements, leading the reader to the question ""Why is it challenging?"". Through the second and third paragraph it explains why it was explored and why those missions failed. This gives the reader knowledge on what Venus is and a picture of what Venus looks like, while also explaining some of the many reasons that Venus can't be explored.

In the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs we see a shift in view point, where instead of focusing on the expected ""Why should or shouldn't Venus be explored?"" the author then moves to the topic of ""Why are scientists wanting to explore Venus?"". The answer? The author explains that the reason behind all the searching for ways to explore Venus is merely curiosity. The author also explains the approaches to explore Venus, that NASA is taking, because scientists are curious. In the paragraphs it doesn't suggest that exploring Venus is worthy, as it only explains why exploring Venus has failed, how any missions now would fail, and what NASA is doing to approach their curiosity.

In the conclusion paragraph, the author explains that the challenge that Venus presents is what fuels the curiosity of many scientists. It also states that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."" proving that the author was not focused on proving that it is a worthy cause but more of saying, we should not be grounded because it's dangerous.

The author's suggestion is not well-supported by the claim, as it has been shown that the author only focused their attention on how dangerous and scary Venus is and not on how exploration of Venus could be beneficial to understanding and history. The author's claim would have been better supported had they focused on the benefits of exploration and why the attempts to explore Venus are important, other than the filling the questions that are asked about the hardly known planet.

"Science. Scientific. Fact.

These are the words you should have going through your mind as you wonder about the Mars landform, found by NASA's

Viking 1; The face. The pharaoh. The man on Mars. However, there are some who... Wish to believe.

To these folks, it is also the face. The

Alien. Martian on Mars. These, are the people who we call conspiracy theorists. Conspiracy theorists are nothing more than mere people who wish to emphasize something and twist it up to make it, of course, a conspiracy. These said theorists want to change the perspective and point of view via others, and themselves as well.

However, fact cannot be contained.

When it comes to the face on Mars, as previously explained, there is indeed, fact over opinion. In many aspects, not to mention. Landforms, shadows, and shading galore. In pictures, the face seems to contain basic details to give t the ""person"" type of vibe off. However, there is just one problem.

With the face being known as looking human, there are details still missing. Such as, the rest of the body. There would possibly be an outline of something more around the face, or where a body may be. We cannot go down and literally dig on Mars, therefore pictures were, or are the next big thing.

There is a lot of shadowing going around on Mars. The thick clouds, the different angles of rays of lights honing through.

This leads us to our final conclusion. The face is a landform. With the precise shadowing and the shape of some sort of facial structure, who would know what to think. Blaming conspiracy theorists is not a preferred move, however, the theorists may forget to use fact. I believe, fact is that the face is a mere landform. An artwork of space.

Some, however, wish to believe. Maybe, we should let them. ",0,581
"The issue of raising the minimum wage in our country is a topic of much debate. While some argue that it is necessary to ensure that workers are paid fairly and can support themselves and their families, others contend that raising the minimum wage would have negative economic consequences. After careful consideration of the various factors involved, I believe that raising the minimum wage is necessary to address issues of income inequality and improve the lives of low-wage workers.

One of the main reasons why I support raising the minimum wage is that it would help to reduce income inequality in our society. According to recent statistics, the top 1% of earners in our country earn more than 40 times what the bottom 90% earn. This is an unsustainable situation that has negative consequences for our economy, as it limits the purchasing power of the vast majority of our citizens. Raising the minimum wage would help to address this issue by giving workers at the bottom of the income ladder a much-needed boost.

Another reason why I support raising the minimum wage is that it would help to lift many workers out of poverty. Currently, many workers in our country earn wages that are below the poverty line, even if they work full time. This means that they struggle to make ends meet and are often forced to rely on government assistance programs to survive. By raising the minimum wage, we could ensure that these workers are paid a fair wage for their labor and can support themselves and their families.

Finally, I believe that raising the minimum wage would have positive economic consequences. Contrary to what some opponents of raising the minimum wage argue, studies have shown that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to job losses or reduced economic growth. In fact, some studies have found that raising the minimum wage can actually stimulate economic growth, as it gives workers more money to spend on goods and services. This, in turn, can create new jobs and help to drive economic growth.

In conclusion, I believe that raising the minimum wage in our country is necessary to address issues of income inequality, lift workers out of poverty, and stimulate economic growth. While there may be some short-term costs associated with raising the minimum wage, I believe that the long-term benefits far outweigh these costs, both for workers and for the economy as a whole.",1,582

"Have your parents ever forced you to do a sport? You usually end up not having fun. If you're doing activities against your will, why would you want to bring that to school? Extracurricular activities shouldn't be enforced because it interferes with the parents' schedule, it takes away the students' factor of choice, and it prevents teachers from going home at their typical time.

To start off, enforcing after school activities isn't a great idea because it can interfere with parents' schedules. For example, parents might not be able to pick up their kids late, possibly due to the fact that they need someone to help out with their younger children. If kids are held after school, the parents will need to rearrange their schedule in order to be there for their kids. In addition, this policy could prevent the parents from being able to pick their kids up. Depending on how late the extracurricular activities run, parents could be busy with other things, such as grocery shopping, by the time their kid gets out of school. Also, some parents depend on public transportation. If there isn't a conveniently scheduled bus, the child won't have a way to get home. These scenarios demonstrate how enforcing clubs, sports, or groups can intervene with parents' schedules.

Secondly, having extracurricular activities after school as a priority isn't a good idea because it takes away the student's factor of choice. Adding on, children won't be as independent as they would have been, which will affect them later in life. If they don't build their individuality now, then they could possibly have trouble with it in years to come. In addition, students could feel controlled. If these policies are made, kids could feel like they don't have a say in what goes on in their space of education. Also, children will have to schedule their outside life around after school. They might be put in a position where they have to let go of activities they're passionate in, simply to not get in trouble at school. These three examples show why extracurricular policies will take away a child's choice.

Lastly, making extracurricular activities a necessity isn't a great decision because it forces teachers to stay later. To start, teachers have a life after school, and staying later than normal could interfere on that. Also, educators might have to complete chores, such as buying groceries, before a certain time each day. Having them stay late could throw off their whole routine. Lastly, many teachers have kids of their own. Depending on their age(s), they will get dismissed from school at different times. This is why necessary extracurricular activities will affect a teacher's schedule.

As shown in these paragraphs, enforcing extracurricular activities can affect the parents' everyday plan, prevent kids from making their own choices, and interfere with teachers' after school life. Holding back students affects more than just the kids. It affects everyone involved, and more. With these explanations, hopefully you won't be forced to play a sport or join a group again.",0,585
"Dear Principal,

Hi, my name is STUDENT_NAME, and I am a student at your school. I believe that policy 2, ""do not allow students to have phones at school at all"", is the better policy. I think this because students might try to cheat on tests with their phones, get distracted during class or distract others, and the phones might get lost or stolen which would destroy the tight community.

Students might not follow the rules of turning the phone off during class time. They're most likely to use it to cheat on a test. For example, if you were a student and just spent all of last night working on your homework, got almost no sleep, and you suddenly realize that there's a big test today that you forgot to study for. Would you as a student go with the F? Or would you try to cheat on your cell phone so that you could pass the test? Students don't like getting bad grades because their parents ground them or punish them for it. If students can have a way out of getting this F on their test which would later pull down their final grade, then they would do it.

""Beep, beep,"" the cell phone rings. You're taking a test, and you look up to see that the kid in front of you is texting. The annoying tap of the keyboard distracts you from your work, and it starts to get harder and harder to think. You lose your train of thought. ""Time's up,"" the teacher says, and you groan, because you knew the answer to the last question, but because of the cell phone, you forgot what to write. Now instead of getting an A on your quiz, you are getting a B. This is what happens when kids bring their cell phones to school. Kids become busy with texting and don't do what they're supposed to and/or it leads to other kids not being able to do what they're supposed to since they're constantly being distracted by the person in front of them. This brings both of these kids' grades down and hurts someone who was sure to get an A in the first place. When cell phones distract other people, it's unfair to them because they were focused on the first place, but because of someone else's cell phone, they lost their thoughts and what they wanted to say.

The last reason I have is that cell phones might get stolen or lost and cause a heap of chaos. Imagine that you have this expensive new phone that you got on your birthday yesterday. Your parents told you not to lose it because it cost a fortune. You kept your eye on it the whole time, but during lunch, you take a quick trip to the bathroom and left your phone in your locker. When you got back, it was gone. It's not a surprise that cell phones get stolen at school. Kids like the new and latest stuff, and sometimes they can't afford it. But if they want it awful, they try to steal it. Friendships are broken, and enemies are made, because who knows who stole your phone? It could be anyone. Kids become more aware and less open to having new friends. Kids lose trust in each other which leads to the whole community to not be as close anymore.

In conclusion, the policy to not allow students to have phones at school at all is better because students might try to cheat on tests with their phones, get distracted during class or distract others, and the phones might get lost or stolen and destroy the tight community.

After reading this letter, now do you agree with me that kids shouldn't have cell phones at school?  ",0,586
"People use them to commute around various locations, and it releases harmful emissions. The object that is being referred to is a car, a car is beneficial, but people should limit car usage because it cuts down on pollution of the atmosphere, and it is not as bad as it seems to not use a car all the time, and limiting usage of cars is starting to trend.

Cars release green house gas emissions that affect the ozone layer of the atmosphere. That is a main cause as to why people should limit car usage. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog...the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" as explained in the article Paris bans driving due to smog. This shows that smog is caused a good amount by cars and has affected major cities around the world. It also showed that when less usage of cars happened there was a 60 percent decrease in congestion which is a big percentile. In paragraph 5 of the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

It is explaining that automobiles are a big part of the suburbs and is an effect on the efforts to try in cut down on green house emissions of cars. Its states in the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Some may argue that the percent of green house emissions produced by cars is not high, but in reality it is, and the numbers keep rising. If people limit the use of automobiles the numbers can be cut down and reduce pollution in areas that have heavy amounts of smog, smog affects the health of people and is toxic. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as stated in the article Paris bans driving due to smog this shows that driving is a major contributor to smog and can be reduced by people limiting the usage of cars.

Limiting car usage is not so bad and can even promote a happier lifestyle as shown in the articles about limiting driving. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said a media trainer and a mother of two who's statement is said in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows even when the people of the community of Vauban, Germany, experience a fortuitous lifestyle. "" Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a move, ent called ""smart planning"" as stated in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows that limiting car usage is a ""trend"" and it leads to a positive outcome that affects generations to come. People around the world are also taking up the movement of limiting car usage, in Bogota, Columbia a business man named Carlos Arturo said ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" as referred to in the article Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá this shows that not only the advantages of limiting car usage is decrease in air pollution but can also benefit the individual. 'If the pattern persist sand many sociologists believe it Willie will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" as explained in the article The End Of Car Culture.

This is relating to the pattern of how in America the buying of cars is going down since 2005. Which as result of that occurring has benefited or will benefit the environment. This shows how more and more people are traveling less by car.

The advantages of limiting car use far outlay the disadvantages of not using a car. This means that people are during more to commute less by car and more by eco-friendly transportation like bikes. The limiting of car usage not only impact people now but will do so in the future of the world and if not changed will result in the mass pollution of the globe.",0,587
"In 'Making Mona Lisa Smile', the Facial Action Coding System purpose is described as to enable computers to read human emotions. Should it be brought into classrooms? I believe that it should, as it will engage students in lessons, content will be taught more efficiently and effectively, and students academic performances will improve.

If emotion reading technology is brought in to classrooms, it will spark interest in them. As Dr. Huang explains,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could help students focus on the material, better helping their comprehension and understanding, therefore improving their academic performances.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System should be introduced to classrooms. Students will value the impact it will have on the content being taught. Why keep the facial reading technology from students when it can benefit them?  ",0,588
"Dear senator of Florida state,

I believe the United States should get rid of the electoral college as we all know the electoral college consists of 538 sectors in which a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. In response to this the citizens of the U.S.A. are technically not voting for the president but voting for the group of electors chosen by the candidate's political party in which as stated in source 1

""You are actually voting for your candidate's electors.""

As stated in source 2 voters cannot always control who they are voting for and voters often get confused about the electors and voting for the wrong candidate.

The evidence to support this claim is the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis of the century. State legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Evidence form source 2 goes back to 1960 when segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing democratic electors with new electors that did not support and oppose John F. Kennedy thus proving that the electoral college cannot be trusted. Another reason why the electoral college is unfair to the people is because of the winner-takes-all system in each state due to the candidates not being in the state and focus only on the race between ""swing"" states. Evidence from the 2000 campaign states seventeen states didn't see candidates at all.

Most worrying would be the prospect of the tie in the electoral vote by any means in that type of case the election would be assigned for the House of Representatives where state delegations vote on the president because each state cast only one vote.

An example of this would be the representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have more to say including the representative from California who represents 35 million voters. Those voters vote for one party for president and one for congress, the decision of the house can barely be reflected on the will of the people. Supporting this is the election in 1968 in which a shift of 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election another election in 1976 a tie would occur if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.

Though the electoral college is an anachronism it is not democratic in a modern sense because the electors are the ones who choose the president not use the people though each party has to select of slate of electors who are entrusted to vote for the party's nominee. Although the electoral college method despite sits lack of Democratic pedigree is still used today it's because of its certainty of outcome the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds his share of the popular vote, and also avoids run off elections to happen. Another reason why the electoral college method is still used today is as stated in source 3 because it restores weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the MAL- appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The electoral college requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.

Even though these reasons oppose my claim as stated in source 2 the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational.

An example of this was in 2012 when Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote against 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney

Basically what the electoral college method is a method where only the electoral vote is more important than the popular vote or the peoples vote.

In which It supports my claim when I said the people are not voting for the president but for the group of electors who support the candidate. In the example of 2012 Obama vs Romney Obama won because of the percentage of the electoral vote which means that a candidate that is running for president can win the election if the electoral vote surpasses the popular vote.

"Dear State Senator, I believe the electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote because, the electoral college is unfair to voters. According to the article

The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,

""

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This doesn't seem fair at all, people put in their votes thinking they are voting for their candidate, but instead a group of electors makes the decision for them. It also doesn't seem right that the voters can't control who their electors vote for.

In the

Indefensible Electoral College article it also says that ""In the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" That doesn't seem right at all, if a candidate has the most popular vote they should be elected president since he is obviously the one the voters want as their president. It shouldn't be up to the electors to just pick anyone they want just because they have the power to do so.

Some people may think that the electoral college is just fine the way it is, for example in the article

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, the author seems to agree with this way of voting and thinks the electoral college is worth keeping because there is a certainty of outcome and thinks that the voters in the ""Swing States"" should be the one to decide the election because they have more information and attention from the candidates. Is that fair?  All states should get the same amount of attention and information from the candidates because all the votes are important and is the outcome ever really certain? How would we know the outcome of the election if the votes we put in all depend on a group of electors who could just pick whoever they like just because they can? How does that seem fair at all that the voters votes don't really matter and even if the candidate does get the most popular vote, the candidate still might not come out as the winner of the overall election?

"Venus is a rather intriguing planet that mankind would have a great interest in studying. Venus' great danger is what's stopping us from examining it up close. The author tries to say that overcoming this danger is worth dealing with to explore Venus, however. I believe their claim is valid and that there is value of trying to study the planet, even with these dangerous conditions. There's even a decent chance of working around the risks. The author uses reasons like it's the most Earth-like planet, studying Venus from a ship orbiting around the planet isn't insightful enough to learn much, and that NASA is even coming up with different methods of studying the planet to justify their idea.

There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Venus was originally similar to Earth in quite a few ways. The planet was likely covered with oceans that could've been able to support life. Venus also had other features like rocky sediment, craters, valleys, and mountains. Venus is also sometimes the closest planet to Earth, often swapping back and forth with Mars being the closest. This evidence shows that it's likely Venus was essentially an alternate version of Earth.

It's also a good point that hovering above the planet and observing it just isn't effective enough at gathering information. Since the atmosphere is impenetrable to light, photography and videography of the surface is near pointless. The inability to go down to the ground and collect samples of the materials, substances, and gases hinders our ability to understand the planet. Researchers are even considering innovating space technology to allow us to gather some form of meaningful knowledge. We need to advance past observing from an orbital space station and find a way to get down there.

NASA realizes that problems could be solved with the right approach. They've tested how long some electronics made of silicon carbide could survive in Venus' conditions and so far, the results have shown that there is potential. Building resistant computers may also collect information on the planet, but mechanical computers may get this job done the best. Mechanical computers were used in World War II, but they were sturdier than modern computers and don't require any electronics to function. If one method of getting closer to the planet doesn't work, we could always try again with another.

Overcoming the dangers of Venus is currently one of the toughest challenges of space exploration we've seen yet. With enough determination and patience though, we can find a way to work around this dilemma; especially since NASA clearly hasn't given up working on solutions. This may be necessary too; our current method of studying this place just isn't that good. The reward may be worth the effort too since Venus is one of the most interesting planets we've attempted exploring. Let's just hope that this won't stop us from wanting to discover the whole universe.",0,591

"I think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is real. I say this because if you look into the computer and have an emotion on your face it will tell you what facial expression you are showing. For example if your looking mean then the computer will think that your angry at this moment. Just how people can look at you and tell how you're feeling the new technology can do it to. If the new technology did not work to describe people's expression then the computer would not do anything, computers are a smart technology and can do lots of things.

It is a good idea to read the emotional expressions of students because computers know how your feeling once you look into it. To figure out how you're feeling the computer will take a 3-d picture model of your face. The new technology could only tell six emotions which are happiness, surprise,anger, disgust,fear, and sadness.

The expressions people make are very universal. The new technology cannot describe how you're feeling if you're not showing no emotion. If you smile while ads come on the computer while assume that you're demonstrating the Mona Lisa facial expression because you're smiling and that's what they or she wanted you to do.

"Losing a privilege to drive a car is a risk. Some people use cars for there main transportation. In some places you will found countries and nations that don't limits you to drive a car anymore. Those places are Germany, Paris, and Bogotá, Columbia. These cities limit the right of driving a car, but the citizens agree in many ways.

In Vauban, Germany the citizens are happy that most people don't have cars. The citizens think it's a great idea no cars are on the street. They have certain places that you can park if you own a car. There's only two places you can park, and those two places are the large garages at the edge of the development, and you have to buy a space for $40,000, along with a new home. There is 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. They think that cars would've been too much for them and that since the cars has been gone it has had a big impact in the German society that has lower the transportation bills 80 percent down by the law.

In Paris, the cars have been moved off the street due to smog. The smog happened when the pollution started. There was almost 4,000 drivers fined for refusing to follow the orders. Paris has also created a new tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. The diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Paris averages more smog than any other European capitals.'' Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compare with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. The Paris people have come to a conclusion that its cars and diesel has effected its community and such more but it's the main reason why Paris has the advantages of limiting car usage to the people.

In Bogotá, columbia it's a new program that sets to spread to other countries. After the program started Colombians have begin hiking, bike riding, and skating to reduce the traffic jams. It's the third straight year cars have been banned with just taking a bus and only taxis for a day. In the capital of 7 million people the goal is to try and promote an alternative transportation and reduce the smog pollution. The violators will have to face $25 fines.''

"Hey, so I have to write this essay about how going to school in person is way better than online school, and I have to tell ya, it's kinda hard. Like, I know online school is convenient and all, but there's just something about being in a classroom with other people that makes it better. Here's why:

First, you can't beat the social aspect of in-person school. Being around other people helps you stay focused and engaged. When you're in a classroom, you can see your classmates' reactions and facial expressions, and you can tell when they're struggling with something. It's way easier to work together and help each other out when you're in the same room. Plus, you can make friends and stuff, which is important for, like, your social skills and stuff.

Another reason is that you can get more hands-on learning when you're in a classroom. Like, when we're learning about science or history, we can do experiments and stuff that's way more fun when you're in person. You can't really replicate that same experience online, you know? And it's not just about the experiments, but also the discussions and debates that happen in class. When you're in person, you can hear different perspectives and opinions, and it's way easier to have a meaningful conversation.

Lastly, in-person school is way better for learning retention. When you're in a classroom, you're more likely to remember what you learned because you can see and hear the material being presented. It's way easier to get distracted when you're online, and before you know it, you've been browsing Reddit for like, an hour. Plus, when you're in person, you can ask questions and get immediate feedback, which is way better than trying to figure things out on your own online.

So yeah, in conclusion, going to school in person is way better than online school. It's just more engaging, more interactive, and way better for learning retention. I mean, sure, online school might be convenient, but it's not worth it if you're gonna miss out on all that in-person learning. Just my",1,595
"In this article they are talking about emotional are getting describe by computers. They are able to know when you're happy, sad, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. They can tell your emotion by your movements of the facial muscles you rise your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis Boris around your mouth tighten your lips to show anger. One thing that technology is doing that I think is super cool because they are using technology to read students. I think it's a great idea because maybe the students doesn't understand the computer, and it can explain its self and I also thinks it's a good ideal because what if the students was bored, and it could make it more fun for the students. I think this would be pretty cool because if the students is having a bad day the computer would cheer them up and put a smile on their faces.

This is a great ideal because say if the students is coming confused or bored it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes some computer need to understand that, too

It's also a good ideal for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking on her his or her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc. Having a computer that understand how they feel will make them feel better and at least they know there is something that understand how they feel.

Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks this facial movement in a real face or in the painted face by weighting the different unit, the software can even identify mixed emotion this should that some kids might not like the computer even though it's understand how they feel.

Conculsion It's mostly trying to let the students know that they understand how they sometimes feel, and they know the students not gonna talk to their friends or teacher about it, so they want to bring computer even though you can't talk to them, but they want the students to know that the computer understand and try to cheer them up.",0,596
"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are several compelling reasons for this. 

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving is distracting and can take a driver's attention away from the road. Talking, texting, checking social media or apps - all of these activities require a person to look away from the road and focus on their phone instead. This increases the risk of accidents as the driver is not fully concentrating on their driving. Numerous studies have shown that cell phone use while driving can be as dangerous as or more dangerous than drunk driving. 

Secondly, cell phones can enable risky multitasking behaviors while driving. Texting requires visual, manual and cognitive attention from the driver as they type messages and read responses. This divides a person's focus between driving and communicating, making it difficult to do both safely at the same time. Even hands-free calling still divides attention audibly and cognitively. Limiting cell phone use helps discourage distracted driving behaviors.

Thirdly, prohibiting cell phones reduces the number of potential distractions inside the vehicle. With phones stowed away or powered off, drivers are less tempted to check notifications, scroll through apps or engage in other non-driving activities using their device. This creates a safer driving environment with fewer internal and external distractions competing for a person's focus.

In conclusion, the dangers of distracted driving are well documented. Allowing unrestricted cell phone use provides unnecessary opportunities for risking lives on the road. For the safety of all drivers and pedestrians, cell phones should not be used by motorists in any way when they are operating a moving vehicle. Public safety should take priority over personal communication needs while driving.",1,597
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun, and is earth's neighbor. Venus has a very thick atmosphere, and is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide. This planet can reach temperatures up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists are discussing visits to its surface, but is it safe enough?

No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, it's been three decades since a spaceship landed Venus. Conditions on Venus are way worse than here on earth, Venus's environment could crush a submarine, which is capable of reaching deep into the ocean. Venus's weather is extremely hot, temperatures around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, is still very difficult to survive in, so in Venus there is no chance.

Many scientists observe Venus from a camera that orbits above the planet, but it only provides limited insight, because the atmosphere is very dense. It will be very expensive to build a machine to land on Venus, just to end up being crushed by this atmosphere. The conditions on Venus make it uncapable to be studied, and there's no point in studying it.

"Dear State Senator,

I would like for you to change it to popular vote because ...

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas for example, and you wanted to vote for

John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 344 democratic electors pledged to

Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place ? It depends on the state, sometimes state conventions, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control who their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

Also, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

Most worrying thing is that of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote of the president.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is just unfair to the voters. Because of the winner - take - all systemic each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Therefore, you should change it to popular vote, not electoral college.  ",0,599
"If I've missed a day of class and I need the notes, would it be beneficial to watch it from home? While, that may sound ideal: the chances of students failing to understand or lack of effort due to laziness are extremely high. Miscommunication or technology failure is going to be the downfall of this idea. And whose to day students will actually participate? As a student my brain does a shut-off after school, I try to do everything here because I have a real hard time focusing at home. I know that a lot of other students are also like that, we'll say we'll have a chat with our teacher, but distractions get in the way. There are so many flaws in this idea due to students needing to be in school alone.

Students going online to watch a live broadcast of their teachers' lesson would be an overall negative.

One of the most frustrating pains is when your computer is being slow, and you have something important to do. It is an unfair disadvantage to the student to missed school, they have to now try to listen when their connection is poor. It may cause to the student to give up and just not watch the lesson. Teens can have little patience for technology messing up. We tend to just turn it off or keep messing with it until it no longer functions correctly. Technology may be ten times better than in the past, the technology we use still have kinks that we haven't worked out, video calling is one that would make video chatting lessons difficult.

Misunderstanding what the teacher is saying is extremely high. Computers can be extremely hard to understand through. Talking doesn't always have the best quality, so if a student is trying to listen through poor audio, the miscommunication chance is greater. Considering the students who take high level courses, they need to hear every detail of the lesson. Sometimes we need that classroom environment to push us to get where we need to be. I am extremely driven, but as soon as I leave school I lose some of that drive. I get lazy with leaving school and I know for myself, I can't focus on school as well outside of school.

Students come in all different brains, from being well-behaved and a good listener, to absolutely unable to sit down and focus. We can't risk that for the students who are not as well-behaved, they just need the extra push from their teachers to actually get things done. If we let every student get the chance to just go online and watch it, there's going to be a lot that forget to go on or that just didn't want to, so they don't. When you're teaching adolescence, you have to be there for them, not just as a teacher, but a motivator. It makes it difficult to be motivational when your student could just turn you off. Though, most students would be responsible, the students that aren't, are going to go out of their way to avoid attending class. They'll say ""Oh, I get it tomorrow."","" I have Ms. Example at home, I can skip out today."" and avoid it altogether. I am extremely driven, but as soon as I leave school I lose some of that drive. I get lazy with leaving school and I know for myself, I can't focus on school as well at home.

It sounds like a great idea to have it available online, but knowing certain work ethics and how some students think; the idea of having online video chatting for lessons is a really negative outcome. The teenager brain can be aloof, and we can sometimes lose our interest in something if we're not in an environment were we're always around it, we can get extremely lazy. Our efforts would get low, and our drive would decrease. Ultimately causing our grades to duffer and our chances of actually learning, go down.",0,600
"Living in a community without the use of cars can be extremely beneficial. It might seem odd to say such an idea because we have lived in towns with a lot of car usage all of our lives. Hadron Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car can be very stressless. This is because you do not have to worry about wrecking your car, keeping up with the insurance payments, talking care of it (such as oil changes) and eventually, having to buy a new one which can be very expensive.

Another reason why not having a car is beneficial is that it can help the environment. Right now, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This number keeps on climbing because more and more people are buying cars which just puts more gas into the environment.

An even greater benefit of living in a community without cars is that you can get more exercise. Sitting in the car everyday going to and from work for 2 hours is not being productive. However, in the existing car-free communities, all the necessary store are in walking or biking distance from the majority of the population. So, the commute to work for most people can be just like getting a daily exercise and staying in shape.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that living in a community without cars would be a change for the better. It would help with everyone's financial situations and everyone would have better health because you would have to bike and walk everywhere. As of lately, it has seemed like less and fewer people have started to use cars. The number of miles drive peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since. In April 2013 the average number of miles driven was 9 percent below the peak in 2005.",0,601
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, That's because they want to choose the right decision and if they choose wrong, then something terrible could happen, or you will just regret it.

But in my opinion, I think you should always ask a friend, or a family member, for advice even if you think your advice is wiser/better than theirs.

Seeking multiple advice from different people is good because it makes gets you thinking about what to do in that situation like, ""do I do this does I do that!"" so you gather all the advice that you got from the people, you asked, and you talk about it see if that's what you want to do, and you do it like I said your advice isn't bad, you just think that the other advice is better, like say you got accepted to two different colleges take your own advice then go get more advice from a family member or a friend, So you got their advice you compare it to yours, and see which one you like more.

But if they don't, it would be wise to ask for assistance to make decision with experts so that way they can have in idea of what decision to make. Because if they had made their own decision that they had regret that would have been there issue for not making a wise chose. But anyway people who are confidence can make their own choices.

They ask for guidance so that they can have more of an idea of what they are going to decide which gives them a higher opportunity to decide which could led up to a good or bad situation. It all depends on the person who is determent to decide.

I suggest that both ways all depend on a person because we all have our different way's and many can cause a huge impact on people life the more info you know the better you have to understand what path you are taking because new's had speed that people are making wrong decision which led to be endanger.

"Would you like to be able to not drive you car or to drive your car? I would like to have driveless cars. Can you imagine the time that you get into to your car and the only thing you have to do is say car start? Well that where are cars are transforming into we are starting to get cars that we don't have to drive the cars drive for us.

Driverless cars well also help the driver. In the text it says"" they still alert driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork accidents."" So the driverless car well also let the driver know when to take over manually by vibration of the seat. So the driver well always have to be aware of what's going on. Driverless cars well also get you to where you're going in the shortest amount of time possible.

I think if we have self-driving cars there won't be as many car crashes as there have been in the past couple of years. From people texting and driving or driving drunk or stuff like that. In paragraph 7 the text says'' They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves."" So if the drivers are careless and not paying attention to the road like there text or something the care can stop for them and not cause a crash.

That's why I agree with the idea of a driverless car. I can see why some people wouldn't want a driverless car because what if the car crashes or something went wrong with it, you might be the one responsible for the car crashing. So I can see why they might not want a driverless car. I think that driverless cars well be a good thing to have in 2020 ",0,604
"There is no doubt that college graduates earn higher salaries than those with less education. In the United States, for example, the median earnings for workers with a bachelor's degree is nearly double that of workers with only a high school diploma. This is why it is important that college graduates pay the full cost of their education.

There are several reasons why college graduates should pay the full cost of their education. First, they are the ones who benefit the most from their degree. They are the ones who will earn higher salaries and have more opportunities because of their education. Second, college graduates can afford to pay the full cost of their education. They are not struggling to make ends meet like many non-college graduates. Finally, paying the full cost of their education will help to ensure that colleges and universities are able to provide a quality education to all students.

There are some who would argue that college graduates should not have to pay the full cost of their education because they already have a higher salary. However, this is not a valid reason. College graduates benefit from their education in many ways, and they should be the ones to pay for it.

"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States should be replaced with a popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give small states more influence, I believe it no longer serves that purpose and has significant drawbacks.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that presidential candidates tend to focus their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. This means that the vast majority of states receive little attention. Popular vote opponents argue this will encourage higher voter turnout, but data finds turnout is often lower in competitive swing states that receive abundant candidate attention under the current system. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might ignore low-population states. However, with a popular vote system, every vote would count equally regardless of what state it comes from. Candidates would still aim to appeal to as broad a range of voters as possible to win a majority. As it stands now, plenty of citizens’ votes essentially do not count at all since the winner-take-all Electoral College system means their state will go one way or the other. This diminishes voter confidence and turnout over time.

A final counterclaim is that the popular vote could result in concerns over recounts and disputes in very close elections. However, recounts and legal disputes have occurred under the Electoral College as well. More importantly, the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide should win, regardless of narrow margins, since that better respects the principles of majority rule and equal representation. The needs and voices of the most Americans would be represented under a national popular vote.

For these reasons, I believe transitioning to a popular vote system would increase voter engagement and ensure that every eligible citizen's vote carries the same weight, regardless of their state of residency. It would make the outcome of elections aligns more directly with the aggregate preferences of Americans nationwide. I hope you will consider supporting reforms toward this end. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,606
"Advertisements are everywhere in our daily lives, from billboards to social media. They aim to promote and sell products, but do they always depict them accurately? In my opinion, most advertisements exaggerate and make products seem much better than they really are. There are several reasons why I believe this to be true.

Firstly, advertisers often use persuasive language and eye-catching visuals to grab our attention and create a desire to own the product. They make bold claims about the benefits of the product, often using superlatives like ""the best,"" ""the fastest,"" or ""the most effective."" For example, a skincare product might claim to reduce wrinkles by 90%, or a diet pill might promise to help you lose 10 pounds in a week. These claims are often exaggerated or based on limited evidence, and they can create unrealistic expectations for consumers.

Secondly, advertisements often focus on the positive aspects of the product and ignore any potential drawbacks or limitations. They might show a car speeding along a scenic highway, but they won't mention that it gets terrible gas mileage or has a high maintenance cost. They might show a beautiful model using a particular makeup brand, but they won't mention that the product contains harsh chemicals that can damage your skin. By omitting these details, advertisers create a false impression of the product and deceive consumers.

Finally, advertisements often use emotional appeals to persuade consumers to buy the product. They might use humor, nostalgia, or fear to create a connection with the audience and make them feel that they need the product to be happy, successful, or safe. For example, an ad for a luxury car might show a wealthy couple enjoying a glamorous lifestyle, implying that owning the car will make you feel wealthy and successful. These emotional appeals can be powerful, but they are often manipulative and have little to do with the actual quality or usefulness of the product.

In conclusion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They use persuasive language, ignore potential drawbacks, and rely on emotional appeals to create a false impression of the product. As consumers, it's important to be aware of these tactics and to approach advertisements with a critical eye. We should always do our own research and seek out unbiased information before making a purchase. By doing so, we can avoid falling for the hype and make informed decisions based on our own needs and preferences.

"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Cell phones are used every were. In school kids are there to learn, so why should they be able to use there phones? When you tell kids that they can use there phones they use it all day. Kids will just get distracted. There grades will drop to an all-time low. They will make the school look bad in academics.

Kids get distracted with everyday school materials what makes you think that with phones they won't just blow off there work to text. Kids would ignore the teachers and just use there phones to listen to music. Kids will use there phones just to free load, play around, and to listen to music. Not ones have I ever seen kids use there phones for work.

Kids grades are bad enough without phones. There are times were you have good kids, and they do there work. But that doesn't mean they won't just for get about grades because of their phones. I did research and statistics say that a school who let kids use there phones in school dropped 80% academically.

If a school has the best sport team or the nicest and cleanest hallways does that mean anything. NO what matters are grades. Kids will get on their phones and do everything but there work. If the school shows a big drop in grades why would they get money? Without money, they will have to fire people.

So I recommend you to reconsider your decision on allowing kids to use there phones during school.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? It would benefit them because they can do they work in their bed, on the road, and they can turn it in whenever they want; No time limit on the work.

Turning in your work whenever you want is amazing. Who wouldn't want to turn in their work in whenever they want. You could be busy all day, maybe all week & still manage to turn your work in late. That benefits a lot, you don't have to worry about being rushed to do your work, don't have to worry about people distracting you while your trying to do your work; Its just you, you are on your own time when you are homeschooled or online classes.

Students can do their work while they're on a road trip or something. You can do online classes from anywhere. Online classes are more beneficial than home classes; Home classes are with a teacher or a parent, home classes you have to do the work right then and there. Online you can do it when you get to it, because you're all by yourself online. Students get the work done faster online too, its more sources online than with a teacher.

Being in bed while students do they work is great; They can wake up at any time and not a school scheduled time to do their work. Instead of the moving, getting dressed, to do they work at school; They can just do it when they wake up. I think this is way better than video conferencing. Video conferencing is them watching you do the work or you're following along with the class at school doing the work.

"The author claims that investigating Venus's surface is worth our time even tho there are many dangers there, because Venus at one point in time may have had similar feature that Earth does such as water, Venus has similar geological traits, and Venus is sometimes the closest planet to Earth making Venus a likely trip.

Scientist believes that one point in time Venus had oceans on its surface along with other life forms such as vegetation and maybe alien life. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" It would be a groundbreaking discovery to man kind if we were able to discover a new form of life on another planet.

Under Venus's thick atmosphere and its giant corrosive clouds, the geological formation of Venus is similar to our planet. Venus has craters and mountains like we do on Earth."" The planet has a surface rocky of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" With such similar features to our home planet it makes Venus a likely option to send mankind to visit.

During Earth's orbit, there are points in time where Mars is the closet planet to us and other times when Venus is the closest planet to us. Since Venus is closer to the sun it orbits faster than Earth while Mars is farther from the sun it has a slower orbit. Since Venus at points in time is the closest planet makes it a likely option to go visit."" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" With Venus being the closest planet at a given time makes it an ideal planet to study.

I believe the author proves a valid point on why we need to travel to Venus, because Venus could have had really similar features to Earth at one point in time, Venus also has similar geological traits, and Venus is sometimes the closest planet to Earth. With that information given to us by the author makes the idea of studying Venus a worthy pursuit despite the many dangers there are.",0,610
"Obesity is a growing problem in many countries, and it is not only affecting adults but also children. One of the main causes of obesity is the consumption of unhealthy food, especially during school hours. In this essay, I will explore the effects of obesity, healthy food options for school lunch, and how different cultures view food. Additionally, I will examine the consequences of unhealthy food choices and the financial implications of switching to healthier school lunch options. Finally, I will discuss the potential benefits of having healthier options for school lunches for both current and future generations.

Obesity is a serious health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of obesity has tripled since 1975, and it is now estimated that 39% of adults and 18% of children worldwide are overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with a range of health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.

One of the main reasons for the rise in obesity is the consumption of unhealthy food, especially during school hours. School lunches often contain high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. In addition, many school lunches are highly processed and lack essential nutrients, such as fiber and vitamins.

Different cultures view food in different ways, and this can affect the types of food that are available in school lunches. For example, in some cultures, it is considered important to have a balanced diet that includes a variety of different foods, while in others, it is more important to focus on specific foods that are considered to be traditional or culturally significant.

The consequences of unhealthy food choices can be significant, both financially and health-wise. Unhealthy school lunches can lead to increased healthcare costs, as well as decreased productivity and increased absenteeism. In addition, switching to healthier school lunch options can have a positive financial impact, as it can reduce healthcare costs and increase productivity.

In conclusion, having healthier options for school lunches can have a range of benefits for both current and future generations. By reducing the consumption of unhealthy food and promoting a balanced diet, we can help",1,611
"A car free world?! That sounds splendid! Over seventy percent of Vauban's families in Germany do not own cars, and almost fifty-seven percent sold their car to move there due to the fact that they are almost ninety percent car free. There are so many advantages on limiting your car usage.

Think of it like this, you walk outside your front door and see hundreds of big bulky cars and trucks flying by giving off greenhouse gas emissions from their tailpipes, which is not good for you at all. Is that what you want to see every morning? Or do you want to swing up that front door, smell those roses, and see all your neighbors hopping on their bikes about to ride off to work.

There are so many benefits of limiting car usage, but a main one is the health of the people. How many times a day do you see an overweight person struggling to get in or out of their car? Here in America it has become a casual sight. Now picture this, you see that same person getting on a bike and driving to and from work. How long do you think it is going to take until they start to lose weight and start to feel healthier, inside and out.

Some ignorant people say that the car industry is boosting, but I agree with those intelligent people who are seeing that the industry has been slowly declining. You see more people taking taxis, carpooling, or texting their friends to pick them up. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" -Mimi Sheller, an extremely smart professor at Drexel University. She is referring to the decline in car buying and the amount of people getting their licenses. Did you know that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 40-year-olds getting a license, while the older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age? According to a study found last year, young people driving has decreased twenty-three percent between two-thousand one and two-thousand nine.

"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that we have about someone or something when we first encounter it. They are formed quickly and often based on limited information, and can be difficult to change once they have been established. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why it is so difficult to change a first impression and provide examples to illustrate this.

One reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it is based on our experiences and expectations. We often have preconceived notions about people and situations based on our experiences, and these can influence our initial thoughts and feelings. For example, if we have had a negative experience with someone in the past, we may be more likely to have a negative first impression of them in the future. Similarly, if we have high expectations for a situation, we may be more likely to have a negative first impression if it doesn't meet those expectations.

Another reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it is often formed quickly and based on limited information. We may only have a few minutes or hours to form a first impression of someone, and we may not have had the opportunity to get to know them well. This can make it difficult to form a fair and accurate impression, as we may not have all the information we need to make a well-informed judgment. For example, if we meet someone in a professional setting, we may form a first impression based on their appearance and demeanor, but we may not have the opportunity to get to know them well and learn more about their character and personality.

A third reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it can be influenced by external factors. Our first impression of someone or something can be influenced by the environment in which we encounter it. For example, if we meet someone in a crowded and noisy environment, we may have a harder time forming a clear first impression of them. Similarly, if we encounter someone in a situation that is unfamiliar to us, we may have a harder time forming a first impression. For example, if we meet someone in a foreign country, we may have a harder time forming a first impression of them because we are in an unfamiliar environment.

In conclusion, it is difficult to change a first impression because it is based on our experiences and expectations, formed quickly and based on limited information, and influenced by external factors. These",1,613
"The author of this greatly fascinating article is informing the reader of the wildly amazing benefits of trying to explore our neighboring planet Venus but at a very dangerous and intimidatingly severe cost such as, acidic gas, unpredictable weather patterns, bone crushing gravity and blazing temperatures but in contrast gives reasons for traveling there such as the planet being a new home and a way of escape to us earthlings.

The very first severe danger, the author explains is in paragraph three as they get into the specific of the sulfuric atmosphere as stated"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" this line shows that this dangerously corrosive gas creates a huge problem for the space program NASA.

The next neighboring issue is also the extreme blazes of heat that come from the planet Venus itself show in paragraph three"" On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". The author also states that Venus temperature would ""liquefy many metals"" this piece of information reinforces the many dangers of space travel towards Venus as even an unmanned spacecraft will be torn to shreds and scorched like tissue paper.

"""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" Hadron Walter said in the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars', in the New York Times, ""I'm much happier this way."" In Vauban, Germany, people do not use cars. They find other means of transportation, such as biking and walking. In Bogotá, the construction of bicycle paths has made 118 miles of passages for residents. According to David Goldberg, ""All our development since World War II has been centered around the car."" While that is not entirely true, it does have a good point. We should move on from the all-powerful box with wheels.

One major reason for not using cars is pollution. As most of us know, pollution is bad for the environment, and for most life on Earth. Unfortunately, our use of cars and power plants is generating pollution faster than plants can take it out of the atmosphere. ""Transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions"", Elisabeth Rosenthal said. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", 60% of drivers in Paris stopped after five days of intensifying smog. That means that the smog was dense enough to where it was dangerous for drivers to go anywhere.

The article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" mentions that: ""The turnout [for car-free day] was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogotá."" Why would people continue to participate in car-free day if they hated it so much? Despite the fine of $25, it really isn't a big deal. One of the participants, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Now, how can you simply stop driving? You need to get to your job! Nobody is telling you to move to Vauban. However, biking or walking to the park could help. You don't need a car to go to your neighbor's house. They're right next door. Of course, not using cars is not going to stop the pollution from power plants, but it will certainly slow down how fast it is going into the atmosphere.

We simply can't allow pollution to go where it is going. If we all stop relying on cars to get us to places, we will have enough time to think of an easier solution. Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. There is a chance that being car-free won't be as bad as everyone thinks. It might even be enjoyable. There is also a chance that it will despise. We'll only know if we try it, now, won't we?",0,615
"The world we live in is becoming increasingly digitized, and many people question if libraries still have a significant role to play in society today. As a student in grade 7, I am aware of the vast amount of information available online, but I strongly believe that libraries remain essential institutions in the digital age. In this essay, I will argue in favor of libraries, discussing why they are still crucial for communities and individuals.

Firstly, libraries provide access to a variety of resources that might not be available to everyone online. For example, not everyone can afford to buy books or subscribe to academic journals. Libraries offer free access to these materials, allowing people from all backgrounds to access information and knowledge. Additionally, libraries provide access to computers and the internet, which is essential for those who do not have access to such technology at home. 

Secondly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can come together and learn, share ideas or simply relax. They offer a safe and quiet space for students to study, and they often host events such as book clubs, author talks, and workshops that bring communities together. These events promote social engagement and intellectual curiosity, which are essential for personal growth and development.

Thirdly, libraries have a vital role to play in promoting literacy and reading among children and young adults. Libraries offer age-appropriate books and reading programs that help to foster a love of reading in young people. Studies have shown that children who read for pleasure perform better academically, and libraries play a crucial role in providing access to reading materials and encouraging a reading culture.

Finally, libraries are essential institutions in promoting information literacy. In the age of misinformation and fake news, libraries provide a safe and reliable source of information. Librarians are trained professionals who can guide people to find accurate and trustworthy information, helping to combat the spread of falsehoods and propaganda.

In conclusion, I argue that libraries remain crucial institutions in the digital age. They provide access to resources that might not be available otherwise, serve as community hubs, promote literacy, and are essential for promoting information literacy. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, libraries will continue to play a vital role in our communities, providing access to information and knowledge for all.",1,616
"It would help to ask other people for advice, but it helps when there's more than 1 person giving you advice. Each opinion can help you simplify your question. For example if you ask one person what they think you should do but you don't like their answer someone else could help cut down what you think feels right and wrong that could help you decide. When you ask other people for advice sometimes you can feel relieved and for some reason you don't feel like you are alone anymore, and you don't have to worry as much as you used to. For example if someone were to be suicidal asking someone for help can make you feel relieved that there is a way to help that person. If you have more than one choice, but you don't seem to like some of them you can ask a friend or a parent/guardian for some help on what to do. For example if I could choose to get a pet or not maybe someone has a pet, and they could tell me the responsibility and cost of taking care of a pet. Maybe someone has experience that you don't, so maybe it would be best asking for advice from someone who is more experienced. For example if I wanted to start getting more muscle I would ask someone I know that has been doing it for a long time to help me get more muscle by teaching me what to eat and what to not eat and what to do and how. One of the most important thing before you ask advice from the person is do you believe that he/her will not lie because if he/she gives you bad advice then you can make a very wrong decision that's why you need to be able to trust the person giving you advice. ",0,617
"Have you ever wanted to get a chance to explore beautiful and foreign lands? Well then, joining the Seagoing Cowboys would definitely be the job for you. I, Luke Berger, am a former Seagoing Cowboy and I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and have crossed the Pacific Ocean twice to help those affected by World War II. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a great adventure, but it was also more than that. It opened up the world to me.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys, you get to see, and sometimes visit, amazing and beautiful places. When myself and the crew first set sail from New Orleans to deliver 335 horses to Greece, I couldn't wait to get there. I saw the Acropolis in Greece, and it was beautiful! When delivering animals to these foreign lands, I also got the side benefit of seeing a lot of Europe and China. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, explore an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

By joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you get the important, but rewarding, job of caring for those in dire need. When I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, I had no idea the happiness you receive from helping those who need help. By delivering food supplies, animals, and even more, you make these people's lives a lot easier. You are giving them food, animals to make into food, and animals to help with work. Helping these citizens really opened my eyes to the rest of the world.

The final thing I'm going to tell you about is having fun. When I was on the ship, and the animals and supplies had been delivered, we had fun on the ship. It wasn't the reason I had joined, but it is definitely a joyous side benefit. Us cowboys would play baseball and volleyball games where animals had been kept. We also held table-tennis tourneys, fenced, boxed, read, and whittled to pass the time. It's amazing what you can do when you're bored on a nearly-empty ship!

These are the reason why I believe that all able and willing men need to join the Seagoing Cowboys. You get to see wonderful lands. You also can have fun on the ships. Most importantly though, you get to help those in need. It's amazing that doing a job like this can make such an impact on people's lives. Join the Seagoing Cowboys!",0,618
"""As a grade 9 student, I would like to inform my fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage based on the passage provided. There are numerous benefits of using alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling or taking public transport. First and foremost, it is an effective way to decrease air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are the major source of pollutants that cause smog, which has harmful effects on our health and environment.

Moreover, limiting car usage can improve traffic flow and ease congestion. It can also help in reducing traffic accidents and fatalities, and increase the lifespan of our roads, which in turn saves money for the government and taxpayers.

Using cars less frequently can also lead to healthier lifestyles as walking, cycling and public transport involve some physical activity. This helps in reducing obesity, heart diseases and other related illnesses.

Furthermore, alternative modes of transportation are cheaper and save money for individuals in the long run. Owning a car involves a lot of additional expenses such as fuel, insurance, maintenance, and parking, while taking public transportation or cycling can save money on transportation expenses.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring a positive change in our society and environment. It is important for us to adopt more sustainable modes of transportation and encourage others to do the same to make our world a better and cleaner place to live in. Let us all pledge to do our bit towards a greener future.""",1,619
"Dear Principle,

I don't agree about the new policy change and I do agree in a way.

I do agree that having a higher grade average would help, but it might be too hard for kids to do. Having the grade point average higher would benefit students, parents, teachers, and the school too. If the grade point average did get set at a B range for students to be able to play sports it would make it so the kids that really want to play try harder in school and go home and actually do homework. But then you have the side of students who actually struggle at school to do homework and pay attention in class. So the side that struggles really makes the new system a problem. If you were to raise the grade point average to a B you would need a new policy for it to work too.

A new policy would possibly be different from the one the school has now.

The policy would make it so that you would get a chance to learn the subject completely and that you would have a week and a half or so to get your grade up. But this would only happen once for each class. Also, you could have grade checks every Friday of the week for any student that participates in a sport, such as football and wrestling. By making sure that kids have a B or higher the every Friday checks would make it so that kids wouldn't fall behind. Kids not falling behind means that kids would more than likely get better score on MAPS tests, MSP tests, (measure of student progress) and on CBA's (classroom based assessment). Having better score on these tests would make the school look better too. Having better state tests would get your school noticed, and the school could also get grants too. The grants would help pay for smart boards, new projectors, and more and better sports gear.

So even though having higher test scores would be difficult for some students it would bring many good things to the school too. If you were to raise the grade point average to a B for sports players it could possibly bring new gear and equipment for the sports teams. So principle make the grade point average a B or higher for sports, it could improve the school heavily.",0,620
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming' It tells with positive and negative facts about driverless cars. I believe that there should be driverless cars this is where I stand. Driverless cars have been worked on for a while now. So far they have developed software to help the advancement of driverless cars. I think that driverless cars will provide more of a positive impact on the world than a negative one.

Driverless cars have been worked on for a while now. It's been since the 1980s the used sensors attached to the wheels of cars of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, they are more advanced with better response times than ever when endanger and all around. In the late 1950s, receivers to capture radio signals TH guide the car on a special track.

So far they have developed software to help the advancement of driverless cars. In 2013, There was a development called ""Traffic Jam Assistant""announced by BMW. This helps steer, accelerate, and break themselves. However they notify the driver when it doesn't have the skills to drive it in a certain situation. It can function up to 25 mph. There are also vibrations in the driver's seat to notify of an emergency. This can mean that the driver still needs to stay concentrated on the road when the situations occur. There have been ideas considering using flashlights life on the windshield and other heads up display just in case.

Driverless carts really aren't driverless now. Most of the software for the car still needs someone to drive the car. The software hasn't really advanced so much the needs to be no one concentrating on the road ahead. These are just to help progress the advancement for driverless cars and increases safety. So even if the software fails the car still has the driver attention on the road. All they can do now is help the driver and other become more AFE when driving in case anything happens.

In conclusion, the driverless cars now aren't completely driverless and needs the drivers skills so that means it can provide more safety than less. If it can continue in success the driverless cars will be much more safe than now. Driverless cars can use half the fuel of today's cars and can offer more flexibility when driving. The cars can have better response times than humans can in the future. Driverless cars will provide more of an increase in safety then what we have now in the future.",0,621

I believe we should change the election from the Electoral College to popular vote because, with the Electoral College people are voting for a slate of electors not an actual presidential candidate, it is unfair for our American people, and most people prefer the popular vote.

By voting for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors who vote for the presidential candidate. This means that our votes don't really count for much. It also means that even though we voted for someone the slate could have voted for someone completely different. Also, we the people have no idea who the electors are. Who even picks them? The electors that are chosen depends on the state, sometimes it's the state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes it can be the presidential candidate himself. Some voters didn't even see campaign ads, so how did they choose their presidential caudate? They didn't, the Electoral College did.

America is supposed to be a free state, that is fair, but are we really? The Electoral College is one thing I can point out as unfair. Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system, that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate, but what if the people didn't want that candidate? Why should he get our way of speaking to the government? How are we even sure that he didn't elect himself? Also, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they will have a chance of winning because of basis. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

In reality, we all want our way, or our voice and or actions to make an impact, with the Electoral College that's not happening, which is making the people of our country unhappy with the government, which means we all can't get along. Most people prefer elections to be based on popular vote, so they know they get what they want, so they know they're actually making an impact.

With this being said, I believe I have made my impact on your thoughts of the question,"" to keep the Electoral College, or change election to popular vote?"". The Electoral College has both it's upsides, and it's downside, but I believe it has more flaws than perfections. Yes, it has been around for many decades and is a part of our history, maybe it worked then, but it's not working now. And we need to make a change before things get worse.

"I agree that the successful people will try to do new things rather than doing what they already know. If this not possible there may not any new inventions for defense ourselves in any case for e.g.; medicines, computers, hydrogen bomb sets., etc.

I do not agree with this statement because I think that there are many things that can be done that have not been invented yet. For example, there is a lot of work being done in the field of nanotechnology. There are also many other fields of science and technology that are still in their early stages of research and development. Therefore, it would be very difficult for a person to be successful in all of these fields at the same time.

What is the most important thing that you have learned in your life so far? I have learned that it is important to have a positive attitude and to believe in yourself and in what you are trying to achieve. It is also important not to give up when things don't work out the way you want them to.

"I agree that sport events such as the World Cup can help reduce the tension and bias between different countries and keep the peace of the world. The World Cup is a great example of how sport can be used to promote international cooperation and understanding.

The World Cup is a global sporting event that is held every four years. It is the biggest and most popular sporting event in the world. It is a competition between teams of national athletes. The competition is divided into several stages, and the final stage is a knockout tournament.

The World Cup has been used to promote international cooperation and understanding. For example, the World Cup has helped to improve relations between different countries. For example, relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran have improved because of the World Cup. The World Cup has also helped to improve relations between different religions. For example, relations between Muslims and Christians have improved because of the World Cup.

The World Cup has also been used to reduce the tension and bias between different countries.

" Limiting car usage has become an increasingly popular trend in recent years, as concerns about environmental sustainability, traffic congestion, and public health continue to grow. The passage set provides several examples of communities that have implemented policies to limit car usage, including Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogotá, Colombia.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of pollution, and reducing the number of cars on the road can have a significant impact on air quality. For example, in Paris, France, the city's ban on driving during periods of high pollution led to a significant reduction in smog and improved air quality. Similarly, in Bogotá, Colombia, the city's car-free day has led to a reduction in air pollution and improved public health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is a reduction in traffic congestion. Cars are a major source of traffic congestion, and reducing the number of cars on the road can help to alleviate this problem. For example, in Vauban, Germany, the community's car-free policy has led to reduced traffic congestion and improved public transportation. Similarly, in Bogotá, Colombia, the city's car-free day has led to a reduction in traffic congestion and improved public transportation.

A counterclaim to limiting car usage is that it can be inconvenient for individuals who rely on their cars for transportation. However, there are alternative transportation options available, such as public transportation, walking, and cycling. For example, in Paris, France, the city's ban on driving during periods of high pollution has led to an increase in the use of public transportation and cycling. Similarly, in Bogotá, Colombia, the city's car-free day has led to an increase in the use of public transportation and cycling.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a reduction in traffic congestion, and improved public health. While it may be inconvenient for individuals who rely on their cars for transportation, there are alternative transportation options available. By implementing policies to limit car usage, communities can improve the quality of life for their residents and contribute to a more sustainable future.",1,626
"I disagree with the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities have many benefits, forcing participation denies student choice and can overburden some. Instead of a mandate, the school should encourage involvement through offering diverse options and highlighting opportunities.

Many students already have packed schedules with academic responsibilities as well as family and personal obligations. Requiring additional commitments risks creating stress if it means taking on more than one is able to handle well. Not all extracurricular activities are a good fit personally or practically for each individual either. Forcing involvement removes student autonomy over how to spend free time. 

Rather than a mandate, a better approach is giving students more freedom to choose how to get involved, if at all. Presenting the wide array of options the school offers shows students the many potential benefits of extracurriculars without pressure. These may include opportunities to explore interests, enhance college applications, learn time management, relieve stress, and make new friends. Allowing choice respects that students have different strengths, priorities, and circumstances.

If some still do not wish to participate, that should be acceptable. Not all learn or benefit equally from group extracurricular activities. Individual students know themselves best and what environments allow them to achieve and feel engaged. Forcibly adding excessive commitments risks having the opposite effect intended and reducing well-being. 

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities provide valuable learning experiences, requiring universal participation is not fair to all students. The principal's goal of involvement is better achieved through promoting opportunities, not mandates that limit choice. Students will be more likely to buy in and reap maximum benefits from activities they select themselves based on their own needs and interests.",1,627
"This essay is going to be about why some people don't drive cars. In Vauban, Germany-Residents don't drive cars because it is a ""car-free"" zone They all sold a car to move here. Let me list some of the things that are

FORBIDDEN!

Street parking

Driveways and home garages

Now those are only two of the things that are

FORBIDDEN

, but let me remind you this is only an experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Car ownership is allowed, but only through the main gateway can you get to the car-owner. Also, this is where a man/woman (or couple) bought a space for $40,000, along with a home. As a result 70% of families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move here. Here are one of the statements form one of the residents who live here today.

""

When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Said a Hadron Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, was completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in troupe.

Here is another example of why cars are not good for... Well a lot of things that will take too much time to explain so I'm going to make this short and sweet.

Paris has banned driving due to smog. Smog is a smoke like substance if inhaled it will most likely kill you. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave there cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which in America is $31.00 and the same would apply to the odd number of license plates the following day. Let me tell you this almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters and some funny reactions to the fine are caught on camera 27 people acted out these incredulously funny acts and the look on their faces said that they were not happy, so now their cars are impounded.",0,628
"Title: **The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage: Learning from Vauban and Beyond**

In recent years, societies worldwide have begun to reconsider the pivotal role of the automobile, particularly in suburban regions. With various social and environmental challenges on the rise, the paradigm shift can be seen in areas like Vauban, Germany, where most residents have consciously decided to live without cars. This youthful and experimental community may likely be a blueprint of future suburbs, showcasing significant advantages of reducing car usage, which includes optimizing public health, lowering pollution levels and greenhouse gas emissions, and fostering sustainable and harmonious living environments.

Critically, Vauban’s “car-free” experience undeniably contributes to personal well-being. Residents of Vauban have found a relief from the tensions associated with car ownership and driving. This suburban lifestyle shift encourages walking and biking as the primary means of transportation, promoting physical activity and reducing stress levels (Rosenthal, para. 3).

Environmentally speaking, limiting our reliance on cars significantly assists in controlling pollution levels. Paris provides a stark example of the potential perils of car-dependence, as evident in its near-record pollution levels (Duffer, para. 10). Diesel emissions were attributed to causing an escalation in smog formation due to warm air trapping emissions from the densely populated automobiles on the streets. The situation became dire enough to necessitate a driving ban to clear the air (Duffer, para.11, 14-15). Simultaneously, cities like Bogotá, Colombia, have adopted a ""Day Without Cars,"" to promote alternative transportation and successfully reduce smog (Silky, para. 21). These instances illustrate how reducing automobile usage can significantly improve air quality and public health.

Moreover, by reducing car usage, we are also mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. As stated by Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for a sizeable percentage of greenhouse gas emissions (para. 5). Therefore, strategies aimed at reducing car usage could substantially cut down these emissions. 

Lastly, reducing car usage also cultivates societal benefits by fostering a sense of community and enhancing the livability of an area. In Vauban, the absence of cars has resulted in quieter, safer streets where children can freely roam, further enhancing the sense of community (Rosenthal, para. 3). Furthermore, it can lead to the creation of more green spaces, bicycle paths, and improved public infrastructure (Silky, para. 28). 

Nevertheless, it's vital to remember that limiting car usage doesn't equate to complete elimination. Instead, the idea is to promote smarter commuting choices like public transit, biking, carpooling, and walking. By adopting such practices, we can not only contribute to a healthier environment but also foster a more resilient, livable, and sustainable community.",1,629
"Zoos are like super cool places where we can see animals that we don't usually see in our daily lives. They're like a window into a whole different world. But some people think that zoos are bad and that we shouldn't have them anymore. I'm going to argue for zoos and why they're still important.

First, zoos are perfect for education. Like, have you ever seen a giraffe in person? They're huge! And they eat leaves off trees with their long necks. It's so cool! But if we didn't have zoos, a lot of people would never get to see that. We'd only see animals in pictures or videos, and it's not the same. Zoos let us see animals up close and personal, and it's a way better learning experience.

Another thing is that zoos help with conservation. They do breeding programs to help animals that are in danger of going extinct. Like, there's this really cool program where they're breeding pandas in captivity and then releasing them back into the wild. Without zoos, we might lose some really cool animals forever.

Also, zoos are super fun! They're like a big playground where we can see animals and learn about them at the same time. My little brother loves going to the zoo, and he's always asking me questions about the animals. It's a great way to spend time with family and learn something new.

But some people say that zoos are bad because animals are in cages, and it's not their natural habitat. I get that, but zoos are working to make the habitats more natural for the animals. They're like little ecosystems inside the zoo. And the animals are still way better off than if they were in the wild. In the wild, they have to worry about food and predators all the time. In the zoo, they don't have to worry about that stuff.

So, in conclusion, zoos are still important for education, conservation, and fun. They're not perfect, but they're working to get better. We should keep zoos around so that we can keep learning about and enjoying animals.",1,630
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the authors describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. It begins by the computer constructing a 3-D computer model of the face. If more than one muscle moves, then it is called an ""action unit."" I think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable.

There are times that in the classroom, students do not want to do their work and the teacher does not know how are they feeling about the work she is giving. That is when the teachers can find out what the students are feeling. The teacher can also use this program for assignments for the students.

The program is also useful for researching projects or assignments. Maybe the teacher wants the students to see if a picture of a certain person is happy or mad. The program is helpful because when you try it on yourself when you are mad or sad, it might actually make you day better.  ",0,631
"The schools offer is option that the students to attend classes from home by of online or video conferencing, but I think to the students is not benefit. Sometimes to the students not learned and this can to affect to the student with his learning. The teacher can to make a video conferencing, but they not know if the student to make all effort for learn.

The schools can offer is option, but the teachers not know if the students is learning the same this option has benefit, but also not has benefit because for a student is important to take his classes in home but for others not the put importance to the studio. For example: The school to get me the option of study in home I know that not learned and for me is better to study in the school because in home not would put soul the studio.

The teaching for online or video conferencing not to be the same is in the school that in a video conferencing or online because everything to be different we in the school can to ask help to a companion when we not understand some and to be a big help have somebody that us help in thing that we not understand. We have classes in home to remove the benefit of to meet to other people and also in online or video conferencing not the to show as to make an exposition in public for example: In a few works we're needing to pass to the front and explain the work, I think that the classes online will not teach us to not have pain talk in public but the school the teacher us to teach passing to the front for that us to lose the fear and the pain.

A few students to say ""Is better study in the school because have more benefit and us help more for the future also us to learn much thing as be sociable, respectful and also be a big person."" The school has much thing that to us the help in the school a few students to take in serious his studio but always a few students that not take in serious his studio sometimes only to go to school to trouble. I know that a few students to prefer study in online but I know that not to be the same because only would be watch the computer.

My opinion that the better option is study in the school because have more opportunity for that us learn and in the school have more benefit for us life and the option for the students to attend classes from home not is good because to remove much opportunity of to meet a new people. Always is better study in the school have much thing and also the school to we us to distract because so not think in us problems. In the school us effort for having a good future.  ",0,632

I believe this idea you are considering is an outrage! Many people now at days are complaining about how overweight children are. If you were to take away these opportunities, the students would most likely become even more obese because a large amount of the school has a C average. You should not eliminate these programs from our school day because kids look forward to them. Can you imagine coming to school for eight hours out of a twenty-four-hour day and doing nothing but work? Us kids would be brain-dead, beat! Some students actually enjoy school the way it is, but if you were to change that I doubt any child is going to be jumping out of bed happy to be going to school.

"Hey there! 

So, you know how sometimes we use our phones for, like, everything? Like, we use them to talk to our friends, to play games, to watch videos... and stuff. But have you ever thought about using our phones in school? Like, in the classroom? 

I know, I know, some of you might be thinking, ""Uh, no way! Phones in class? That's distracting!"" But hear me out. Using cell phones in the classroom can actually be really beneficial for both students and teachers. 

First, let's talk about students. Using phones in class can help us learn stuff better. Like, imagine you're studying for a history test, and you can look up pictures and videos of historical events on your phone. Or, if you're learning a new language, you can use your phone to practice pronunciation and vocabulary.  It's like having a little mini-computer in your pocket! 

And it's not just for learning stuff. Phones can also help us stay organized. Like, you can use your phone to keep track of your assignments and due dates, or to set reminders for when you have tests or projects.  Ooh, I got a reminder for my math test tomorrow! 

But it's not just about us students. Teachers can use phones in the classroom too!  They can use educational apps to teach us new things, or to make lessons more interactive. Like, they can use a math app to show us how to solve a problem, or a science app to show us pictures of different animals.  It's like having a little teaching tool right in their hands! 

Okay, so here's an example of when using phones in class would be super helpful.  Let's say we're learning about a new country in social studies. Instead of just reading about it in a book, we can use our phones to look at pictures and videos of the country. We",1,634

"Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to you as a constituent and active participant in our democracy to share my perspective on a matter of national concern: the continuance or dissolution of the Electoral College. The founders of our nation crafted the Electoral College as a compromise to ensure both direct individual contribution and representation at a state level (Paragraph 1, Text 1). Nonetheless, its relevance and efficacy have become subjects of intense debate, and I believe it is crucial that we preserve this system.

One predominant argument against the Electoral College is that it is not in line with the tenets of a direct democracy (Paragraph 14, Text 2). While this critique holds some truth, the function of the Electoral College extends beyond simple vote counting. It stratifies attention based on state engagements, forcing presidential candidates to appeal across regional lines (Paragraph 19, Text 3). A candidate with a broad trans-regional appeal is more likely to effectively serve the entire country as their policies must be inclusive of various regions, making the election process more democratic in a comprehensive sense.

The current system has been criticized for allowing a presidential candidate to lose the popular vote but win the presidency via electoral votes, as occurred in the 2000 election (Paragraph 9, Text 2). This scenario, though striking, is rare, and the Electoral College, in contrast, often lends clarity to electoral outcomes (Paragraph 18, Text 3). The ""winner-takes-all"" method, usually resulting in landslide victories within states and a more definitive outcome, reduces the likelihood of contested results.

Critics also argue that the Electoral College encourages candidates to strategically target ""swing states"", leaving certain areas inadequately represented (Paragraph 13, Text 2). However, all voters are equal stakeholders in our democracy, and their votes matter in shaping the final tally. Moreover, focusing on ""swing states"" encourages political engagement and thoughtful voting (Paragraph 20, Text 3).

Additionally, the Electoral College rectifies the political imbalance that large states suffer due to the Senate's mal-apportionment, ensuring they receive due attention from presidential candidates (Paragraph 21, Text 3). Finally, the Electoral College simplifies the electoral process, all but eliminating the need for run-off elections in instances where no candidate achieves the voting majority, providing a clear winner in each election cycle (Paragraph 22, Text 3).

While it is extremely important to voice criticisms of our electoral processes, it is equally crucial to understand the practical usefulness of the existing structures. Therefore, in light of the rationales listed above, I express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. I am confident that you will consider all perspectives in this discussion when forming your stance.

Sincerely,

"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. These examples include, less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. There is less stress because you are always tense as stated in the first source. There's cleaner air because cars are one of the leading causes to air pollution as said in source two. There's also more safety because streets don't have as much traffic stated on source three and four.

One benefit of limiting car usage is that there is less stress. There is less stress because when you own a car you may find yourself tense a lot of the time or maybe all the time. In source one, Medium Walter stated that she was always tense with a car, and now she is much happier. Bike riding and walking outside can be relieving without the sound of motors, hearing the children play in the park and breathing the fresh air is much better. In source three Carlos Arturo Plaza said that car free day is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This is another instance of someone supporting limiting car usage because there is less stress.

Cleaner air is another benefit to limiting car usage. Cars are one of the leading factors to air pollution, this is shown in source two. In source two, it states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France AFER five-days of intensifying smog. This proves that limiting car usage provides cleaner air for the environment. With cleaner air, there is a healthier population which is a benefit to limiting the usage of vehicles.

There is more safety with limiting car usage. If car usage is limited, then there aren't as many car accidents and there is less traffic. Less traffic could also lead to public transportation becoming more efficient and faster. The bus would be able to get to place much faster without other cars being in the way with would be a benefit to limiting car usage.

"Response to Policy Change

Dear principal,

I think that your Idea is great. I don't think students should be able to engage in after school activities, unless they earn it. Making them have to get a B or higher is what students need so they can set goals for themselves. This will make both the students and the parents of the students happy.

Having this system will make students try their hardest in the classrooms. I think that all schools should enforce this policy, so students can do better in life and pursue careers other than sports. Working harder in school will make the teachers and the parent of the student happy. Student may not like this rule at first, but later on they will be happy about the progress that they have made. This will then show them that they can do anything if they give it their best effort.

Another reason we should enforce this rule is because a student should be making at least a B average anyway. So this policy will get every kid involved in school. Doing this will make the student and the school look better. This rule is kind of like setting a goal for everyone in the school. I can understand a student being unhappy about this rule, but it will really help you become a successful adult.

The last reason is this; Why would any kid go to school and not try their hardest. You have to go to school anyway, so why not try your best. It is pointless to go to school if you don't try to get at least a B average. You will get nowhere in life if you don't try your best to succeed.

This rule is a great idea and I think it should have been enforced a long time ago. This will push kids to try their hardest in school which would make parents and teachers happy. I believe that any student can get a B average if they try hard. In order to play sports you have to earn it. This rule will make kids earn it and I think it should be enforced everywhere.

"The debate over whether children should learn to compete or cooperate has been ongoing for many years. While some people believe that competition is beneficial for children, others argue that cooperation is the better option. In my opinion, both competition and cooperation should be taught to children, as each has its own advantages.

Competition can be a great motivator for children. It encourages them to strive for excellence and to push themselves to achieve their goals. It also teaches them to be resilient and to accept failure as part of the learning process. Furthermore, competition can help children develop a sense of self-confidence and a competitive spirit. This can be beneficial in the long run, as it can help them succeed in their future endeavors.

On the other hand, cooperation is also an important skill for children to learn. It teaches them to work together and to respect the opinions of others. It also encourages them to be more open-minded and to think of creative solutions to problems. Cooperation can also help children develop better social skills, as it encourages them to be more understanding and tolerant of others.

In conclusion, both competition and cooperation should be taught to children. Competition can help children develop a sense of self-confidence and a competitive spirit, while cooperation can help them learn to work together and to respect the opinions of others. By teaching children both of these skills, they can become well-rounded individuals who are prepared to face the challenges of life.

" It is important for individuals to seek guidance from experts and authorities in order to make informed decisions and learn from their mistakes. People should not be afraid to ask for help, as it will ultimately lead to a better outcome.

Firstly, seeking guidance from experts can help individuals avoid making mistakes. For example, if someone is struggling with a particular subject, they can seek the help of a teacher or tutor who can explain the concepts in a way that is easy to understand. This can help the individual avoid making mistakes and improve their understanding of the subject.

Secondly, having someone to advise individuals can be especially helpful in situations where there are many options available. For example, when making a career decision, it can be helpful to speak with someone who has experience in that field and can provide insight into the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option.

Finally, seeking guidance from experts can also help individuals navigate the complexities of life. For example, in today's fast-paced world, it can be easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of information available.

"Driverless cars are not a good idea. The cars are too risky for us to be depending on. Relying on a computer that could easily mess up/lag out causing someone or something to get hurt does not sound like the best idea. The driverless cars are not always computer dependent, sometimes when there are bad traffic conditions the cars will have the driver take control of the wheel. The cars are not very cheap either, costing more than the average car because of the driverless cars extra ""perks,"" such as GPS, rearview camera, radar sensors, roof sensor, spinner sensor that creates a 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

In order to make these a possibility they have to convince the government to change the laws about driverless vehicles. In most states the vehicles are illegal and cannot be driven on roads because of fatality issues. They have to change the laws because if there is an accident, who gets the blame for the accident, the manufacturer or the person behind the wheel? This conflict is why most states have the law to protect their citizens from the hassle of deciding who to blame.

When the driverless car is in motion, it has many sensors to make sure that the car can drive safely to its destination. The car may also not be able to see a deer jumping out, or a kid running across the road quickly. The sensors wouldn't be able to know when a car is quickly whipping around a corner where the computer can not see. The car would be unaware of any unexpected interactions and that's not safe for us to have on our roads.

Driverless cars are not a good idea because they're not controlled by humans, and the computers aren't capable of avoiding wrecks, stopping for a car that ran a red light, a deer running out into the road, etc. We should not allow these cars to be sold, they're just too dangerous. We can not have accidents, and not know who to blame. ",0,643
"In today's society, the education system has become increasingly focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. While these subjects are undeniably important, there is a growing debate over whether students should be required to take a class in the arts or other electives. In my opinion, students should be required to take electives as it provides numerous benefits, such as promoting creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth.

First and foremost, taking electives allows students to explore their interests and passions. By taking a class in the arts or another subject that they enjoy, students are more likely to engage in the learning process and retain the information presented. This can lead to increased motivation and a more positive attitude towards learning. Additionally, electives provide students with an opportunity to discover new interests and hobbies that they may not have known about otherwise.

Furthermore, taking electives can help students develop important life skills that are not typically taught in STEM subjects. For example, taking a class in music or theater can help students develop communication skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. These skills are essential for success in both personal and professional life.

However, some argue that requiring students to take electives can lead to students not taking the subject seriously. This is a valid concern, but it can be mitigated through proper implementation. Teachers can make electives more engaging and relevant to students' interests by incorporating real-world examples and hands-on activities. Additionally, schools can provide incentives for students to take electives, such as recognition on their transcript or awards for outstanding performance.

Another argument against requiring electives is that it takes away from students' focus on STEM subjects. However, this argument is flawed. While STEM subjects are important, they are not the only subjects that matter. A well-rounded education should include a variety of subjects, including the arts and humanities. By taking electives, students can broaden their knowledge and develop a more holistic understanding of the world.

In conclusion, requiring students to take electives is a positive policy that provides numerous benefits, such as promoting creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth. While there are valid concerns about students not taking the subject seriously, these can be mitigated through proper implementation. Additionally, it is important to remember that a well-rounded education should",1,644
" Dear Senator [Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective system that ensures that every American's voice is heard.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is that it provides certainty of outcome. While it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election, this has only happened in a few instances throughout history. In contrast, a candidate who wins the Electoral College vote is almost certain to become President. This certainty of outcome is important because it allows candidates to focus their campaigns on the issues that matter most to voters, rather than simply trying to win over swing voters in key states.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This means that candidates must appeal to voters in multiple regions, rather than just focusing on their own region. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, rather than just a few key states. This is important because it ensures that the President is truly representative of the entire country, and not just a regional favorite.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus on swing states. This means that candidates must pay attention to the needs and concerns of voters in key swing states, rather than just focusing on their own base. This ensures that the President is elected by voters who are truly representative of the country, rather than just voters who are most likely to vote for a particular candidate.

In addition, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This means that larger states, which represent a larger portion of the population, have more influence in the election process. This is important because it ensures that the President is elected by voters who truly represent the entire country, rather than just voters in a few key states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This means that there is no need for run-off elections, which can be complicated and confusing. Instead, the Electoral College produces a clear winner, which is important for the stability of the country.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose, and avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of",1,645
"Have you ever had an opportunity to go to Europe and help people in need?

First, some reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program are, getting discovered. For example, if your 18 like I was you could be drafted for military service which means you would be able to help the world and have a great job. Another reason, you should join is because, you can discover some amazing things. For example, you could see places like Europe, china,Italy and Greece. Also, you will be helping a lot of people and animals because, you will be doing things for the benefit of there need. All of these examples show reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.

Next, but for me being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure.'' It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Just like it made me look at the world different it might be the same to you or even an achievement you have accomplished. There are some reasons you might be scared to go. For example, you might be scared of failing or being flown over board. But as long as you stay together with the person your with and do what you're supposed to your won't fail.

Another good reason of going to the seagoing cowboys program is helping people. World War 2 was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins and if you want to help all the people in ruins you could join the seagoing cowboys program. UNRWA hired the ''seagoing cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So from what the UNRWA said that means you probably would be getting paid. Even if you don't get paid It's still a good thing to do to help people that need help. All of these reasons state why this is a good reason to join the program.

In conclusion, all these reasons I have stated will really help people. Helping is what the seagoing cowboys program is about, and it will make you more aware of things like other countries in need. If your not 18 yet and you want to be drafted for military service join more than once because, the more you join, the more you're helping the people, animals,and environment. I hope from all the reasons I have given you, you'll join the seagoing cowboys program.  ",0,646
"Homework clubs for students.

Homework clubs are becoming increasingly popular among students as a way to improve their academic performance and develop important skills such as collaboration and communication. These clubs provide a supportive environment for students to work together on assignments, ask questions, and receive feedback from their peers and teachers.

One of the main benefits of homework clubs is that they can help students finish their assignments early. By working together in a group, students can divide the workload and complete tasks more efficiently. Additionally, group work can help students stay motivated and focused, as they can bounce ideas off each other and receive encouragement from their peers.

In my personal experience, I have struggled with getting homework done on my own. Sometimes I would procrastinate and leave my assignments until the last minute, which would result in rushed work and a lower quality final product. However, when I joined a homework club, I found that working with my peers made the process much more enjoyable and manageable.

Collaboration between students can also help improve a student's understanding of the material. By discussing concepts with their peers, students can gain new perspectives and clarify any confusion they may have. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject and better performance on assignments.

Furthermore, homework clubs can help improve a student's communication skills. By discussing ideas and working together on assignments, students must communicate effectively with their peers and teachers. This can help them develop important interpersonal skills that will serve them well in the future.

In conclusion, homework clubs offer numerous benefits for students. They can help students finish their assignments early, improve their understanding of the material, and develop important skills such as collaboration and communication. By joining a homework club, students can set themselves up for success in their academic pursuits and beyond.",1,647

If you like helping people the Seagoing Cowboys program because what they would do is that during World War II they would give some counties that were in World War II food, supplies, animals, and more.

If you want to know the name of the group it is UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). I know it is long and hard to remember but if you join for your free time you can travel to cool places around the world. The best part is that 44 nations will join.

Another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program if you like animals you should go became the UNRWA will be sending animals overseas on a boat to counties that are overseas. Second is you want to make friends when you there cause are going to have a lot of people that you can make friends with.

"Hey there!  So, you want to know about the benefits of singing?  Well, let me tell you, it's like, totally awesome! 

First, singing can make you feel super happy and relaxed. Like, have you ever been in a bad mood and then started singing your favorite song? Boom! Instant mood boost!  It's like this magic thing that can turn frowns upside down. And it's not just because of the catchy tunes, but also because of the endorphins that get released when you sing. Endorphins are like, the happy hormones in your body, and they can help reduce stress and anxiety. 

I know, right? It's like, science-y!  But it's not just science, it's also personal experience. Like, I was feeling really stressed out last week because of a big test, and then I started singing my favorite song in the shower.  And suddenly, I felt so much better! It was like, my worries just melted away with the melody. 

And it's not just for when you're feeling stressed or sad. Singing can also be a great way to relieve boredom!  Like, when you're stuck in traffic or on a long car ride, you can sing to pass the time. Or, if you're at a party, and you don't know how to dance, you can sing along to the music!  It's like, a universal language that can bring people together. 

So, there you have it! Singing is like, the best thing ever!  It can make you feel happier, relieve stress, and even pass the time.  So, go ahead, grab a mic, and belt out your favorite tune! Your body (and your friends) will thank you! 

Oh, and one more thing!  Did you know that singing can also improve your breathing and posture? Like,",1,649
" Dear State Senator,

I am writing to you today to discuss the importance of the Electoral College in our voting system for the President of the United States. While the College has come under scrutiny in recent years, I believe it is an essential part of our democracy and should be preserved.

The Electoral College was established as a compromise between the election of the President by popular vote and the appointment of the President by the Congress. It serves as a vital check on the power of the majority and ensures that all voices are heard in our democracy. Without the Electoral College, candidates would only need to focus on large cities and populous states to win elections, neglecting the needs and concerns of smaller states and rural communities.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to expand their outreach and build coalitions across different regions and demographics. This is exemplified by the fact that the winning candidate in the popular vote has not always won the election. In fact, this has happened four times in our country's history: Andrew Jackson in 1824, Samuel Tilde in 1876, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Without the Electoral College, candidates would have little incentive to appeal to a broad base of voters, potentially leading to a lack of representation for some communities.

Some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic as it can override the popular vote. However, this is not a valid argument as the Electoral College has always been a part of our democratic process. Furthermore, the Electoral College is not a random collection of representatives, but rather a group of elected officials who are accountable to their constituents. Any attempt to change the system would require a constitutional amendment, demonstrating the complexity and significance of such a change.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an essential component of our democracy that ensures the voices of all Americans are heard in the election of the President. It encourages candidates to build broad coalitions and represents the interests of all communities, regardless of size or location. I hope you will consider these arguments and work to preserve the Electoral College as an integral part of our democratic system.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,650
"Dear Mr. Principal

This letter is to inform you in what position I take in this community service act your planing to dump on all the students. Personally I think it's wrong to force these kids to perform community service. There are students that don't want to perform community service and I say don't make those students do it! For the students that actually want to perform community service I suggest that the school work with them and help them clean up a little. Maybe even reward them perhaps with a free one hundred or whatever you may have in mind. Don't you think that sounds a little more reasonable, Mr. Principal? For example, its three pm the students are just getting out of school to go clean the sides of the street. A student has three assignments he needs to complete before the end of tomorrow, but he's stuck here cleaning until six-thirty pm and by the time he gets home its seven already and his parents tell him it's time to start getting ready for bed. Now the student has three incomplete assignments that's three zeros and could cause him to fail for the six weeks, and it's all because he had to perform community service. Just think, all the parents and conference meetings you will have to go through because of angry parents. Mr. Principal, please don't force our students into doing community service. We have enough things to worry about as it is. The kids who want to clean, they can clean. I hope I changed your mind Mr. Principal.

"Emotions and being able to recognize them when they occur have a lot to do with our human ability to learn and pick up information. If perhaps, one is feeling confused, it would be much harder for them to be able to retain information being thrown at them. We see this a lot in the educational environment. At school, students must be attentive and ready to learn before they are actually able to start the process of learning. This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that schools, as well as the education system should pay more attention to students' emotions towards subjects, contrasting enthusiasm to pick up a new idea with boredom followed by inability to focus. This being said, the new software being used to detect emotion from facial expressions could be a rather helpful tool in the everyday classroom for years to come.

Every student has a different set of feelings, all are complex creatures with opinions on subjects that could differentiate them from one another. Some are better at learning subjects they are more interested in while others have the ability to devote time into learning any subject that school has to throw at them. The point remaining is that none are the same and so, teaching methods for students should become more individualized to fit each student unique learning style and ability. It is possible that the computerized Facial Action Coding System could aid in the process of making these learning styles more fit for each student rather than just having them for the masses. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts, 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Having a computer monitor to read emotions from facial expressions could display to teachers how each student reacts to the information that they are learning, allowing teachers to make adjustments in their teaching styles where they see fit. This could give students the ability to learn more effectively for their feelings towards subjects as they are personalized based on reaction as they continue.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a very complex process consisting not only of computer scientists but also of a team of psychologists using expertise to read peoples' emotions through their faces, using scientific evidence along the way. This could mean that, while it is a newer system, it is a well-proven one, making the classroom a good place to continue perfecting it. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Monday Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This line from the informative piece displays the process of determining emotions through computer technologies. It shows that it is well-tested and understood by its administrators as well as those in support of it, gaining it credibility as a method tested and used. This means that, while it is a newer technology, it could be used in the classrooms to continue to perfect the software by gaining more facial expressions from students, making it even more effective for its participants.

While the software detecting facial expressions is a good idea for countless reasons, it also has a few downfalls. One disadvantage of this technology could be its lack of other uses besides reading emotions of students as far as classrooms go. Some may argue that installation of this likely pricey software would not be worth the pay or the hassle of overall installation. To this, one could argue that allowing students to have a more personalized approach to learning should be enough to convince those against it that it is worthwhile. Students being able to learn in an environment as well as manner specifically tailored to their individual learning abilities and styles will benefit us as a society not only in the future, as today's current students become tomorrow's important business officials and doctors, but also currently, as these students will have less stress devoted to worrying about trying to learn something they are disinterested in or simply don't understand. Altogether, the good outweigh the bad in this current argument.

Computerized systems used to understand and display human emotions do belong in today's classroom. The benefits of this approach are numerous for both teachers and students being effected as well as for the future when these students are more outspoken, functioning members of society. This can be displayed that, not only would these systems help students to become more able and excited to learn in their own way, but it would also allow teachers to more effectively complete their jobs by editing approaches to learning to fit each student's individual style and ability. It is also a well-understood and well backed-up process with scientific study allowing direct research to show its credibility. Having students using this technology could also allow for the technology to become more credible as more emotions of individuals are entered into the technology. Finally, the price of these systems would not matter in the long-run as this would be money invested into the future of society as these students grow with a solid, quality education. Altogether, the good outweigh all the downfalls in this experiment, and it should be introduced into classrooms in the following years to improve the quality of education.  ",0,652
"Successful people are often perceived as those who have achieved a certain level of success due to their hard work, dedication, and ability to overcome challenges. It is widely accepted that successful people are those who have learned to do what they do best, and have done it'so well that it has resulted in success. However, this is not the only factor that contributes to success.

Successful people understand the importance of trying new things and taking risks in order to achieve greater success. By embracing novelty and taking risks, successful people are able to expand their knowledge and experience, develop new skills, and explore new opportunities. This not only leads to greater success but also allows them to explore their potential and discover new paths to success.

For example, Steve Jobs was a highly successful entrepreneur who is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the modern age. Despite already having achieved success with Apple, Jobs did not stop there. He went on to take risks and try new things, such as launching the ill-fated Next computer and Pixar Animation Studios. Although these ventures did not initially lead to success, they eventually proved to be highly successful and led to further success for Jobs.

Taking risks and trying new things is also important for successful people because it allows them to stay ahead of the competition. By exploring new opportunities, successful people can gain a competitive edge that can help them stay ahead of their rivals and ensure continued success.

Finally, taking risks and trying new things can open up a world of possibilities for successful people. By embracing new challenges, successful people can explore new avenues of success and discover new ways of achieving greater success.

In conclusion, successful people understand the importance of taking risks and trying new things in order to achieve greater success. By taking risks and trying new things, successful people can expand their knowledge and experience, develop new skills, and explore new opportunities. This not only leads to greater success but also allows them to stay ahead of the competition and open up a world of possibilities.

"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" I am against the cars, because the car doesn't seem driverless if you still someone in the driver seat and at times you also still have to control the car. I feel as if, it was to be driverless no one would need to be included in the driver seat, unless the car is needed to be parked into a store parking lot and if it was so driverless it still wouldn't need anyone to park the car into a parking lot. I feel as if Google, wanted better votes on the car they should out a little more effort into getting it to become more of a driverless car, without needing anyone to be in the driver seat or worrying about getting into any wreaks.

Furthermore, I would probably agree with the car if they knew who to blame a break on. Because, if your not in control of the car and just so happens the car starts to get out of control when you tried to turn the heat on but pressed the wrong button by accident. Is it the car owners fault or is it the manufacture fault for having another button by the heat and air conditioner? I feel as if the car would be safer if driverless cars had there a special road built for them, but the cost of that would be an over then a million dollars. I would agree with the driverless cars if thy had a road built just for the’m to drive on.

More reasons to why I don't agree with the driverless car is because, the car should be able to navigate its self through roadworks, and they didn't really give much detail into the car and it not being able to function with the road work, baking out of driveways and accidents. The article didn't explain much about the car itself, does the car take gas or will it be an electrical car.

I feel as if the car was to be electrical it would probably get more votes than what the car is getting now. I feel as if the car should be updated in many ways as in being able to drive no matter the condition of the road. The article also didn't include if the car could drive through any type of weather. If the car was to slide on ice and crash into a pole who's fault it is the car owners fault or man factors fault?

Positive things about the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is that the cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Another thing is that in article it tells the reader about without the option of smarter roads, manufacture turned to smarter cars. I feel as both could have happened in a way and I feel that if we have smarter roads, manufacture wouldn't really have to worry about accidents happening or have to worry about the driver int eh car taking over in cause of a tight situation.

I feel the car would be a success because of the sensors the car has, I feel that with sensor on the car manufacture wouldn't have to worry about the car getting into wreaks, and I feel as if the car would be able to drive through roads that are being worked on. Another positive thing about the driverless cars is that they are willing to make new laws for the car.",0,655

"Dear senator,

I believe that Electoral college is unfair in many ways, and maybe it would be good to keep the election by popular vote for the United States. The reasons why changing the election to Electoral college would be; smaller states would not see the mandates because they would go to the bigger states like California, Texas and other states that are bigger than Ohio or South Carolina some of these states didn't even see a campaign ad how sad is that because this country is known for the squatness off every one but yet the electoral college forgets about seventeen states that are small because their vote doesn't matter.?

Keeping the election by popular vote would be the best. The fact that the people of the United States are able to see and vote for whom they prefer not the electors who elect the president. You might think that keeping the electoral college election is not as bad or unfair because it can help elect a president when the one of the presidents vote are majority of vote it can help a run-off election but I have the best way to select the president of the U.S. would be by letting the people choose what they think is the best, so the people know they are noticed in this country.",0,657

"Men are like ants. We are always in a rush and always desperate to arrive on time. The easiest way to arrive on time in any place, is by car. Cars, however, tend to do a lot more bad than they do good. Cars release large amounts of pollution and can raise smog and noise levels in areas where there is a lot of driving. Smog and pollution isn't very good for anybody, so some areas have taken preventative steps to keep Earth healthy and to keep people healthy as well. The shocking part is, the cars get cut out.

In some areas, like the experimental Vauban in Germany, cars are not allowed at all. No honking is heard when the sun rises, and streets are oddly empty. Shops are lined up within walking distance, and few buses run to allow for people to travel a little quicker. In fact, 70% of Vaughn's population do not own cars, and many sold their cars for a chance to live in Vauban. The streets are safer, and people seem to be a lot less tense about things, when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Hadron, an occupant of Vauban. Vauban has proved that removing the car entirely can help to calm people, and even redesign the way cities and homes work to provide safer, cleaner areas for man to live in.

Cars can need to be removed for more negative reason as well. Paris, France, had sever issues with the amount of smog in the city. Smog can be incredibly dangerous, making large chances of acid rain and possible issues with breathing. France has had one of the largest amounts of smog when compared to many other cities, usually only beat by Beijing, which in one of the most polluted areas. France knew, however, that the city could not possibly handle having every car taken away in a night, so they attempted to cut a half off for each day. For a week, fines were placed on cars with license plates that ended in either an even or odd number, the taxes applied more specifically to which license plates would be tagged, odd on one day, even the next. The large fines did not persuade everyone, however, and 4,000 drivers were still fined. The week of cutting down cars, however, proved to work very well and cut down on the amount of smog quickly and carefully so that everyone would have a safer and cleaner Paris.

In Bogotá, Columbia, the removal of cars is celebrated as if it were a holiday. Each year on one day everyone will refrain from driving to skateboard, bike, walk, hike, or any number of modes of transportation to prevent the usage of cars. The city does this not only as a fun way to promote an eco-friendly Bogotá, but to cut down on its own smog issues. Like any capital of any country, there's a lot of movement, and with movement comes cars, and with cars: smog. Their event has even inspired many other cities and countries to do the same thing, continuously aiding in the fight against global warning.

Even America, the gas guzzling, NASCAR approving, road rage warriors of the world, try to cut down on car usage. The issue has even reached the President. America has found that slowly but surely that men and women are slowly moving away from the car as a mode of transportation. Since 2005, car usage has dropped tremendously in favor of public transportation like trams and buses.",0,659
"Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite Risks

The author makes a compelling case that exploring Venus remains a worthy scientific pursuit in spite of the planet's hazardous conditions. While Venus presents clear dangers to potential explorers and equipment, the article outlines several key ways in which valuable scientific insights could still be gained from Venus exploration. 

To begin, the author notes the many unanswered questions that continue to motivate further Venus study. Exactly how, and why did Venus evolve into an inhospitable planet with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead? Understanding Venus' transition could provide lessons about climate change and planetary evolution. The article also suggests Venus may harbor clues about the early history of Earth and other terrestrial planets. With its similar size and mass to our own, studying Venus may reveal much about Earth's pre-atmospheric state.

In addition, the author proposes several exploration strategies and technologies that could help mitigate risks on Venus. For example, future landers or orbiting craft may deploy hemostat balloons or aircraft to examine the Venusian atmosphere from elevations with more moderate temperatures. The article also highlights how cutting-edge materials, cooling techniques and autonomous systems could help probes withstand Venus' brutal environment much longer to achieve meaningful scientific objectives. While challenges certainly remain, these innovative approaches offer pathways to safely accessing more of the Venusian atmosphere and surface for research. 

In sum, while Venus poses very real threats, the author presents a persuasive argument that its study remains scientifically important and potentially feasible with further technological progress. Even in a hazardous environment, much could still be learned about geological and atmospheric evolution from our nearest planetary neighbor. For these reasons, the pursuit of Venus exploration as outlined deserves continued support and investment despite the dangers involved. The author makes a valid case that the scientific rewards could outweigh the risks for expanding our understanding of basic planetary processes.",1,660

The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer relevant to our current political system. It was created in a time when the United States was a much smaller country, and when communication and transportation were much slower. In those days, it made sense to have a system in which each state had a certain number of electors, regardless of its population. However, that is no longer the case. Today, the United States is a much larger and more diverse country, and the Electoral College system no longer reflects the will of the people.

In fact, the Electoral College has often led to presidents being elected who did not win the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In that election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president. This is a clear example of how the Electoral College system is not fair or representative of the will of the people.

There are several reasons why I believe that the president should be elected by popular vote. First, it would be the fairest way to choose the president. In a popular vote system, every vote would count equally. This is not the case under the current system, where voters in some states have more power than voters in other states.

Second, a popular vote system would be more democratic. The United States is a democracy, and the people should have the right to choose their leaders. Under the current system, the people do not have this right. The Electoral College gives more power to a few people, the electors, who are not accountable to the people.

Third, a popular vote system would be more efficient. The Electoral College system is a complicated and outdated system that is no longer necessary. A popular vote system would be much simpler and easier to understand.

I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote. This is the best way to ensure that the president is elected by the will of the people.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,661
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the impact of technology on human contact as an average 8th grade student:

Technology has changed the way we interact with each other in so many ways. It's like, we used to have to actually talk to each other face-to-face to communicate, but now we can just send a text or a snap or an email and be like, ""Hey, what's up?"" And it's like, totally fine. But sometimes I think it's kinda weird that we don't have to actually see each other's faces or hear each other's voices to talk to each other.

On the positive side, technology has made it way easier to stay in touch with our friends who live far away. Like, my best friend moved to California last year and I only see her like, once a year, but we can still talk on Snapchat and Instagram and stuff. And it's like, totally fun to see each other's updates and stuff. And also, technology has made it way easier to make new friends. Like, I met this one girl in my class who moved here from Japan, and we became best friends because we could talk on our phones during lunch and stuff.

But on the negative side, technology can be kinda lonely sometimes. Like, I'll be hanging out with my friends in real life, and we'll all be on our phones and stuff, and it's like, we're not really talking to each other. And also, technology can make it harder to communicate face-to-face. Like, my family will be sitting in the living room watching TV, and we'll all be on our phones and stuff, and it's like, we're not really talking to each other.

And also, technology can be really distracting. Like, I'll be trying to do my homework, but then I'll see something funny on my phone, and I'll get distracted and forget what I was doing. And it's like, totally frustrating. But sometimes I think it's just like, a part of life now.

So overall, I think technology has both positive and negative impacts on human contact. It's like, it makes it easier to stay",1,662
"Did you know that one out of every four schools don't let students participate in extracurricular activities? I believe that this is unfair and students should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Imagine not being able to participate in many fun skill-learning activities.

While others believe that participating in an extracurricular activity is a waste of time, I believe that it is not.

I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as, it will make school a better place for students to be in, it will be a chance for students to make more friends or meet new people and kids will improve their skills or learn new skills.

Extracurricular activities will make school a better place for students to attend. It will also encourage kids to want to go to school every day because they will be looking forward to that one or more extracurricular activity. Many kids don't want to attend school every day because they have so many things going on like homework, projects, tests etc. Extracurricular activities will help relief the stress many kids go through every day, it will get their mind off all the things going on at home. When I was having a bad day at school, I always remembered that I was going to stay after school for Art club that day and that cheered me up.

Extracurricular activities will also be the chance for students to make friends and meet new people. It is most likely the kids you meet in that extracurricular activity will be interested in the same thing as you are. For example if you meet someone that likes and plays the same sport as you, you guys will have something in common. One time I attended the Spanish Culture club and I met a lot of new people that I had in common with, everyone spoke Spanish and was from South America.

Extracurricular activities will improve kids skills or teach them new skills. It is good for a kid to know many skills because it will help them later in life, it doesn't hurt to learn new skills or to improve them. When I joined my school's dance team I learned a lot of new skills, for example turns, jumps, new choreography etc. I also improved how flexible I was and how far I could do my splits. By the end of the school year I learned how to properly do my splits and also some jumps. Joining the dance team really helped me in a lot of ways.

In conclusion, I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as it will make school a better environment and a better place in general, it will be a chance for students to make more friends and meet more people and kids will improve some previous skills they have, or they will learn new skills. ",0,663
"Do you ever wonder what life today would be like if we didn't have cars? Not having a car today wouldn't be such a bad thing. Maybe the economy would get better because we would have to pay for fuel. The advantages of limiting your car usage is it could lower the rate of global warming and people around the works wouldn't have to pay for parking or tolls to get somewhere.

The first advantage to limiting your car usage is to lower the rate of global warming. Cars today are the main source of global warming. Source two says ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of smog..."", This is what happens when the is too much smog in the city and people can't drive around because they can't see where they are going. In Europe, the United States, and other places are starting movement called ""smart planning"" where they separate suburban life from auto use. Source one states ""And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions..."". That right there proves that the use of cars and fuel are a big part of global warming and that we should limit car usage.

The second advantage to limiting car usage is that we wouldn't have to pay for parking anymore, and we wouldn't have to pay for tolls. Citizens probably pay millions of dollars every day for parking and tolls. Source one says ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the age of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" Citizens shouldn't have to pay that much for a parking space and that's just in Vauban, Germany. What if every country state red doing that? Then the economy would really be bad.

In the end, there aren't very many advantages to limiting car usage but the advantage of lowering the rate of global warming and not paying parking or tolls is a good start and maybe if we start with something small like that we can conquer something bigger later on and not use car at all.  ",0,664

"Title: My Dream of Becoming a Professional Soccer Player

As an 8th grader, I have always been passionate about soccer. I have been playing the sport since I was 5 years old and have never lost my love for it. My dream is to become a professional soccer player, and I know that it will take hard work and dedication to achieve this goal.

Becoming a professional soccer player is important to me because it would allow me to pursue my passion while also providing financial stability and the opportunity to travel the world. I have always been fascinated by the idea of playing in front of thousands of fans and representing my country or club on the biggest stages. The thought of living and breathing soccer every day is exhilarating, and I know that it would bring me immense joy and fulfillment.

There are many examples of people who have achieved their dreams of becoming professional athletes. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are two of the most successful soccer players of all time, and they both started playing at a young age and worked tirelessly to develop their skills. Their dedication and perseverance are inspiring, and they prove that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.

However, there are also examples of people who have not achieved their dreams. For example, some talented athletes may not have had the same opportunities as others due to factors such as poverty or lack of access to resources. This highlights the importance of equality and fairness in sports, as everyone should have the chance to pursue their dreams regardless of their background.

When it comes to achieving my dream, I know that I will need to work hard and stay focused. This means training every day, attending camps and clinics, and constantly improving my skills. I will also need to be open to feedback and criticism, as this will help me to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, I will need to be mentally tough and resilient, as setbacks and failures are inevitable in any sport.

Another important aspect of achieving my dream is learning how to trust myself. This means believing in my abilities and making decisions that align with my values and goals. It also means taking risks and being willing to take calculated",1,666
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think the idea of having a principal making everyone in the school have to do community service is good, but I could be troubling for some people. There has to be a lot of thought put into making this decision, from the person making the decision and their point of view on it to the people that are going to be affected once the decision is made. All this will have to be thought out taking into consideration the type of community service that is going to be required to do.

Different types of community service require certain skills, transportation, and even tools. Helping out at a retirement home is a good way of showing your community support and that you care about all the people in your community but having the transportation to get to where you need to go in order to be able to help out can be a problem. Many of the kids in the school that will be participating in this event cannot drive on their own, they are brought to and from places by their parents. As willingly as this students maybe about helping out, their parents/guardian may not have the time to take them where they need to go. Parents are very busy, not only with their kids, but with work, and adding another thing for them to worry about might not be good. This could also get in the way of their schedule, but this isn't something that has to be done every day, once a week, is better than nothing.

Community service is good in many ways. If students at a young age grow up with the act of helping others around them, they will keep that with them for the rest of their life. Growing up helping people with small acts of kindness as simple as getting an elder person a glass of water, helping someone put in groceries, helping out serve food at a homeless shelter will make you a better person inside and out. By helping out others around you with small things can bring big rewards later on.

Other acts that can be done that are simpler, things such as picking up a piece of trash that you see on the floor on your way home. Helping out your little cousin, or neighbor with his/her homework. This acts as little as they may seem will make a difference in the end.

I think that the idea of having everyone participate in community service is great. Some kids might have difficulties with transportation, but minor problems like that can be solved as simply as carpooling with a neighbor or friend, riding a bike which is even better because it helps out the environment, or even walking. And, all these small things that you might have to sacrifice for it, like watching a movie with your friends will be worth it in the end.",0,667
"The ability to be able to read students emotions can be helpful and cool, but it can also be redundant. The ability of being able to see what emotions of others is something that occurs in us almost naturally, but being able to tell exactly how someone feels about something can help people such as psychologists or teachers extremely. Being able to see what students think about a lesson or about a video they are watching in school can be quite helpful.

If a teacher or some type of educated is able to receive information about how someone feels, it could help the teacher see if the student actually enjoys the lesson or is at least interested in it. The ability of being able to tell how a student is thinking could change the way of how figuring out emotional information about the student and help the teachers improve on their work and teachings. But this technology could be creepy for some users. The ability to know if a person likes an add off of a website also means that their face is being displayed for someone or something to see it. A lot of people won't like that idea or not like the ability of doing so to be right or normal.

The ability of being able to see how people are thinking with technology may help in some situations. But the human mind is already programmed to tell these certain characteristics about other people, so the use of using technology to help could be quite redundant. Teachers are able to tell of a student isn't enjoying a lesson if the student is either sleeping, yawning, or looking bored. The use of technology to show human emotions can help in some ways for people, but it's not worth using technology for.",0,668
"Often times, we find ourselves self-imposing limitations in areas of our lives where we feel we do not excel, or where we are uncomfortable. This can be detrimental to our own personal growth, both professionally and personally. Dissatisfaction is natural and healthy, as it often encourages us to strive for more and become better versions of ourselves, however it can also be dangerous if taken too far. It is wise to endeavor to constantly learn new things and strive further than our current capabilities -- continually striving for more can help us become more confident, rounded individuals. This is reflected in Emerson's statement that ""we should always be going after growth,"" as people are constantly gaining knowledge and pushing boundaries to reach some semblance of harmony in their lives. There is much to be said for widening one's perspective and expanding our knowledge.",1,669
"There is no doubt that educating girls has a ripple effect that extends far beyond the individual girl herself. When a girl is given the opportunity to learn and grow, she brings her family and community along with her.

Educating girls has a number of tangible benefits for families and communities. For example, girls who are educated are more likely to marry later and have fewer children. They are also more likely to earn a higher income, which allows them to contribute more to their families and communities. In addition, educated girls are more likely to be involved in their communities, working to improve the lives of those around them.

Educating girls also has a number of intangible benefits. When girls are educated, they are more likely to challenge traditional gender roles. This can lead to a more equitable society in which both men and women are given the opportunity to participate fully in all aspects of life.

Ultimately, educating girls is one of the most effective ways to improve the lives of families and communities. By giving girls the opportunity to learn, we are giving them the chance to create a better future for themselves and for those around them.

"The arts of technology. I think it is safe to say that technology has expanded over time. We live in a world where kids and even adults have technology. It is a part of our society now, but remember how hundreds of years ago we did not have technology, and we did just fine? How we showed emotions through tour and nothing else and now days we have emoticons and what not?

Now we have a computer that reads us. How weird is that? We did not need this, but now we seem to have. Kids now days email their teacher in order to get help when not so long ago we had Saturday school to tutor those that needed help. This computer is going to help teacher supposedly read the face expression children make has they are explaining the lesson. That way they can go back and see who makes expression of confusion and does not.

This will help those kids that are too afraid to say the need help. See a children ego can be pretty big when it comes to their education believe it or not. A kid could be too afraid to ask for help because they have a feeling they can do it on their own. The computer target each motion the face makes or when ever a muscle is different or changes in a face. A teacher/student relationship is now going to follow up by a computer screen. Won't be long until the robots take over.

This computer program will probably make it easy for other people to see how they feel towards one another. Maybe some will like the answer and others will not. See thing about this is that maybe the computer will direct a feeling that the person will not be sharing at all or does not want people to know about this feeling. It could be invade some privacy because this person might be adding a feeling that do not want show, This computer will read that due to the face muscles he/she will be moving. Whoever reads the results of this person will find themselves in a position they will not know what to do.

Maybe this computer program is good for something's, but in some occasions it will not be a good source. Also, this computer program alternates more the usage of technology these days. This will make society more intense and more into technology than what it already is. People should be able to show and tell their emotions if they feel free to. Not by a computer to tell them for them!",0,671
"Dear, State Senator

The Electoral College is a great process that was created by the founding fathers in the Constitution."" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The electoral college consists of the electors the meeting of the electors of the voting for president and vice president. The electoral college process consists of 538 electors. When you run for president you have to get the majority of the 270 electoral votes its required. Every candidate running for president has their own group of electors."" Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" The electors are chosen by the candidate's political party.

When the presidential election is over your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment its listing all the candidates who had run for president in your state. The certificate also says the winning presidential candidate in your state."" After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing all the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors."" The states certificate of ascertainment are sent to the congress and the national archives.

The electoral college should be keeping the electoral college because it's a very important process of how we choose the president. If we just put our say in the votes some people might feellike they made the wrong choose in the voting. And if we just let congress pick our president because that's not fair because this is our country too ADN we should have a say about what the present going to do or what are some of he/she plans to do for our county.""the electoral college is widely regarded as and anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled]by declaring THT candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.""

There five reasons to keep the electoral college certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states and lastly avoid run-off elections. It is possible for a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote."" The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the popular vote."" A presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" This is a desirable result appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"". The electoral college restores some weight in the balance the large states lose by virtue.

In Conclusion the electoral college should stay became it makes everything fair for the electoral candies and so citizen of the United States have a chance to have a say in what they want as a president.",0,672
"The debate over whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has been ongoing for many years. While both approaches have their merits, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate.

Cooperation is an essential life skill that can help children develop important social and emotional skills. Working together with others can help children learn how to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, and build relationships. It also teaches them the importance of compromise and understanding different perspectives. For example, when children work together on a project, they must learn to listen to each other’s ideas and find a way to combine them into a unified solution. This type of collaboration can help children learn how to work with others and develop a sense of empathy.

In addition, cooperation can help children become more creative and innovative. When children work together, they can brainstorm ideas and come up with solutions that they may not have thought of on their own. This type of creative problem-solving can help children develop critical thinking skills and become more confident in their abilities.

Competition can also be beneficial for children, as it can help them develop a sense of self-confidence and a drive to succeed. However, it can also lead to feelings of frustration and anxiety, especially if children are not successful. Furthermore, competition can lead to a sense of rivalry and animosity between children, which can be damaging to their relationships.

In conclusion, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. Cooperation can help children develop important social and emotional skills, become more creative and innovative, and build strong relationships with their peers.

"As societies become more complex and competitive, the debate over whether children should learn to compete or cooperate has become increasingly relevant. While some people believe that competition is the best way to prepare children for the real world, others argue that cooperation is essential for success in today's interconnected world. In my opinion, both are important, but cooperation should be emphasized over competition.

Firstly, cooperation is necessary for success in many areas of life, including the workplace. Today's businesses operate in a globalized and interconnected world, and success often depends on the ability to work effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. Therefore, children need to learn how to work collaboratively with others and appreciate the value of teamwork. This can be fostered through group projects, team sports, and other activities that require cooperation.

Secondly, emphasizing competition can be detrimental to children's mental health and well-being. When children are constantly pitted against one another, it can lead to stress, anxiety, and a fear of failure. This can have long-term consequences, including decreased motivation and self-esteem. By contrast, when children learn to cooperate and work together, they can experience a sense of belonging and mutual support that can be beneficial for their mental health.

Lastly, cooperation can also promote empathy and kindness. When children are taught to work together, they learn to appreciate the perspective and needs of others. This can lead to the development of empathy, which is a critical skill for building positive relationships with others. In addition, when children learn to cooperate, they are more likely to engage in acts of kindness and service to others, which can help them develop a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

In conclusion, while competition has its place in certain contexts, cooperation should be emphasized over competition when it comes to children's development. Cooperation is essential for success in today's interconnected world, and it can also promote mental health, empathy, and kindness. Therefore, parents and educators should prioritize activities that foster collaboration and teamwork, rather than solely focusing on competition.

"In 1976, a single image of Mars taken by a NASA spacecraft blew the world's mind. It depicted a gigantic face on Mars. Of course, we understood that people would be shocked. In fact, we told the public that it was only a natural formation, and the conspiracy theorists came along with their new story. They accused us of hiding the fact that there was an alien civilization on the Red Planet, and that the picture is a monument. All we want to do here at NASA is inform skeptics that they are severely mistaken.

First, we revealed the information because we wanted the public to be informed, and we wanted to not hide anything. All the skeptics should stop and realize that us revealing partial information is just illogical. If we revealed the picture, it's because we wanted people to know about it. As we said earlier, the face-type shape is ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" We gave you the full truth.

As well as us giving you full information, we actually would be glad to tell the public about ancient martian civilizations. NASA would benefit greatly from something like that. You see, we aren't getting funded as well as we would like. So something as interesting as alien life-forms would definitely get us more money to explore more. Simply put, the public's thirst for exciting information would drive the government to fund us. Unfortunately, the face is just a creation of nature, but we'll be more than glad to inform you if we ever find signs of alien life.

In addition to the fact that NASA is always glad to provide information, we took very clear pictures that show just a desolate mound of rock that is naturally made. We took three pictures of the face. One was in 1976, the next in 1998, and the last in 2001. Jim Gavin (of NASA) explained that the newest pictures would show things such as man-made pyramids and villages. Of course, those would prove the face to be man-made as well. However, such things aren't seen in any of the pictures.

Overall, we know that there will always be people that don't believe in the facts. However, there is solid evidence (such as witnesses and pictures) to back us up. They all point to the ""face"" being a natural formation. I hope that this essay has helped eliminate doubt in the public. Just remember, NASA is glad to inform you of any signs of alien life when we find it.",0,675
"Yes, there is a Face on Mars and some people say The Face was created by aliens, but that statement is not true aliens did not create The Face. In fact, it is just a natural landform. This landform was actually a lava dome that just got shaped funny when the lava got hard enough to stay the same for the rest of time, unless something happened awful on Mars. We can state the fact that aliens did not build The Face because we have used the best camera and seen that there is no evidence that aliens build The Face. It is just like something we would see on earth it just happened naturally like how the Grand Canyon got on earth no human or alien built the Grand Canyon. It is just a natural thing that had happened just like The Face on Mars. In the picture that

NASA took has been zoomed into, and the zoom would have picked up anything that was on the ground and there was not anything that showed that aliens or anything had built The Face there was absolutely nothing around the face that the aliens could have even used to build The Face out of. Therefore, The Face was in fact not build by aliens. The Face is just a natural appearing thing on Mars and there is no sign of anyone or anything building The Face on Mars especially not aliens.

"There are many advantages to using electronic dictionaries in English learning. For one, electronic dictionaries are more accurate than traditional dictionaries. Electronic dictionaries are constantly updated with the latest words and expressions, which makes them more accurate than traditional dictionaries that are only updated once a year. Additionally, electronic dictionaries are more user-friendly than traditional dictionaries. E-dictionaries are easy to use and navigate, which makes them more accessible to students. Finally, electronic dictionaries are more affordable than traditional dictionaries. This is because electronic dictionaries are not bound by the same publishing restrictions as traditional dictionaries, which allows them to be more widely available.

However, there are also some disadvantages to using electronic dictionaries. For example, electronic dictionaries may not be as accurate as traditional dictionaries. Electronic dictionaries are constantly updated with the latest words and expressions, which may not be accurate for all words and expressions. Additionally, electronic dictionaries may not be as user-friendly as traditional dictionaries. E-dictionaries can be difficult to use and navigate, which may not be easy for students to use.

"Introduction:
Hey there! I've heard you're convinced that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. While I understand why you might think that, I'm here to tell you that it's actually a natural landform. I've read the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and I'd like to share some evidence with you that supports my argument.

Body:
First, let's talk about the location of the Face. The article states that it's located in the Colonia region of Mars, which is known for its unusual terrain. This includes the presence of mesas, which are flat-topped hills that can form in a variety of ways, including erosion and volcanic activity. The Face is actually a part of one of these mesas, and its shape can be explained by the natural geological processes that formed the area.

Another important point is that the Face isn't a perfect rectangle or square, as one might expect if it were created by intelligent beings. Instead, it's an irregular shape that's been eroded over time by wind and weather. The article mentions that the Face has been exposed to the harsh Martian environment for millions of years, which has caused it to deteriorate and lose its original shape.

Furthermore, the article mentions that the Face is made up of a type of rock called dolomite, which is common on Mars. This suggests that the Face is not a structure built by aliens, but rather a natural formation made up of the same materials as the surrounding terrain.

Finally, the article states that the Face is not unique on Mars. There are other similar formations on the planet, including one called the ""Thous,"" which is also a natural landform. This suggests that the Face is not a one-of-a-kind structure created by aliens, but rather one of many natural formations that can be found on Mars.

Conclusion:
So there you have it! While it's understandable to be fascinated by the idea of alien life on Mars, the evidence suggests that the Face is simply a natural landform. Its location, shape, composition, and similarity to other formations on the planet all support this conclusion. I hope this information has been helpful in convincing you that the Face on Mars is not a creation of intelligent beings, but rather a fascinating example of the natural wonders that can be found on our neighboring planet.",1,679
"Life has revolved around driving since the termination of World War II. In sources 1 and 4, the authors mention the population's inhabitants have greatly reduced or stopped car usage wholly voluntarily. While in sources 2 and 3, the cities have banned car usage on certain days. The advantages of limiting car usage include less pollution and increased accessibility to the entire city.

Pollution is a large issue in today's world. According to Rosenthal in source 1, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States P5."" The use of cars has created smog in many large cities. The 2009 Olympics in Being required the city to reduce car usage in order to clear the air. Those participating and attending the event were in danger of harming their lungs. The citizens of Being has already been noted to wear respirators and other devices to filter the toxins from the air they breathe. In this extreme case, it was mandatory to cut the usage of cars down. But in other cities, they have not reached this extreme, and it can be easily prevented by limiting car usage. Duffer mentions the pollution in the skies of the global city of Paris has been noticeably decreasedP19. In another scenario of pollution in the atmosphere, the city has taken initiative to ban cars depending on the number of their license plate. Without the emissions from the cars, the air would be clean to breath and a better sight as well.

The new generation has grown up with cars yet when the time comes to obtain a license, they forgo the opportunity. Silky says that without cars, the city's parks and sports centers have been heavily visited. The pedestrian walkways and shopping centers have also come in large numbersP28. Due to the abandonment of cars, upscale commerce and new restaurants were constructed. Rather than a large mall near some interstate or other large roadway, shopping districts have transformed into locations in which are near public transportation or in walking distance. Rosenthal shares an anecdote that outlines that public transportation, carpooling, and even walking have replaced the car for himself and his childrenP40. Public transit is not viewed down upon anymore, it is a smarter way of getting from one place to another. Carpooling isn't a despite call, it is a resource that has become essential and beneficial to both parties. A combination of carpooling, walking, and public transit makes the city much easier to access and explore.

The development of cities is no longer based on cars. It is now be based upon the access it will give to those without cars. Limiting the use of cars makes the city improved in many ways. Clean air and more efficient ways of transportation highlights that cars are no longer needed and limiting car usage will have even more advantages in the future.",0,680
"Hearing multiple opinions can be very useful to solve situations. That is why when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choice by receiving different view points, they can obtain better advice, and they can get more than one solution for what ever they need help with.

One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is receiving different view points. For example, when I was in second grade I was made fun of for not playing basketball at a socially acceptable standard. I was stricken with rage due to the torment I got from the other boys. Their taunting led me to tell my parents. As we talked I expressed to them that I wanted to hurt them, I wanted to treat them the way they were treating me. I wanted them to feel the growing anger inside me. However, my parents quickly stopped me and told me that violence is never the answer. They acknowledged the way I felt but told me if I truly wanted to get back at the kids I had to practice. I asked them how practicing basketball would free me of my anger. They responded saying that If I practiced and became good at basketball the kids would have no reason to bother me about it anymore. I did what my parents said and practiced like my life depended on it. I soon was able to play almost better than everyone who teased me. If my parents had not shared another view point, then I would have lashed out on the kids who made me fell awful. My parents different opinion caused me to make a better decision. Another example of this is when I witnessed another kid getting bullied. In fifth grade a boy in my class was getting bullied by two other boys. I saw them picking on the other boy almost every day. I didn't want to interfere because I was afraid of getting bullied too. Furthermore, I tried to ignore the actions of the boys and just stay away from them. My plan to ignore them worked for a while, however, the burden was becoming to overwhelming. I told my sister about the situation to get it off of my chest. She then told me that I was right to not interfere, but I should have got a teacher involved. The next day I went to a teacher and told her about the bullying and from that day on the two boys stopped bullying the other boy. In both of these examples I sought after different opinions and I received different view points on the situations, which led me to make better choices. This is why one way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is by receiving different view points.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is because they can get better advice. For example, I tried to get my dad's opinion on an outfit I had prepared for a party I was going to. He said my outfit looked fine and that I should go to the party in it. For a second opinion I went to my mom to see what she thought.

She told me that it look awful. We then went into my closet and prepared a completely different outfit. At the party I got many compliments on my outfit, and it was all thanks to my mom. Another example of this is when I needed advice on what I should get for my friend's birthday. My friend Generic_Name's birthday party was around the corner and I still had not purchased a present for her. I asked some of my other friends what they thought I should get for her. They all said things like candy, jewelry, and clothes. Before I went to get anything I asked one last person, which was Generic_Name's best friend Generic_Name, what she would like. I told Generic_Name about the suggestions I got from my other friends. She said that she was glad I had not gotten any of those things because Generic_Name was not really into them. She said what Generic_Name did like was books. I kept this in mind and bought her an adventure book. When her party arrived she opened my present and burst into joy. In both of these examples I got advice from multiple people and some advice was better than others. Asking more people for their opinions led me to making better choices. This is why another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is because they can get better advice.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices is by getting multiple solutions. For example, I needed help on my math homework. I went to my Mom first and asked her for help. The work was on multiplication and division. My mom took a look at my homework and started to explain a method I could use to conquer multiplication and division faster. I understood the method but I didn't like it very much. I thanked her then went to my dad. Furthermore, I asked him if he knew a way to solve my work also. Luckily he did and showed me how to do it. I liked his way more, although it did take longer to do. I finally completed my homework using my dad's method. Another example of this is when I was in third grade. I was completing my math work and got an answer for a problem. My answer was 5/10ths. I then asked my friend Generic_Name his opinion on my answer, and he said that it was wrong. I asked him what he got, and he said 1/2. Together we went to the teacher and asked who was written. He said that we were both right, however, in this case we needed to simplify. This meant that Generic_Name was right. In both of these examples I got multiple opinions and multiple solutions and through these answers I learned better options for me.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is important to make better choices. That is why seeking multiple opinions can make help someone make better choices by receiving different view points, they can obtain better advice, and they can get more than one solution for whatever they need help with.",0,681

Dear Principal Smith, 

I am writing to share my thoughts on whether community service should be required for all students. While helping the community is certainly beneficial, I do not think making it mandatory is the best approach. 

Requiring community service risks having the opposite intended effect. If students feel like they are being forced to volunteer their time, it may create resentment rather than instill a sense of civic duty. Those who do not want to participate may half-heartedly go through the motions just to fulfill an obligation, without developing genuine care or concern for the causes they are supporting. Community service is most meaningful when students choose to get involved because they care about making a positive difference.

Instead of a mandate, I think a better option would be to promote and encourage community service opportunities. Highlight the various organizations and activities where volunteer help is needed. Provide incentives and recognition for those who volunteer a certain number of hours each term. Making participation optional but highlighting its rewards may inspire more students to get involved out of their own interest and motivation to help others, rather than compliance with a rule.

Of course, there will still be some students who have priorities other than volunteering and would rather spend their free time in other ways. As long as their schoolwork remains a top focus, we should respect students' freedom to allocate their extracurricular hours as they see fit. Not everyone is cut out for or interested in every activity. 

In conclusion, while I support the value of community service, I do not think making it compulsory is the most constructive policy. A voluntary approach that celebrates those who volunteer has the potential to engage more willing participants and avoid resentment from those who would rather not be required to spend their time that way. I hope you will consider these perspectives as you make your decision.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,682
" The passage set presents several examples of communities that have implemented car-free policies and the positive impact it has had on their residents. In this essay, I will argue that limiting car usage has several advantages, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased community engagement.

Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality. Cars are a major source of pollution, contributing to smog and other health hazards. In the case of Paris, the city enforced a partial driving ban due to high levels of smog, resulting in a significant reduction in air pollution. Similarly, in Bogotá, Colombia, the city implemented a car-free day, resulting in a decrease in air pollution levels. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce emissions and improve the overall health of our communities.

Secondly, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion. Cars are a major contributor to traffic congestion, which can lead to longer commute times, increased stress, and decreased productivity. In the case of Vauban, Germany, the community implemented a car-free policy, resulting in decreased traffic congestion and increased use of public transportation. Similarly, in New York City, the city implemented a congestion pricing plan, resulting in decreased traffic congestion and increased revenue for public transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall efficiency of our transportation systems.

Thirdly, limiting car usage can increase community engagement. Car-free policies can encourage residents to engage with their communities and explore alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transportation. In the case of Bogotá, the city implemented a car-free day, resulting in increased community engagement and a sense of pride in the city's efforts to reduce car usage. Similarly, in Copenhagen, Denmark, the city implemented a bike-friendly infrastructure, resulting in increased bike usage and a sense of community among bike enthusiasts. By encouraging residents to explore alternative modes of transportation, we can increase community engagement and foster a sense of pride in our communities.

However, there are some potential counterclaims to limiting car usage. Some may argue that limiting car usage would be too expensive and burdensome for individuals and businesses. While it is true that implementing car-free policies can be expensive, there are several ways to mitigate these costs. For example, governments can invest in public transportation infrastructure, provide incentives for carpooling or using electric vehicles, and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation through education and outreach. Additionally, some may argue that limiting car usage would be inconvenient for individuals who rely on their cars for work or other activities. While it is true that limiting car usage can be inconvenient, there are several ways to mitigate these inconveniences. For example,",1,683
"The fail action coding seems like a good idea. My claim is that it would be cool to go into a classroom and be able to tell what mood you are in. It says in the passage ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" That would be a really cool thing to do at school. I think it's a good idea and I am not going to argue about this suggestion. If you can walk into a classroom, and you can tell if a child is happy, sad, confused or even just bored you will be able to know if they are okay. If a child is sad you can try and help them and out and see what is going on.

In the passage it says, ""hold on, we can actually calculate emotions."" well yes if you actually give it a try. It would be seriously so cool to know how someone feels just by looking at a screen when they walk into a classroom. I think it would help some students, honestly if you tried this experiment. Students wouldn't know what to think if they had this in their classroom. None can just walk into a classroom and tell if they are happy or sad. It says that ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans.""

They said that they have classified ""six basis emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This might help a lot of people out if they do this. If you can tell a kid is sad you can help the kid. Maybe he or she is having problems at home, and they need help, but they don't say it. The facial action coding system might help people. It's a good idea, but it's actually a real good experiment to test it out and see what's going to happen. You can always take it out if it doesn't work out, or if it do, you can keep doing what you are doing, and you'll be able to see kids facial expressions and what they feel when they tell you they don't feel anything.

Facial Action Coding is just a different way to experiment different things about children. Maybe teachers can bump their classrooms up to funner and more satisfying things, because you will know if a kid is bored in your class if they have that. It says that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Let's just try the facial action coding out and see where everything goes, but it seems like it's going to go good. I totally agree, and I don't argue with this experiment. You learn something new every day.  ",0,684
"The minimum wage has been a hot topic of debate in our country for quite some time. While some argue that it should be raised, others claim that it would have adverse effects on the economy. In my opinion, raising the minimum wage would be beneficial for several reasons.

First and foremost, a higher minimum wage would help to combat poverty. Many individuals who work full-time jobs still struggle to make ends meet, and this is unacceptable. A decent minimum wage would ensure that workers earn a living wage, allowing them to afford necessities such as housing, food, and healthcare. For instance, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would lift approximately 1.3 million people out of poverty.

Secondly, a higher minimum wage would help to reduce income inequality. The gap between the rich and the poor has been growing steadily over the past few decades, and this has had negative consequences for society. A higher minimum wage would help to narrow this gap by ensuring that low-income workers receive a fairer share of the wealth they help to create. For example, in Seattle, where the minimum wage has been raised to $15 an hour, studies have shown that the wage increase has led to a significant reduction in income inequality.

Thirdly, raising the minimum wage would stimulate economic growth. When low-income workers receive a wage increase, they are more likely to spend their earnings locally, thereby boosting the economy. This is because they have a higher propensity to consume, meaning that they are more likely to spend their earnings on goods and services in their community. In contrast, high-income earners are more likely to save their money, which can lead to a decrease in consumer spending and economic activity.

Furthermore, a higher minimum wage would have positive effects on employee morale and productivity. When workers are paid a decent wage, they are more likely to feel valued and motivated, which can lead to improved job performance and higher levels of job satisfaction. A study by the University of California found that employees who received a wage increase were more likely to experience a boost in morale, leading to improved job performance and lower turnover rates.

However, some argue that raising the minimum wage would lead to job losses and decreased employment opportunities. While it is true that some businesses may struggle to absorb the increased costs of a higher minimum wage, this can be mitigated by implementing a gradual phase-in period. Additionally, many studies have shown that the impact on employment rates is minimal. For example, a study by the University of Michigan found that the employment rate in Seattle remained steady after the minimum wage was increased to $15 an hour.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage would have numerous benefits for society, including combating poverty, reducing income inequality, stimulating economic growth, and improving employee morale and productivity. While some argue that it would have adverse effects on employment, the evidence suggests that these effects are minimal. Therefore, I strongly believe that the minimum wage in our country should be raised to ensure that all workers receive a decent and fair wage for their hard work.",1,685
"As a student in grade 12, I think that offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be a great idea. I believe that students would benefit greatly from being able to attend classes from home.

Firstly, distance learning would allow students to have more flexibility in their schedules, which could help them to balance their school work with other commitments such as work or family responsibilities. For example, if a student had a job, they could attend classes during their breaks, or if they had young children, they could stay at home to take care of them while still attending classes online.

Secondly, distance learning would also be a great option for students who live far away from school, or who have difficulty traveling to school due to disabilities or other issues. This would allow these students to still receive an education and participate in classes without having to worry about the challenges of getting to and from school.

Finally, distance learning would also provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and in a way that best suits their learning style. For example, some students may prefer to watch recorded lectures and work through assignments on their own, while others may prefer to participate in live online classes and ask questions in real-time.

In conclusion, I believe that offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be a great way to provide students with more flexibility, accessibility, and control over their education.",1,686
"I think the principal should require community service. This is because if teaches life lessons, and it is good for the community.

To begin with, I think the principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons that will help you in the future. For example, I volunteer for community service at a place called PET. This stands for Personal Energy Transportation. It is an amazing thing to do. You build all-terrain wheelchairs for handicapped people all over the world, but mostly in Third World countries. The wheelchairs have three wheels and are designed to go through deep sand, over sharp rocks, and up and down steep inclines. In this workshop, it teaches teamwork, and makes you more mechanically minded. It is also a very courageous, bold, selfless thing to do, and it will really change someone's life. Another example is that people sometimes down want to do certain activities because their boring. With required community service that will have to do things that they normally wouldn't do. By doing these things they build character and self-esteem. This will help them in the future with doing homework, getting into a good college, and even with wanting to do community service again. This is why our principal should require community service.

In addition, I think the principal should require community service because it is good for the community. It helps the community in times of need. For example, when you are driving down a busy road or highway you see people throwing bags, cigarette buds, and even clothes out windows of their cars, not worrying about were they end up, in sewers, on the sides of roads, even inside animals. There are some types of community service that actually pick up all this trash around a city. This is important because it teaches character, and it makes the city look better and more professional. Another example is that it community service could help other people in the community. There are elder homes where people drop off their elders that can't take care of themselves and people take care of them there. Some workers use this for community service or that is even their job. It can help you in the future to teach you how to take care of elderly people, and it even helps the community so the people that work out in the city don't get slowed down by having to take care of them. It could also make the elders feel wanted and feel comfortable in a new home. This is why our principal should require community service.

In conclusion, our principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons, and it's good for the community. Life lessons help you later of in life when trying to apply to a college or helping out a friend. Community service also changes people's lives.",0,687
"One topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. They course of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. Because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. They are not prepared for the world students in high school don't have any experience of any career.

I think is a little to early. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just want to do something new. All those classes that I selected from freshman year are not going to be worth it because you going to have to take new classes. For example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he searches it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. So he changes to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes, but I think the best decision for me during high school is to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. And to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career.

As you read you can see the reasons, I think the best idea for students is to focus on high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to select the best classes that are going to guide you toward a specific career.",0,688
"People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life.

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the courage to do subtend things.

You would believe in yourself and most possible make your goals come true.

It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt.

People won't be able to brake you down that easily.

So in my personal opinion, having a positive attitude actually is the key to a success in life.

When I said it gives you the courage to do subtend things I mean it.

Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or you're thinking ""oh there's no way I'm going to make it"".

That's the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action.

Sometimes your words reflect your actions.

This is why I think if you have a positive attitude you will success in life.

Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"".

Let's talk about why I mention ""faith"".

Having faith makes you believe in yourself'

When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action.

But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible.

This is why I compare these two words, that are very similar to each other.

So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a positive attitude.

Having a positive attitude can help you out emotional too.

If your positive at all times no matter what people say about you, it won't hurt you as bad.

The reason i believe it won't hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and won't let other negative attitude ruin yours.

For example, if I say to myself ""Man i already know i ain't going to pass this test, i ain't even going to try"".

Obviously I'm going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try.

So if you want to success in life like I do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",0,689

"I feel like it should and here's why. First of all what happen is someone is depressed and don't want to tell anyone about it, so they kill their self because they're depressed the facial Action Coding System could have help that poor boy or girl because someone would ask her what's wrong and talk about it with him or her and know they feel that someone there for them and how much they're needed and wanted, so they don't kill there self matter as fact there are happy right now because someone is there for them, and they feel wanted, and they can love life again. My evidence why I wrote that statement is the passage it said ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" I think everyone should have this because it could save a lot of people lives because so many people take their lives away so fast and young because of depression and lot are teens if high schools and jr high haves these I feel like it would change the world for the better. Some people don't like it maybe it's because they're the stress ones that need help and think that no one cares and is too scared to show they're depressed, and they rather keep to them self.

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for they can tell you what they did wrong, see their point of view, and learn what to do.

To begin with, they can tell you what they did wrong, so you will not do the same thing. If the person wants to do something good they would ask people for advice, so they will not do it wrong. They would tell them what they did wrong, so that he or she will do it right. For example, one day Generic_Name went to his friends what not to do at his wedding his friends started telling what not to do, so he did as they said, and his wedding went perfect.

Also, you can see their point of view. When someone is asking more than one person, because some people do it differently than others. Not everyone looks at something the same way others do they have different points of view. They ask multiple people, so the can have an idea of what to do and what not to do. For example, Generic_Name went to ask his friends for advice but all of them had different story's, but they had something's in common so that gave him an idea of what to do and what not to do.

In addition, you will learn what to do. When you ask more than one person it can help you make better choice's in life. When someone is seeking for multiple opinion It's because they want to make better choices, so when they tell you what not to do and look at their point of view they are helping you make better choices, so you don't do something wrong. On the contrary, some people think seeking multiple opinions cannot help someone make better choices, because some people can give you bad advice and can get you into big trouble.

In conclusion, asking people for advice is a good thing, because it can help you make better choice in life. Seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for people can tell you what they did wrong, see their point of view, and know what to do.",0,692
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents two both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In which I found that a driverless car would not be a good idea. I found this to not be a well-thought-out plan due to the technology could fail, the cars can't navigate through work zones or around accidents and human drivers would eventually get bored with sitting there and doing nothing and would want to eventually drive.

First, thing that would be on anyone's mind about being in a car that you can not fully control is what if an accident was to Accor or the car's systems began to fail? Who would be blamed the driver or the company that produced the car? In the article the author states that ""...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This proving that when the laws are changed the person who is at fault may not at all be fair since it could have been the manufacturer's fault and not the driver.

Second, reason why driverless cars would not be all the great is because the cars can not navigate thought work zones and accidents, so what good would a driverless car be when it can not even navigate around everyday issues. In the story it states ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This showing who the driverless cars won't be completely driverless which would then complicate things for certain drivers and, or the manufacturers in case of a navigation error.

Lastly, drivers would eventually get bored with just not doing anything and would want to drive but would not be able to because there cars would be self-driven. In the article on paragraph 8 it states ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?..."" This evicting how not only would you get bored while waiting since you can do other things while in the car if you have to drive, and you are doing something which you can't automatically take over it could cause and accident, and it would not be at all safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea due to the fact that the technology could fail and then who would be at fault may be a problem or simple unfair. The cars can not go through work zones or accidents so why would you want a driverless car that you still have to drive in case of something like that. Thirdly, drivers would be bored waiting for there turn to drive and if they were to do something else and could not automatically take control that could cause issues for themselves and other drivers. So why would you want a self-driven car when driving so such so much more fun and better?",0,693
"Some schools allow students to complete classes online or through video conferencing from home as an alternative to being on campus. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because this leaves optimal room for cheating, this could cause students to lack social skills, and this is an open opportunity for procrastination.

Having access to a computer or a cell phone is an advantage in the new technology-based generation. However, this leaves a place for dishonesty in work when used for in-home learning. Using the internet, you can access absolutely any information with a few clicks or taps. Websites such as 'Briefly' and 'Quizlet' are used by students seeking answers; they type in a question from their work and every answer for all the questions is right there in their hand. With cheating instead of actually learning and retaining knowledge, students will fall behind in the real world. In a classroom, most likely you will find that cell phone use is prohibited due to the fact that students don't use their phones for learning purposes. When students are guided by teachers instead of given the answers by computer, they are more likely to remember the information later in life.

Students who work from home are not around their classmates. Being isolated from people is one way children and teens can lack social skills that they will most likely need now or as an adult. In a classroom, you are surrounded by other people your age, and you all can learn from each other. Classrooms are one of the first places where you learn how to communicate and collaborate with others. These are only a few of the social skills you could lack from being alone every single day. These skills are needed for getting jobs when you are older and for many other opportunities in life.

Working from home is a plus for getting to sleep in every day and being allowed to work at your own pace, but some students could take advantage of this and procrastinate. As I stated before, in this technology-based generation, a cell phone is a good thing to have. However, that could also serve as a distraction. Instead of being in the classroom where students are required by their teacher to complete tasks daily, they are in the comfort of their own home free to do what they want to do. Watching television, talking on the phone, skipping work days, and oversleeping can all lead to falling behind in work and receiving failing grades. When you have a teacher pushing you to complete each task when it is assigned, you are more than likely to complete all tasks given to you on time. This way, you will keep up your grades while also learning a sense of responsibility.

In conclusion, students would benefit more from learning in a classroom than they would from working at home. They won't be able to cheat on their work as easily as they could from home, they will have good communication skills from being surrounded by their classmates, and they are less likely to procrastinate their assignments.",0,694
"I am against the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars need a lot of sensors. Radar was a device on a Hilton that cost two hundred million dollars. We should be investing that money on things that are important. For example help people in need, feed the hungry etc. Why would anyone wants a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't the drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? We are becoming lazier by the time. Imagine how much money the driverless cars will cost in the future. Most of wouldn't even have the money to afford them. We will still buy them, why? Because everyone will have them, and it will be the trend, we get carried away for what others get or do, and we want to do the same. If technology failed and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture? We shouldn't trust in technology, failure could happen. Hese were some reasons why I am against the development of driverless cars.  ",0,695
"Self-esteem is a crucial aspect of a person's life. It refers to the self-worth or self-value that a person has about themselves. Self-esteem is developed over time and is influenced by various factors such as family, friends, peers, and personal experiences. Positive affirmations from others can play a significant role in developing self-confidence, which in turn can help build self-esteem.

Courage, confidence, and trust are also essential components of building self-esteem. When a person is courageous, they are able to take risks and overcome challenges, which can help them build confidence in their abilities. Confidence is the belief in one's abilities and strengths, and when a person has confidence in themselves, they are more likely to take on new challenges and pursue their goals. Trust is also important because it helps a person feel secure and supported in their journey towards building self-esteem.

An example of a situation when an individual was praised and how it motivated that individual to reach a goal is when a student receives positive feedback on a project they have been working on. When the student receives praise for their work, they feel valued and appreciated by their teacher or peers. This positive feedback can motivate the student to continue working hard and striving for excellence in their future endeavors.

Adults can provide affirmations to younger individuals to help them build self-esteem. Affirmations are positive statements or messages that are meant to reinforce a person's self-worth. For example, an adult could say to a child, ""I believe in you and your abilities. You are capable of achieving great things."" These types of affirmations can help the child feel valued and supported, which can help build their self-esteem.

In conclusion, self-esteem is an essential aspect of a person's life that is developed over time. Positive affirmations from others, courage, confidence, and trust are all important components of building self-esteem. When individuals receive positive feedback and support from others, they are more likely to reach their goals and continue to grow in their personal and professional lives.",1,696
" First impressions are often difficult to change, as they are formed based on initial observations and assumptions. However, I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, and can be influenced by various factors such as personality, appearance, and communication skills.

When we first meet someone, we often form an initial impression based on their appearance, body language, and the way they speak. However, this initial impression may not always be accurate, as people can change their appearance or behavior to fit a certain situation or persona. For example, someone may dress up for a job interview or put on a fake smile to make a good impression.

Personality is another important factor that can influence our first impressions. We may assume that someone is outgoing and friendly based on their appearance and body language, but their personality may actually be quite reserved or introverted. Similarly, we may assume that someone is confident and assertive based on their communication style, but their personality may actually be quite shy or timid.

Communication skills are also crucial in forming first impressions. Good communication skills can make someone feel comfortable and confident, while poor communication skills can make someone feel uneasy or unsure. For example, someone who is good at making eye contact and actively listening to what the other person is saying may come across as more approachable and trustworthy.

Overall, while first impressions may be difficult to change, they are not impossible. By taking the time to get to know someone and understand their personality, appearance, and communication skills, we can form more accurate and positive first impressions. It is important to remember that first impressions are not always a reflection of who someone truly is, and that it is possible to change our initial perceptions based on new information and experiences.",1,697
"Introduction:

Educational activities are designed to help individuals acquire knowledge and skills. However, not all educational activities are enjoyable, which can make learning a chore. In this essay, I will investigate whether educational activities are enjoyable and explore the factors that influence what people find enjoyable. I will also examine the benefits of engaging in enjoyable educational activities and compare them to those of engaging in unenjoyable activities.

Types of Enjoyable Educational Activities:

There are many types of educational activities that people find enjoyable. These include hands-on activities such as experiments, field trips, and service learning projects. Other types of enjoyable educational activities include group projects, debates, and simulations. People also find activities that involve technology, such as educational games and online learning platforms, to be enjoyable.

Preferences and Enjoyment:

People's preferences play a significant role in what they find enjoyable. Some people prefer to learn through hands-on activities, while others prefer to learn through lectures and discussions.

"Research has shown that distance learning has both its pros and cons for student performance. On one hand, it provides convenience and flexibility, allowing students to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. It also eliminates the need to commute from place to place and can provide access to courses and educational resources that are otherwise not available in traditional settings. On the other hand, distance learning has drawbacks as well. Without the benefit of direct teacher instruction, students can experience a lack of guidance and support, as well as feeling a reduction in motivation and engagement. Additionally, online classes can be more susceptible to cheating and plagiarism due to the anonymity of the environment.

Although distance learning can be beneficial for students, it should not be viewed as a replacement for more traditional forms of education. In-person instruction provides a greater sense of community, as well as increased collaboration and interaction with experienced faculty. Furthermore, traditional classrooms can offer more individualized learning options and provide access to academic and social resources that are not available in an online environment. By understanding the advantages and disadvantages of both forms of education, students can make more informed decisions about the type of learning which is best suited for their individual needs and interests.",1,700
" Dear Teacher,

I am writing to express my thoughts on the importance of group work in the classroom. I believe that working in a group can be more beneficial than working alone, as it provides students with more opportunities to learn and collaborate with their peers.

One of the main advantages of group work is that it allows students to learn from each other. When students work together, they can share their ideas and perspectives, which can lead to a higher quality of work. Additionally, group work can help students to develop their critical thinking skills, as they learn to evaluate and analyze the ideas of their peers.

Another benefit of group work is that it can help students to develop their communication skills. When students work together, they must communicate effectively in order to achieve their goals. This can help them to become more confident and comfortable speaking in front of a group.

Furthermore, group work can help students to develop their teamwork skills. When students work together, they must learn to compromise and work towards a common goal. This can help them to become more effective team players, both in the classroom and in the workplace.

However, it is important to note that group work is not always the best option. In some cases, students may struggle to work effectively in a group, or they may prefer to work alone. It is important for teachers to be aware of these potential challenges and to provide students with the support and resources they need to succeed in group work.

In conclusion, I believe that group work can be a valuable tool in the classroom. When used effectively, it can help students to learn, collaborate, and develop important skills that will serve them well in the future.

"It is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While there is some truth to this, I disagree with the statement overall. While younger people often have more energy and optimism, older people can enjoy life in different ways.

To begin with, younger people often have more energy than older people. This energy can lead to a more active lifestyle, as well as the ability to explore new activities and places. When it comes to enjoying life, this energy is invaluable. Young people can explore the world around them in ways that older people often cannot. For example, a younger person may be able to hike to the summit of a mountain, whereas an older person may be physically unable to do the same. This energy can also lead to more physical activity, such as playing sports or going to the gym. This can help younger people enjoy life in a way that older people may not be able to.

However, while younger people often have more energy and optimism, older people can enjoy life in other ways. Older people have often lived longer and thus have built up more experience and knowledge. This knowledge can lead to a greater appreciation of life. For example, someone in their twenties may enjoy going out to a bar or club on the weekend, while an older person may instead enjoy a quiet evening at home, reading a book or listening to classical music. This type of enjoyment often comes with age and experience, and is not something that a younger person can fully appreciate.

In addition, older people often have more financial stability than younger people. This can enable them to do things younger people may not be able to do, such as traveling to exotic locations or buying expensive items. This financial security can often lead to a more enjoyable life than a younger person could have.

Overall, while younger people do often have more energy and optimism, older people can enjoy life in different ways. With more experience and financial stability, older people can often appreciate life in a way that younger people cannot. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

"There are a few reasons why I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. First, a well-rounded education provides a more well-rounded individual. A person who knows a little about a lot of things is generally more interesting to talk to than a person who knows everything about one thing. Furthermore, a person with a broad knowledge base is better equipped to deal with the complexities of the real world. The world is a complicated place, and it is very rare for any one person to be an expert on everything. Therefore, it is important to have a basic understanding of as many subjects as possible.

Second, a broad knowledge base provides more opportunities for success. A person who knows a little about a lot of things is more likely to be able to find a job that they are qualified for than a person who only knows about one thing. Furthermore, a person with a broad knowledge base is more likely to be able to find a job that they are passionate about. It is very rare for a person to be able to find a job that they are both qualified for and passionate about if they only have expertise in one specific subject.

Third, a broad knowledge base allows for more creativity. A person who knows a little about a lot of things is more likely to be able to come up with new and innovative ideas than a person who only knows about one thing. This is because a person with a broad knowledge base has a greater understanding of the world and how it works. They are also more likely to be able to see connections between different fields of knowledge.

Overall, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. A well-rounded education provides a more well-rounded individual, and a broad knowledge base provides more opportunities for success.

"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because considering different perspectives allows for more informed decision-making. Getting advice from more than one person provides a broader range of viewpoints and expertise on any given issue. Each person may have a unique insight or piece of wisdom to share based on their own background and experiences. By hearing multiple sides of a story or multiple potential options, a person asking for advice has more information to weigh the pros and cons of each choice. They can compare and synthesize the different opinions to gain a more holistic understanding of their situation and decision. 

An example of how seeking various opinions helped lead to a better outcome occurred when a friend of mine was deciding whether to accept a new job offer or stay in their current role. They consulted with not only their parents and spouse, but also their manager, coworkers, and friends who had recently changed jobs themselves. This allowed them to get input from those who knew their abilities and work history as well as those familiar with the different companies and responsibilities of each position. Incorporating perspectives from both their personal and professional networks helped them carefully consider factors like growth opportunities, work-life balance, and company stability that any single person may not have brought up. After weighing all the advice, my friend felt confident that they had made the choice that was best for their long-term career goals and needs.

In summary, getting multiple opinions provides a decision-maker with well-rounded guidance by exposing them to new ideas and mitigating individual biases. It enables a more informed final choice that takes numerous relevant viewpoints into account rather than relying on the perspective of just one or two advisors. While a single person's advice can certainly help, the complexity of most significant decisions warrants seeking opinions from various trusted sources.",1,704
"In recent years, there has been a growing trend to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative forms of transportation. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and range from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving public health and creating more accessible communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and mitigating their effects on climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive effects on public health. As the number of cars on the road decreases, so does air pollution, which has been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, by promoting alternative forms of transportation such as walking and cycling, we can encourage a more active lifestyle and improve overall public health.

Limiting car usage can also create more accessible and sustainable communities. Instead of relying on personal vehicles, smart planning focuses on creating compact communities that are designed to be easily navigable by foot or public transport. This approach allows for the placement of essential amenities, such as shops and services, within walking distance, reducing the need for long-distance car travel to meet everyday needs. By making communities more compact and accessible, we can reduce sprawl and preserve green spaces.

Moreover, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion, particularly in densely populated areas. By promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit, carpooling, and biking, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and ease congestion. This not only reduces travel times for individuals but also improves overall traffic flow in cities.

While the idea of limiting car usage may seem daunting to some, it is a necessary step towards creating more sustainable and livable communities. Initiatives such as car-free days and the promotion of alternative forms of transportation have already shown promising results in various parts of the world. By embracing smart planning and reducing our reliance on cars, we can make significant strides towards a greener and more sustainable future.",1,705
"Celebrities are a necessary part of our entertainment industry, and as a result, they are frequently in the public eye. While some individuals believe that famous people deserve a higher degree of privacy from the media, others believe it is the cost of their fame. In my opinion, celebrities should be granted a certain degree of privacy, but the media is also required to report on them.

Famous people are entitled to their personal lives, and the media, in general, has a tendency to be overly intrusive. Celebrities, like any other person, want to be able to go about their day-to-day lives without being hounded by the media. Their privacy should be respected, and they should be allowed to enjoy their personal lives in peace.

However, it is also true that fame comes with a price. Celebrities receive a lot of attention and adoration from the public, but they also receive a lot of criticism and scrutiny. In many cases, this is due to the media's desire to report every aspect of a celebrity's life, including their personal and private affairs.

While it is important to respect celebrities' privacy, the media has a duty to report on public figures. Famous people are role models for many individuals, and they are expected to act in a certain way. As a result, the media has a responsibility to report on their activities and behavior. It is important to keep the public informed about what is happening in the lives of celebrities, especially if it has a direct impact on their fans.

In conclusion, I believe that celebrities should be given a certain degree of privacy, but the media also has a role to play in reporting on their lives. While it is necessary to respect their personal space, it is also important to keep the public informed about their activities. The media should strive to strike a balance between respecting celebrities' privacy and reporting on their public lives.

"Are you very active after school? Do you participate in extracurricular activities? I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities. I agree with our principal's decision he made on making every student participate in an extracurricular activities because it allows them to get out more, make new friends, and they are able to support their school.

First of all students must join these activities because it allows them to get out more. Everyday now you see a bunch of kids playing video games, talking about how awesome they are, or even blowing money on them. Pushing the student to join school clubs or a sports team will take them away from those games. On the other hand, some kids don't have things to do after school. They just go home sit down and do nothing. If they join an activity they can have more fun after school. Trust me, as I have had some personal experience, it is not fun to be at home and have nothing fun to do. Also, as time goes on scientists have noticed that child obesity has increased as well. They need to stay active The after school sports are there to help those numbers go down.

Secondly, little ones can make new friends in after school programs. If they make new friends they won't be lonely anymore. For example, some kids are the only child. Yeah, I get it, that sounds amazing in a child's perspective, but it is always more fun to do something with a friend. If they don't have those friends, then they will be doing everything by themselves. Also, if a child is having problems at home or struggling with something in life, joining their new friend in a school activity will help them keep their mind off of it. Adding on to what I just stated, kids like to hide their emotions and tell everyone everything is alright when sometimes it really isn't. If children make new friends, then they will have someone to vent off of and let everything out. Once they do talk to them, then there will be someone right there to help them.

Finally, students can help support their school. Schools have many things to do throughout the year and very little time to do it. Joining council clubs or yearbook clubs will help the school get things done that are needed. Additionally, athletes can represent their school in a team sport that they like. To specify, at my high school football is a big thing. Many people love the game. The kids at the high school represent their school when they play good in their games. This will get your school out there and well known. Finally, kids can make their school a better place. Many clubs like to support many subjects like no bullying, or don't do drugs. If more and more kids join a club that thinks this way kids will start listening and making the school a safer and glorious place.

As I have stated, allowing students to get out more, make new friends, and helping support their school are all reasons students need to join an after school activity. I agree with our principal. After school programs are definitely worth a shot at trying out. Plus, it doesn't take a lot to participate in an activity, so get out their and join a club or a sports team now!",0,707
"In 6th grade my parents forced me to sign up for student council. At first, I was upset, and I was trying to convince them to change their mind. They didn't. The next week I had my first meeting and I loved it. My first meeting was the highlight of my week. I wish there were meetings every day, but sadly there weren't. The only reason I got involved in student council was because my principal made the decision to offer student council and many other extracurricular activities. Students should participate in at least 1 school activity.

One reason students should participate in school activities is so that they can make new friends. Dr. James Arnold once stated that ""friends are like oxygen the more friends the better, and you need friends to live just like you need oxygen to live."" This shows that it is impossible to have to many friends. There is no negative effects to having too may friend. Participating in school activities is a great way to make new friends. Dr. John Washington said that ""I once signed up for my school yearbook because I liked taking pictures, but I was a little worried because I didn't know anyone in the club. So I tried to make new friends. I met this kid named Alex, and we became best friends till this day.""

It is clear to say that joining school activities is a great way to make new friends.

Secondly, it is true that going a school activity can also help the community. A serve taken by Johns Hopkins University shows that an average of 4 trees are planted every year by each U.S. school. With all the global warning going around the world it is clear that every tree being planted by U.S. schools will help the earth and that is all because of school activities. Some schools have a greens program that helps clean the earth. Normally the program meets once a week, and they go and plant a tree, pickup trash around the community, help garden, and sometimes they volunteer to help the less fortunate. Students should be proud that they are helping the community in such great ways. The school should recognize the program and help to get more people to join the program. Programs like these are great for the community and environment and should be in every school in the county, but that's not my choice.

Lastly, students work really hard during school and deserve to do something fun and school activities is the perfect way to reward them. A report done by Oregon University shows that 89% of kids feel like they work better after 10 minutes of getting some fresh air. Students can be getting that fresh air by doing school activities. School activities combine learning and life skills together. By letting students go outside they are getting fresh air so that they aren't stuck in a school building the whole day.

Some people might think that doing these school activities is a waist of time and kids should just be learning the whole time. Although, they are particularly true it is also true that in order for kids to get a good job they need to be a respectful person and most jobs and colleges require community service hours. By joining these school activities they prepare you for the future. Tobias Johnson is the president of the company smart bond. He once stated that ""when I first started my company I only hired the people that have given back to the community and the people that seem like they have a kind hearts."" This means that these school activities will benefit them in the future. By joining these programs you can also put them on your regime and that shows that you have helped the community or helped your school by doing the right thing. Company and colleges will look at that and think this person is a leader. All good companies have leaders guiding the companies and employers to do the right thing. If a company didn't have any leaders to guide their company the company would fall apart and argue a lot. In the end picture it shows that most of the students that take school activities end up most successful in the future.

Ultimately, it is clear that doing school activities will benefit the students a lot through the use of making friends, helping the community, and getting the kids some sun while in school. By adding school activities to every school in the U.S. we can change the future of our society. If we don't start now by trying to change our students then companies will fail. If companies fail their will be no competition for buying goods and everything will be overpriced. We need to act now. If you want to help call or email your principal and try to persuade him to add student activities to your school system. If you already have school activities then be active in joining them and try and convince your classmates to try and join them. This is our future.",0,708
"Decreasing car usage would serve as a benefit to our communities and environment. Many countries are already being influenced by the new trend. As proven that without cars we could provide ourselves with cleaner air, physically healthier bodies and a more pleasant social atmosphere.

With the purchase of a car comes the consequences of our only environment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", it is shown that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States"". If we started to limit car usage these numbers could drop giving us cleaner air to breathe and a longer lasting environment. Some heavily populated cities such as Beijing, China are so polluted that there is a smog covering the entire city. The thick, gray cloud over Beijing is caused primarily by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars and various other pollution sources. Not only is Beijing to be held accountable but also cities in Europe such as Paris. From source 2, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it is said that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"", because of the over usage of diesel fuel vehicles Paris had to put a fault to motorists for a few days. If Parisians were not complaint with the ban they were fine with 22.

Giving up your vehicle for a day or two may seem like an impossible task but if you were not to have it there would be health benefits. We created the car for a reason, to get places quicker, safer, and more efficiently. Now that we have successfully done that and have been doing it for quite some time, we have become much too dependent on them. I'm not saying to completely give up the usage of our beloved vehicles but just become more aware of when and where to we use them. If people used their cars a little less and started walking places, biking, skateboarding, etc. we would have a much healthier community. People wouldn't be so lazy or unfit, and it would create a more sociable community.

Limiting car usage would enhance the idea of being social with your friends, family, a neighbor, or anybody for that matter. You could see more people walking down the street as opposed to being inside a car with a limited number of people. It would break down barriers of being afraid if you are walking alone, instead you'd have plenty of around who are mostly aware of their environment.

Car usage should be decreased a bit more than it is now for a better community and environment. We only have one planet, and we should do as much as possible to try and keep it as clean as possible for as long as possible.",0,709
"I think if we limit the usage of cars it could possibly be a good thing. America has very high pollution a lot of it comes from cars, second only to power plants. If say Jacksonville decided to be car free it would be hard because Jacksonville is the biggest city, according to how much land it takes up. But Vauban in Germany is the perfect city for it because it has 5,500 people in a rectangular square mile which is small and allows people to walk from place to place. But Jacksonville, say if I wanted to walk to Orange Park it would take a long time because it is already a 45-minute drive.

If America was to become car free then there would be a lot of complications, such as if you live at the beach and have to go downtown for work and cant catch a bus. I think America should pick one city to start this and if it works well then move it to a whole state and only allow buses and taxis to be driving around. In America the driving peak has already passed, in 2005 was when the highest amount of cars and most driver license were given out.

An advantage of being ""car free"" would be that the stress of everyday life would go down. A lot of stress results from cars and driving. If you get stuck in traffic your going to get mad but we wouldn't have to worry about traffic anymore because we would be either walking or taking buses/taxis. Also, local business would be making more money because if a person is walking they are going to want to eat what ever is nearest to them. People live very close to some local business and instead of just driving by them all the time you would actually eat there.

Looking into the future I could see honestly say I don't see America becoming car free. I see it staying in Europe the reason I say this is that we have a lot of everyday commuting going on, in every city, in every state someone is almost always out driving whether its to catch an early flight or to get a head start on a road trip. People are always driving. Looking back into the past, a lot of people did walk places, and then more and more people started driving, and it eventually caught on.

So now once again I ask you, do you think America will ever become car free? Do you think less, and fewer people will start driving or will the number of drivers increase? People who have tried this seems to be a little less stressed with could ultimately help us all.",0,710
"The ozone layer is dissolving, there is no scientific question about it. The world is covered in pollution and in a million years the sun is supposed to swallow most of the planets in the solar system. If we need to flee our planet we need to find our best options and Venus might be one of the best.

Venus is often referred to as earth´s twin, it is about the same size and density, and contains many geographical features that are found on Earth. Many of the gases on this planet can be found on Earth or even be breathed out of your own body (CO2). Venus has many similarities to the Earth we love, learning as much as possible about Venus can help us in the long term. In the text the author talks of how Venus is right around the corner from us and how scientists are trying to build a spacecraft that will be able to withstand the temperatures of the hostile planet. If we humans can access information of the planet, when our ozone layer is completely perforated we may be able to switch planets for better living conditions.

Knowing what thrives around us and our planet is not particular a bad thing. We may have to make adjustments to our work ethic, but it will eventually pay off in the scheme of things. What if there is more life out there? What if the movies you grew up watching are more nonfictional than first thought? Precious metals that can be used to fight wars on Earth are plentiful in surrounding planets and asteroids, we just need to find them. Regardless the ozone layer of our planet will not hold forever, we need to know our options for our future progeny.

In conclusion the risks may be high, but the reward is much higher, we need to explore our options as homo sapiens and decide what the risks are worth. The stakes are set pretty high for us, and Venus just may be the answer we've been searching for.",0,711
"I wholeheartedly agree with the best way to travel being in a group led by a tour guide. There are so many amazing things to see and do when traveling with a tour guide, and it’s so much more fun than traveling on your own.

One of the best things about traveling with a tour guide is that you can learn so much about the local culture and history. You can also learn about the customs and traditions of the country you’re visiting, and you can get a real sense of the people and the way they live.

Another great thing about traveling with a tour guide is that you can be sure that you’re getting the best possible experience. A tour guide is experienced in the area you’re visiting, and they know how to get the most out of your trip.

Finally, traveling with a tour guide is a great way to make new friends. You’ll be spending a lot of time together, and you’ll be able to get to know each other better. This is a great way to build lasting relationships, and it’s a great way to have a great time while you’re traveling.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students do need cell phones at school at some occasions. But, phones are distracting during class and should not be allowed during classes. You should enforce Policy 1, let students bring phones to school, but make them turn the phones off during class, because if you enforce Policy 2, not let students have phones in school at all, students may need phones but won't be allowed to have them.

In times of emergency, students may need to call their parents, the police, the fire department, or other people while in school. With Policy 1, students would be able to take their phones out, turn them on and make a call. But, with Policy 2, students won't be able to make any calls and things could be very bad. Letting students use their phones during lunch or any free blocks will not hurt that student or other student's studies and should be allowed. However, students should not be allowed to use phones while in the library. The downside to Policy 1 is that students may try to use their phones during class, but you should instruct teachers to confiscate any phones that they see on during class.

I hope you agree with me on my choice of phone policies and that you do enforce Policy 1. It would help students and any other people in the school if students could use phones outside of class.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0,713
"The invention of driverless cars is a perfect idea. The driverless cars have many developments and improvements. Driverless cars can alert drivers to when something bad is about to happen. The cars are eco-friendly because they use half the fuel that taxis use today. With all the improvements it has, these cars will be one of the safest cars on the road.

With all the improvements on the driverless car the car will be safer. They have invented a track that sends signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. The reason for this is the senors to alert the driver. The senors tell the driver what is all around them. They have developed senors to help alert the driver when something bad is about to happen. The senors have become more advanced, and are able to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. The information from the senors can make the car apply the brakes on the individual wheels and reduce the engine's power. The most important piece of technology is the Dubbed LIDAR. It uses laser beams to scan 3-D images of the car constantly. This allows the car to have a better response and control than a human driver alone. General Motors have developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. With all the new technology being developed, these driverless cars will be safer.

The driverless cars will be a safer car. These cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash. The makers of these cars believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. The reason for this is the senors to alert the driver. The senors tell the driver what is all around them. Another reason these are good cars, is that they use less fuel than the average car, and it will have more flexibility than a bus.

Overall the driverless car is a safer car. It will have the new technology that the other cars do not have. The senors will help alert the driver when there is something behind them or to the side of them. The senors help make this car a safer car for all people. People all around would want this car because it is safe for children and other people. They should developed this car because it is safe for the environment and for other drivers.  ",0,714
"Dear Senator,

There have been multiple arguments on whether or not the Electoral College should be used for electing the President. Electing a President by the Electoral College is a better idea than electing a president through popular vote. Representatives know what is right for their country while most of American citizens would not make the right decisions, and sometimes do not even make any decisions at all.

First off, citizens themselves elect their own state representatives for the House of Representatives. They vote for them for many reasons. The representatives are well-educated. The people vote for the representatives, and in return, they expect and trust the representatives to make the right decisions for them. Electing a new president is a pretty big deal and should be taken care of in the hands of the trusted representatives. According to Richard A. Poster's article

Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the P

Resident, that trust is rarely betrayed.

As stated in reason 3 of this article,

""

[...]the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" The Representatives are the most thoughtful voters. This is what the representatives do. It is their job. They dedicate most of their life to representing the people who elected them and making decisions on their behalf. They should be the ones doing the decision-making.

Now if this were not to be this case and popular vote was the priority source of votes in electing a President, then the voting results would be completely biased. There would be a chance that majority of the votes put into the ballot were decided without true thought. People could easily vote on something important just by randomly electing just like closing your eyes and choosing a marble out of a marble jar. They could also vote for the candidate who their best friend voted for and not even think about their own opinion or why they even decided to choose that person in the first place. Another thing that affects the voting charts is the lack of participation. 15% of Americans do not vote. Every American citizen has the right to vote. It is their civil duty to vote during an election, and yet, 15% of them still choose not to.

What is better: A country run by people making uneducated decisions on major things or having the thoughtful people be the ones who decide on the course of this country?  Unless America increases the quality of education and spreads the word on the amount of importance that it is to vote, important tasks such as electing a President should be kept in the hands of the educated Representatives of the Electoral College. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

An American Citizen ",0,715
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my concerns about the Electoral College and to urge you to support a national popular vote for the President of the United States.

The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives more power to some voters than others. In the 2016 election, for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president. This is not the first time that the popular vote winner has lost the election, and it will not be the last.

There are several reasons why the Electoral College is unfair. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. A voter in Wyoming has three times as much power as a voter in California, simply because Wyoming has three electoral votes and California has 55. This is because each state is guaranteed at least three electoral votes, regardless of its population.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of ""swing states"" where the election is likely to be close. This means that voters in states that are already considered ""safe"" for one party or the other are essentially ignored. In the 2016 election, for example, Trump did not campaign at all in California, which is a solidly Democratic state. But he did campaign heavily in Michigan, which is a battleground state that he ultimately won.

Third, the Electoral College can lead to a situation where the person who wins the popular vote does not become president. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. When this happens, it undermines the legitimacy of our democracy and makes it seem like the only people who matter are the voters in a handful of swing states.

For these reasons, I believe that we should abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would be the fairest and most democratic way to choose our leader.

I urge you to support a national popular vote for President. It is time to make our democracy more representative of the people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,716
"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research different types of online activities like shopping, playing games, and connecting with people on social media sites.  It's like, super easy to get sucked into these things, you know? But, like, is it perfect for us? 

So, I found out that there are pros and cons to each of these activities. For example, shopping online can be super convenient and save us time and money, but it can also be really overwhelming and make us feel like we're always buying stuff we don't need.  And don't even get me started on the whole privacy thing. 

But, like, the thing is, connecting with people on social media can be really great too. We can stay in touch with our friends and family who live far away, and even meet new people with similar interests.  It's like, a big ol' global community or something. 

But, here's the thing.  I think it's important to have limits to how much we're connected to the online world.  Like, I don't want to be one of those people whoare always on their phone or computer and misses out on, like, actual life experiences.  You know?

And, like, I think it's okay if not everyone knows everything about us all the time.  I mean, have you seen some stuff people post on social media?  It's like, who needs to know all that stuff about someone? 

So, yeah.  I think it's important to stay connected to the world, but we should set boundaries for ourselves.  And maybe not share everything about ourselves with everyone.  It's like, balance, you know? 

Anyway, that's my essay.  I hope you liked it.",1,717
"When it comes to learning new things, many of us feel overwhelmed at the thought of taking on something unfamiliar. However, if approached with the right tools and resources, learning something new can open up a range of opportunities. One practical example is that of Paula, who decided to learn to code to enable her to create a digital platform to help develop her community. With the help of online resources and mentors, Paula was able to take her project from concept to completion. 

With bigger projects, it is helpful to enlist the help of another person or group to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. It’s also important to consider the consequences of not doing something; for example, not taking the time to learn how to code may have limited Paula’s ability to bring her project to life.

Finally, it’s essential to accept help whenever it is needed – don’t forget that it’s OK to ask for assistance when it comes to new endeavors. With the right support, learning new things can open up a world of possibilities.",1,718
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I do think that helping our community by doing community serves is very important.

We need to keep our community clean. If we don't, it will just look like a big trash can.

It is important that kids help, it's not so hard to give up one hour of your day to help the community. If we start with the little things we can make a difference and do something bigger and better.

I think the reason many kids my age don't want to help is because their just stubborn a not willing to make some time for helping things like this one special. Kids think that they have better things to do than help others even I'm like that sometimes.

We don't really understand the importance of this task if we let our towns, our cities, or communities build with trash we'd be destroying our world. I think It's that kids old and young want to help our community. It builds character and I would like the opportunity to do community serves.

It's really offal to see trash on the side of the rode or highway because someone was careless on just through it out of the car or on the side of the rode while they were walking and that's why I require that we start community serves.  ",0,719
"Should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricular activities. Yes because they provide information and fun for the students. Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity because we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity, so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.

Extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade, and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.

By taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest, so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student, so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.

Being active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams, so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so I could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.

Extracurricular activities give lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them, so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities help kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. Extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",0,720
"As the end of the school year approaches, I began to grow with excitement. Finally, I have a break from the stressful school work. However, as I thought I would be free from the chains, I am held back once again as teachers began to assign tedious summer project. Tired and with my strong desires of a break, I waited till the last couple of weeks of summer before starting on the time-consuming project. Recently, an argument has risen about whether summer projects should be student deigned or teacher designed. People who believe that the projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects would increase the percentage of participation on these projects. Others, who believed that it should be teacher designed, argue back that the knowledge teachers have on the curriculum allows the projects to be truly designed for its main intention. Teachers should be designing this summer project because of their knowledge of the future curriculum and their understanding of the mindset of students.

Teachers are well-equipped with the knowledge of the future curriculum, thus they have the ability to adjust their lesson plans to help assist their students for the upcoming years. Seen by many students, lessons or skills learned in the previous school year are used in the present school year. For example, math facts, such as addition and subtraction, are constantly being referred to in all math courses. Acknowledging this reality, teachers would try to shift their lesson plans around for the purpose of trying to strengthen their students' ability to understand such skills. Similar theory is applied to the designing of summer projects. Teachers, with the knowledge of what is expected in the next couple courses of a students' life, would be able to shape projects into helping the students prepare for the upcoming school year.

Teachers' understanding of the mindset of typical students causes the summer projects to be unbiased. People who believed that the summer projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects will encourage for more participation, due to the fact that these projects will have a more simple design and be easier to understand. However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regard to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many students willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects.

Having an easier summer project not only doesn't shift the percentage of participation, but also causes a strain in the development or knowledge of the student over the summer. Almost all teachers have witnessed students who refuse to complete homework, thus, they understand that lowering the difficulty would not change participation. This observation causes the teachers to not design the projects in favor of student's emotions, but rather design the projects according to the theory of helping their students.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have understanding about future curriculum and understanding about the actions of a typical student. One of the main goals of a teacher is to assist students or help students succeed in life. Therefore, logically, everything a teacher does is to benefit the students. Teachers, unbiased about the emotions of a student, will challenge their students into achieving high goals. In their best efforts, teachers would try to assist their students in trying to acquire beneficial skills. Teachers understand that some students will try to challenge authority by refusing to complete assignment, instead of signing in defeat, they will be persistent in their teaching methods because they understand that defeat wouldn't help the student. Thus, teachers should have the opportunity to design summer projects because they are guaranteed to have design projects that benefit students. Many successful businessmen, doctors, or scientists, credit their success to teachers. The profession of teachers has existed for many generations and have been known as the source of many successful people's success. Therefore, their ability to create a summer project should not be questioned.  ",0,721
"Have you ever thought about how life would be like in the future? How technology would develop? Or How people would come up with new forms of transportation?

"Dear principal

Us students want to help with the cell phone decision. We understand this is a hard decision. But there are many reasons why we should keep our cell phones. First we use our cell phones in case of an emergency. Next we also use them to call are parents.

First, we use our phones for emergency's. If the nurse wasn't at school, and we felt as if we broke our leg we can use our phone. We can also use our phone if we get sick. Also, when girls have there personal problems we can use it to call our parents. The phones can also be used to text a sick friend the homework assignment. This is some minor reasons we need our phone.

Next we use our phones to call our parents. Some students may need to call there parents in case they need a ride. They may also have forgotten there phone and need someone else's. Students need a phone in case they forgot there uniform for a sport they do. This is why we should keep our phones.

Finally, there are some reasons you may want to band them but there minor problems.

One of them is because students text during class. But the teachers can just take them away. The students also listen to music. But just besides these two minor problems keep cell phones.

"There are plenty of advantages fellow citizens get for having limited car usage. Fewer people are getting there license and using cars each year anyway.

In addition, it is true that people without cars would have to go through the rain or the cold weather every time the weather looks ominous and people would have to worry about getting to school or work on time. But, Limiting or taking away cars would clear the air of smog and fewer people would have stress.

First, by limiting car usage you can reduce smog. ""After says of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If all cars or vehicles were to stop being used the air would clear easily, and we can all live in clear air. ""The smog clear enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If they made like a schedule for which days cars will be banned and what days aren't, then the air we breathe will be better than ever and everyone will still be able to use there cars how they feel like.

Last, People will become less stressful when not using a car to get to places. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, ""said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife""(Silky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá""). Without cars there's people walking along the side walks talking, people not having to worry about safety on the road as much, people riding bicycles and skateboarding, and just a great way to excerise just by walking outside. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,' said Bogotá Mayor Antennas Mocks""(Silky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá""). The fact that people don't care about the rain makes me think that people are enjoying this car-free day and there's no reason to stop it.

In conclusion, A few days or even weeks without cars is a great idea for reducing stress and air pollution. There are even more reasons why we should have a car-free day like time conservation, emission lower age, safety improvement, and resource conservation.",0,724
"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the Chinese culture and modernity will likely vary from country to country. However, in general, it is argued that the traditional practice of not telling patients the truth about their cancer is not in their best interests.

First and foremost, the practice of not telling patients the truth about their cancer leads to a number of negative outcomes. For example, patients may be unaware of the severity of their condition, which can lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety. Additionally, they may not be able to make informed decisions about their treatment, which could lead to a poorer prognosis. Finally, they may not receive the best possible care, as doctors may be reluctant to give them information that they do not want to hear.

These are just a few examples of the negative consequences of not telling patients the truth about their cancer. It is clear, then, that the practice of not telling patients the truth about their condition is not in their best interests.

However, there are also a number of benefits to telling patients the truth about their cancer. For example, patients are more likely to take action to prevent the spread of the disease, and they are more likely to receive the best possible treatment. Additionally, they are more likely to have a positive attitude towards their treatment, which can lead to a better prognosis.

All in all, it'seems clear that the practice of not telling patients the truth about their cancer is not ideal. However, there are also a number of benefits to be gained from doing so.

"When faced with a tough decision, most people ask for multiple opinions on it. Asking numerous people for their opinion can help someone establish which choice would be best. If someone were to ask another person with lots of life experience, they'll probably get a reliable opinion on the situation. Plus, if you ask for advice from various people it's as if you're taking a poll on which choice would be best. There are several legitimate reasons to ask multiple for advice, and doing so is extremely important.

People can rely on the elderly, or more experienced people, to get credible advice in a situation. A good example would be Master Rogue, featured in the beloved movie ""Kung Fu Panda."" Po, the main character of the movie, turns to Master Rogue for advice in his situation. As a result, Po gets a valuable perspective and comes to his decision. There are numerous examples as to why someone should trust experienced people for advice.

When a person asks for various perspectives, they will most likely go by the advice most people have aforementioned. Everyone goes through different experiences and events. So, asking more people will have a more successful outcome. Asking multiple people gives you a more impartial opinion and will not be affected by unusual bias.

In several ways, asking many people for advice can be a good idea. Doing so will give a better perspective on the situation. Also, asking more experienced people will ensure the chance of getting reliable advice. Overall, there are several reasons why someone should ask for various opinions.",0,727
"We should allow students with C averages to participate in other activities. Studies show that students that do extra activities do better in school. Researchers have 3 reasons why kids should do extra activities. They are, one the kids feel welcomed and a part of something, two it keeps the students from doing other things that might get them into trouble, and lastly it is a fun experience for kids.

I hope these reasons speak for themselves so to speak. All the kids with C averages are just hopping that you will not approve of such a cruel policy.

Don't you want to go somewhere where you feel safe and welcomed? I know many people would. It is the same for kids, they want to feel like they are a part of something and don't want to feel left out. They want to explore new things and feel good about it and if you but a restraint on that then you are causing a huge problem for us growing kids. We need to find what we are good at and what we want to do in life and if you but a halt on that because of an average then you are basically taking away our childhood. Which person wants to do that? Studies in the local newspaper show that kids grades 6 through 12 do 20 percent better if they participate in sports teams or clubs. Now wouldn't that look good on our test scores? I hope you look at this in a different view.

Many kids nowadays are getting more and more involved in drugs and the street. Doesn't that scare you. Think about it, kids in grades as low as sixth are doing and selling drugs for money. Police say that if we can keep kids off the streets more often then there will be less and less drug dealing kids in the US.

Doesn't that make you feel good if you can crack down on drugs and kids. It is said that kids with bad lives and grades who can't do things turn to drugs as an escape plan. So if we came stop this our kids will be better off. I hope you can see that we shouldn't limit kids because of their grades.

Every kid just wants to have fun and just hang out with friends right? So if we can help them do that then why not do it. If we can give kids a safe fun environment to hang out in then they will obviously do better in school. Every kid just want to be accepted and not be judged, so if we can help stop that then we should do it to the best of our ability. Enjoyment is the main reason for life so why take it away from our youth. Jefferson said we have 3 reasons for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now who want to go against one of the Founding Fathers? I know not to many people want to tray that one. So lets not punish our kids for their grades by not putting them on sports teams.

" Going to school with an extended release time can be a dream come true for some students, but it may not be the best solution for everyone. While it may seem like a great idea to give students more time to learn and grow, there are several reasons why an extra hour should not be added to the school day.

First and foremost, most students may not have a pleasant experience with an extended school day. After a long day at school, many students just want to go home and relax. An extra hour in school may make them feel tired and agitated, which could negatively impact their learning and overall well-being.

Secondly, an extended school day could be confusing for parents. Many parents have a specific time that they pick up their children from school, and if the release time changes, it could cause confusion and chaos. This could lead to misunderstandings and potentially dangerous situations for the children.

Finally, an extra hour in school could also impact after-school activities and transportation. Many students participate in after-school courses or sports, and an extended school day could mean that these activities would have to be shortened or moved to a different time. This could be inconvenient for both the students and the providers of these activities. Additionally, after-school buses would have to change their schedules to pick up students in the afternoon, which could cause further disruptions.

In conclusion, while the idea of an extended school day may seem appealing, there are several reasons why it may not be the best solution. It's important to consider the impact on students, parents, and after-school activities before making any changes to the school day.",1,729
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people, and that all of our votes are counted equally.

The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century when the United States was a very different country. At the time, there were only a few states, and the population was much smaller. The Electoral College was designed to give more power to the smaller states, but it is no longer necessary or fair.

In today's society, every person's vote should count equally. The Electoral College gives more power to some people's votes than others, and this is not right. It is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election because of the Electoral College. This has happened five times in American history, and it is a disgrace.

I believe that the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people is to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would be fair, and it would ensure that all of our votes count equally.

"There are some schools that require summer projects for the students. What if they were student-designed rather than teacher-designed? With student going into their summer break and also teachers the thought of school really doesn't come to mind. With the requirements of the projects of students during the summer maybe students can add their own spice to the mixture. My thoughts on the idea that the project should be student based is that they can have their own personality to their project, put their own time into it, and the teachers can get to know their students.

With the idea that the project should be student based they can add their own twist to the project. I have a friend who went around Europe with her family during the summer. During her time there she still had to do a project for one of her classes and wasn't getting back home till a week before school started back up again. So during her stay she went to the popular places in Europe and tried to make connections of those places for her project. She told me that she had a lot of fun doing that with her project and that it even made it fun for her when she would edit it because it reminded her of the fun times that she had over there. Even though during the trip she said she preferred that she didn't have to work on a project during the time that she was away from school. She still had fun during the process with the idea that she had control over how she wanted to design it.

There are many students that usually get summer jobs, so they might not have all the time in the world to focus on a project. My brother was someone that loved to work and when summer came around he would work all the time. He was in art classes in his high school years, so they had to get some art pieces during the summer. At times at work if things weren't busy he would just get a napkin and draw little sketches that might come to mind. With some of his days off he would look back at the little sketches that he made and see if anything thing that he drew would give him inspiration. That's how he would do his art project, and it worked for him. He pulled out multiple beautiful artworks that to this day he is very proud of. At time, he wouldn't do some artwork since he might have been very busy the day prier and might have been very tired. He still had pushed even harder when he did work on the project. My brother would work during the summer and with the spare time that he had he would more effort into the project with the time he had free.

Teachers can already get a basic idea on what kind of person that they might be getting in their coming up class. I'm good friends with my sophomore history teacher, so we talk before school. She planned a project for the upcoming sophomores to see what's their personality was and if they basic history. She told me that she can see many personality in her class by just looking at their projects. Some students are very artistic, or they know details about certain events that went on in history. You can see so much in a single project of a student that they make it into their own. Right out of the back she already knew how to approach and what they can do in the future so that the student get their education but also have their own talents shine through. Some students might not put so much effort into their projects, so we might not get a head start into their characteristics. It is nice to at least to have a good understanding of the students before you actually meet them, so they can have an amazing school year.

With the idea that students should be able to design their own summer project is something that should be talked about. In the past most of the assignments are teachers giving it to the students and expecting them to follow a rubric. Things can change with the student must come up with something that they are proud to show and make it their own. With something small can lead to bigger things like just a simple summer project. Students should be able to add their own personality into it, put their own time into it, and that teachers can get to know the students though their project.  ",0,731
"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay on the benefits of providing students with healthy meals during school:

Hey, guys! Today I'm gonna talk about why it's super important for schools to provide healthy meals for us students. I know, I know, you're probably thinking, ""Ugh, do we really have to eat that stuff?"" But trust me, it's actually really important!

First, eating healthy meals at school can help us focus better in class. When we're stuffed with junk food, we might feel drowsy and distracted, which can make it hard to pay attention to what the teacher is saying. But when we eat nutritious food, we feel more energized and alert, which makes it easier to learn stuff. Plus, who wants to sit through a whole class period feeling like they're gonna fall asleep? Not me, that's for sure!

Another reason why healthy meals are important is that they can help us maintain good health. When we eat foods that are high in sugar and salt, it can lead to problems like obesity and diabetes. And let's be real, no one wants to be the kid who's always getting picked on because they're too heavy. So by providing healthy meals, schools can help us avoid these kinds of problems and stay healthy overall.

Also, eating healthy meals at school can help us make better choices when we're at home. When we get used to eating nutritious food at school, we're more likely to make the same choices at home. And let's be real, it's way easier to grab a bag of chips or a slice of pizza than it is to make a salad or some other healthy food. So by providing healthy meals at school, we can learn how to make better choices and eat healthier overall.

Finally, providing healthy meals at school can help us feel more included and supported. When we're eating healthy food, we feel like we're part of a community that cares about our well-being. And let's be real, who doesn't want to feel like they're part of a community that",1,732
"Work assigned over the summer is very much dreaded by students, but does that mean students should be the ones designing these assignments? A majority of schools assign summer assignments to ensure that students still receive an education during their time off from school. While there is much debate on whether the student should have the right to design these projects, the best option is for these projects to be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures that students will work efficiently, understand the topic, and that the assignments will be safe and appropriate.

In order to have quality work produced, and productive students, summer projects must be teacher-designed. Having set rules and requirements created by teachers, ensures that students will complete the tasks to a high level. During the summer, students would rather not have educational work to focus on, but projects created by the teacher enforces these students to do so. If these projects were student-designed, it could potentially allow them to finesse the system, and create a project that does not require much thinking and work. Student-designed projects also leaves room for error. Projects constructed by students leaves the door open for many mistakes, which will ultimately hurt the student in the end. This prevents students from working efficiently and fully understanding the topic they are working on. The goal of teacher-designed projects is to not control the students, but to make sure that the students are obtaining knowledge, understand the assignment, and are producing high quality work. Students may be confused or have numerous of questions with student-designed projects since there are no specific guidelines and rules, so having teacher-designed projects are ideal because they explicitly state what they are looking for.

Teacher-designed projects come with a list of guidelines and criteria that prevents students from working on something that could potentially be dangerous or inappropriate. If students had the ability to come up with their own projects, it gives them an opportunity to select a topic that could be unsafe or not school appropriate. This is especially important for science projects or English assignments. Giving students the power to choose their projects could be risky when it comes to these two subjects. For science projects, students could end up harming themselves with unsafe chemicals or substances because a lack of a rubric and criteria created by the teacher. For English assignments, students might choose controversial topics that are not appropriate for the school environment, but would not know due to a lack of strict guidelines. The possibility of projects being unsafe and inappropriate are not likely if they are designed by teachers.

Some may argue that assignments should be student-designed because it allows the student to express themselves creatively through their work. By displaying their creativity and thought process, it makes the idea of having work over the summer more enjoyable. However, having projects that are created by the student leaves room for interpretation, which could confuse students, and may take them in the wrong direction. In addition, some students may not be that creative, and cannot come up with a project on their own. Teacher-designed assignments still allow students to show what they know, but with stricter guidelines to ensure that quality work is being produced from the students. If students are allowed to design their own projects, it might result in an end product that does not meet the standard of work it should, especially since students would rather not complete work in the summer. Because of these issues and flaws, having student-design projects is not a wise choice.

Having teacher-designed projects is the best option for both teachers and students because it guarantees that students are working hard to meet the requirements of the assignment, comprehending the topic of the project, and working on projects that are both safe and school appropriate. In order for schools to ensure that students continue learning during their break, the most effective project for students to work on, is one designed by teachers.  ",0,733
"Cars are a convince to people worldwide. We use them to go to work, school and many more places on a daily basis. Even within walking distance, many still choose to take their car out of laziness. Is this how we should really live?

In an upscale community in Germany called Vauban, the streets are completely ""car-free"". Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this new district. Though car ownership is still legal, places to park are very limited. Only 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars. 57% sold a car to move there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walter. (3) Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.

Paris has also done something similar to better the lives of their citizens. Paris, France's capital city has banned driving due to smog. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. Paris has a strict schedule on when you can drive if you really have to. On Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-Euro. 22 Euros is equivalent to $31 in U.S. currency. This ban has led to almost 4,000 drivers being fined. (12) And 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction to the fine. The amount of smog before this ban was applied was 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter. This is a significantly high difference in the amount of smog compared to Brussels with 114 micrograms and only 79.7 in London. Although, the ban has helped clear this smog, enough on Mondays to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

Vauban and Paris both have very excellent results in their experiments due to the changes in their environment with cars. Maybe more cities in the near future will join in on this ban against cars. Instead of driving your car to the nearest pharmacy to pick up some things, take a walk to save gas and to get some fresh air. Maybe this ban isn't for everyone, but even trying to limit car usage to minimal can help the environment. Instead of driving your car to the nearest pharmacy to pick up a few things, try walking there. You'll get some well needed exercise and fresh air.",0,734
" The desire for multiple advice is a common human experience. It is natural for individuals to seek guidance and support from others during challenging times in their lives. However, not everyone is comfortable asking for help, and there are many reasons why people may be hesitant to seek advice. In this essay, I will explore some reasons why people want multiple advice and how seeking multiple opinions can help individuals make better decisions.

One reason why people may seek multiple advice is because they are unsure of what to do. When faced with a difficult decision, it can be helpful to seek the opinions of others to gain a better understanding of the situation and to explore different options. Additionally, seeking multiple opinions can help individuals to gain a more well-rounded perspective on a situation and to consider all possible outcomes.

Another reason why people may seek multiple advice is because they want to validate their own thoughts and feelings. When seeking advice from others, individuals can receive feedback on their ideas and opinions, which can help them to feel more confident in their own decisions. Additionally, seeking multiple opinions can help individuals to gain a better understanding of their own values and beliefs, and to make decisions that align with those values.

A third reason why people may seek multiple advice is because they want to gain a broader perspective on a situation. When seeking advice from others, individuals can gain insights into how others view the situation and how it may impact them. This can be particularly helpful when seeking advice from individuals who have experienced similar situations in the past.

In conclusion, seeking multiple advice is an important part of making informed decisions. Whether seeking advice to validate one's own thoughts and feelings, to gain a broader perspective on a situation, or to explore different options, seeking multiple opinions can help individuals to make better decisions. As a parent or friend, it is important to be supportive and open to helping others seek the advice they need. By providing guidance and support, we can help individuals to navigate challenging situations and to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs.",1,735
"Adventures at the Sea

You should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program because. You get to learn about so many animals. Furthermore, you get to know how much they eat, and what they eat. As stated in paragraph six it says. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Another reason you should try this program is because it is very big opportunity. You get to see the world. You get to know what it is like at sea. Maybe you might like it. And decide that you want to do it for a living on your own ship. It says in paragraph nine. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

My last reason is that you may be able to learn what other countries are like. Wouldn't you like to go explore the world? See what it is like in other places. My stated can be supported by paragraph five. It states in the paragraph. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says. ""So was taking the gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Those are the reasons why you should going the Seagoing Cowboys program today !  ",0,736
"Working four days a week for an extended period of hours can be beneficial for many reasons. Firstly, it allows for increased productivity as fewer days are required overall to complete tasks, allowing workers more time to recharge and be motivated when at work. Additionally, it also provides people with more free time that can be devoted to activities such as hobbies or further work. However, it may be difficult for some to keep up a consistent amount of energy for ten-hour days as well as managing daily tasks like family obligations and responsibilities. 

Extending the school day by two hours can provide students with more time for learning, allowing them to explore more topics or delve deeper into existing ones. This can offer them a better understanding of new information and deepen their knowledge overall. On the other hand, it could be difficult for students to keep their attentions going for two extra hours, particularly those who may be struggling with certain subjects or have other commitments outside of school.",1,737
"Are you for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expression? No, I do not believe we as a whole should be able to use this. The reason why I believe this should not happen is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The fact that a computer is able to distinguish this type of information is very scary.

In the article the author Nick D' Alto talks about Mona Lisa he says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (Alto 1). This quote itself is nerve racking due to the fact that a computer is able to find this information out. Using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions would be helpful, but it would not be professional. Honestly who would want to see what a teenager feeling?

There are many other ways this technology can be used such as prison. So we are able to track prisoners feelings. Overall using this type of technology on a group of innocent people is unprofessional. This type of technology should be controlled properly.",0,738
"In this essay I will be describing why it's important to study and pursuit Venus despite the dangers that are involved. Scientists know that sending human life to Venus is just out of the question right now, and it shouldn't be done, but they are working on ways around that. Scientists have sent spacecrafts to Venus unmanned, but they only lasted for only a few hours.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could've possibly supported various forms of life. Today, Venus is still like Earth in some ways, there are valleys, craters, and mountains. There is no way Venus could support life now because of the conditions of the planet. 97 percent of the planet is carbon dioxide and the average temperature of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Scientists are trying to figure out and solve different ways they could find information on Venus. NASA has come up with one pretty reasonable idea for sending humans to study the planet. They came up with the idea of having a blimp-like vehicle that would float 30 miles above the planet's surface. The temperatures at this height would still be hot, at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. The conditions wouldn't be easy, but humans would be able to survive.

Being 30 miles above Venus's surface would be hard to get information on the ground conditions, so NASA is coming up with new ideas. One idea they have is to use mechanical computers which haven't been used since the 1800s. These devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Using the computers we have nowadays would react terribly if we exposed them to the heat of Venus. If NASA were to use the mechanical parts, they would be more resistant to pressure, heat, and the forces.

With time and a lot of handwork, I think one day we could discover what Venus is really like. It would be a good idea to keep pursuing Venus because you never know, we could have life on that planet someday. We all know that this mission is dangerous, but we can't let that hold us back.",0,739
"Many people believe that the 'Face on Mars' was formed by aliens. What do you think? If you were told that the face on Mars was created by aliens, what would you do? What would you say? I know what I would do. I would call them crazy and explain to them that aliens do not exist and that it was a fact of science.

The 'Face on Mars' is a natural landform. The light from the sun is shone across the landform to make it look like it has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth like a human person, but, if you were to create an exact copy of Mars, put on a different scale, hold it still, and shine light at the exact angle of the sun, you would see that the sun is what really causes the 'Face on Mars' to appear to look the way it does.

Aliens, if they existed, could not have created something so magnificent and perfect that at that angle it would look like a face. Scientists have studied the geography of Mars for years and have had nothing to say about aliens. They have proven their facts and have given us reason to believe that this was simply the way Mars was structured and that the rays of the Sun are the cause of it looking like a face.

If aliens did create the 'Face on Mars', why would our scientist have not discovered them? Why haven't we ever then seen one before? For those that believe that it was aliens that sculpted Mars, I am sorry, but you are wrong. Mars was naturally formed and can never and will never be changed by aliens because aliens simply do not exist.

So, for all of those out there in our lovely world that think that aliens do in fact exist and that they somehow, over millions of years created a 'Face on Mars', I would like to say one last thing on my behalf, aliens do not exist and could not have created something so mind blowing. ",0,740
"There are many reasons to join the program. Today I'm going to convince you that people should be able to join.

I think it would be a great idea to join the seagoing cowboys program because... It would benefit them, they would be able to explore the world & I honestly think that would be great for them to experience the world. Another one is being able to help the animals with trouble that have been injured or left on the streets.

A good thing is you get to spend time with animals all day long! I think that would be fun. What I think is more fun is spending your time in the ocean, imagine being in a boat & all of a sudden you hear dolphins! How great would be?

It's not all just about helping animals once there all prepared & token care of you get to play with the cowboys! Baseball anything you desire they'll play. What It's really about i s opening yourself up to the world & being grateful for trying the opportunity & giving it the best you got! & being aware that other people need. Not just you, but other people will appreciate you.

But honestly my conclusion you should sign up because I think it would be fun & adventures!",0,741
"I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This is because advertisements are designed to create a positive image of a product in order to persuade people to buy it. For example, an advertisement for a car may show a happy couple driving down a beautiful road, when in reality the car may be uncomfortable and impractical.

There are a number of reasons why advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Firstly, advertisers often use exaggeration and distortion to make a product seem more appealing. For example, an advertisement for a shampoo may claim that it can make your hair “10 times softer”, when in reality it may only make it a little softer. Secondly, advertisers often use emotional appeals to make people feel like they need a product. For example, an advertisement for a new phone may show people having a great time at a party, and then say that the phone is the key to having a great time. Finally, advertisers often use images that are not realistic. For example, an advertisement for a pair of shoes may show a model walking on a beautiful beach, when in reality the shoes may be uncomfortable and impractical.

There are also a number of reasons why it is important to be aware of the ways that advertisements can mislead us. Firstly, advertisements can make us buy things that we don’t need or that are not good for us. Secondly, advertisements can encourage us to compare ourselves to other people, which can lead to feelings of anxiety or insecurity. Finally, advertisements can distract us from important issues and problems.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to be aware of the ways that advertisements can mislead us. We should not trust advertisements blindly, and we should always ask ourselves whether the claims that they make are realistic.

"I think you should and should not change that policy because of several reasons, but the biggest reasons are because most students will not have an average of a B. And the kids that want to be in sports will maintain there grades at BS.

The reason why I think students who want to be in sports or other activity's will not be able to maintain a B average in all classes. Most student that go to our school are more social than others from my point of view. Kids in preschool are exited to come to school every day and want to do school stuff and don't hang out with other kids. By time going by and them growing up to more social they are and wanting to go to the movies with friends and not do there homework. And when that happens in time it brings there grades down from A's to B's to c's. then they manage for the rest of there school time to manage that grade. Maybe sometimes students don't care if they have good grades or not but want to be in sports then they will maintain there grades at an average grade for it.

The reason why I think it should be changed too is because a person who wants to be in sports will try to keep there grades at a B just so they can be in sports. The kids will push them, so they can be in sports. They will push for something that they want. Most kids would try harder for something that they want.

Those are the reasons why I think they should and should not change the policy about the grade average from C to B to stay in sports or other activities.  ",0,743
"Driverless cars, something you never thought you'd hear in the twenty-first century. Driverless cars can be an amazing thing, but also be an awful thing if used horribly. Aside from the name driverless cars are not particularly ""driverless."" Sure there are some good things and some bad things to driverless cars, but the bad things out weight the good things. Driverless cars should not become a thing in the state of Indiana or any other state.

Say you're driving down the road with your spouse and children, out of nowhere a car comes flying at you, not slowing down or anything. The car rams right into you, killing your spouse and children. As it turns out the car was a driverless car, it had malfunctioned and the manufacturer claims that since they were not driving the car that hit you and killed your family, they do not have to pay, so you go to the person who was in the vehicle, and they claim that since they technically were not driving it either, they also do not have to pay. So now here you are, hospital bills, funerals to plan, and no money to pay for any of it. You are the one who got hit, you are the one who lost everything that day, but because the car was ""driverless"" no one has to pay.

Even with the name ""driverless,"" there still needs to be a driver while backing up, pulling into a driveway, or even through traffic jams. They try to get you with the name, but really you still have to drive. Long day at work, and you just want to go home and sleep? You are in your driverless car going home and all of a sudden boom, traffic jam. The car starts going crazy trying to get your attention, but you are in a deep sleep. Then it happens, a car got tired of waiting and rammed into the back of you. You go to court and the judge puts you at fault because you should not have been sleeping while on the road, but your 'driverless' car was supposed to take care of it right?

As said in the tenth paragraph, they are continuing to work on the assumption that the problems will be solved, what if they don't get solved? You could have just got a brand new driverless car, under the assumption that the problems will be fixed, but what if they do not get fixed? Are you going to be the next one to pass away or are you going to be the next one to kill someone? You will never know because driverless cars are unpredictable. Driverless cars are not safe.

On the other hand, driverless cars can be very convent, you're taking a long trip? No problem the car can drive most of it for you. You can sit and relax as the car is driving on the highways smoothly and perfectly. Driverless cars can get you the opportunity to be able to relax and not have the drive the whole way on your horrid trip. You can just sit back, relax, prop your feet up, and it will be all fine.

Even with the minor plus sides to driverless cars, many deaths can still happen. Things can still malfunction no matter how many times tested. Not one piece of technology is perfect, so why should this ""driverless"" car be any different? Trick question, it is not. The car can malfunction just as well as any other piece of technology or even any other vehicle. They make the car sound like it will end up being perfect, but it can not. Nothing is perfect, not even technology.",0,744

"Are driverless cars safe? Cars have been around for many decades and more to come. Cars are used in peoples everyday life. Cars are developing in many ways. I think driverless cars are not developed because; it's not completely driverless, It's challenging, and the car isn't advance.

First, driverless cars are not completely driverless. In the text it says,''this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.'' If the car isn't completely driverless there is no point on getting a car like this. This car can only handle driving functions up to 25mph. This mean the driver needs to keep hold of the wheels.

Secondly, the driverless car is challenging. It means it's hard to drive. Driverless cars are dangerous. It's not even driverless completely. This type of technology is sometime too advance for people. In the text it says, ''drivers have to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves.'' The driver is doing all the work.

Lastly, the driverless car isn't that advanced. In the text it says,''none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' This car tells you the the simplest thing. In the text it says,'' it notifies the driver when there's a work zone and accident.'' This car isn't really that helpful.

The driverless car isn't developed. You still should have a hand of the wheel. This is not yet completely driverless. This car tells you the simplest thing and not advanced. Why would anyone want a car that just tells you the simplest things that you can tell form just looking up at the road.",0,746
"I think that using technology to read a persons emotions could work. I think it could work in lots of ways like being able to read a students' emotion might help you make them feel better.

The article states that if a person is down a happy ad of some sort might make them feel better. Using technology to read peoples emotions is also a good way to tell if someone is mad and would rather be left alone or sad and would like the support of friends and family. Using technology for emotions is a very good way to tell if that's why someone is not doing their very best at work or at school you can use that technology to tell if they are sad. Using technology is a great way for people to see other peoples emotions because emotions are universal and knowing someone emotions is important. Emotions are a big part of life and emotions can almost determine how are day goes like if you're happy you might be happy the rest of the day or mad you might be mad all day or even surprised you high be in shock all day. Emotions are a part of who we are so being able to tell another persons emotions might help us. It could even help us with doctors one might be sad and down all the time but not look it but with this new technology a doctor could tell that the person might be depressed. A persons emotions can change every day like being frightened if we had this new technology people would be able to detect if someone is frightened. Some people have trouble explaining how they feel and we wouldn't have to worry about that anymore because we have thought of a new way to tell. Using a device to help tell a persons emotions this is a great new way to help everyone. That's why I think that using a new device to detect a persons emotions would help a lot.",0,747
"To the principal:

I believe that all students should not be required to perform in community service. Some students just have too much on there plate already, then throw in something else, it will cause much drama that the school does not need. Even though community service is a great way to help out and fix things in your community it will just take up way too much time your students lives. The downside to not having every student involved in community is that colleges look at the student and their extra activities they are involved in outside of school. I know that would help some students that are going to college on an academic and sports scholarship but yet again it would have seen a waste to some of the students that are planning on not attending college. This year if I had been forced to do community service it would have been a hassle for me since I play football and I am in double advance classes that takes up most of our evenings and sometimes even our weekends. Overall community service should not be required to all students maybe the ones who do not have anything to do after school or on the weekends that would be great but those who play a sport or are in a group, club or something like that it would not suit them well. Although community service is a very debated topic around the schools in our nation. It is as big as the board of education. So in the next few years we might see a law passed from the president concerning community service involvement in schools.",0,748
" Dear Mr. Principal,

In today's job market, it is important for employees to possess certain characteristics that can make them more valuable to potential employers. While it may not always be easy to determine what these characteristics are, it is clear that they play a crucial role in determining the success of an employee.

One of the most important characteristics that employees should possess is the ability to learn and adapt to new situations. In today's fast-paced world, employees are often required to learn new skills and adapt to new technologies. As such, it is important for employees to be open-minded and willing to learn from their mistakes.

Another important characteristic is the ability to work well with others. In most jobs, employees are required to work as part of a team. As such, it is important for employees to be able to communicate effectively, listen actively, and collaborate with others.

In addition to these basic characteristics, there are a number of other qualities that employees may be looking for in potential employees. For example, some employees may be looking for a manager who is experienced in a particular area or who has a proven track record of success. Others may be looking for someone who is passionate about the job and who is willing to go above and beyond to achieve their goals.

Ultimately, the key to success in the job market is to be adaptable and to be willing to learn. By possessing these qualities, employees can position themselves for success and increase their chances of finding a job that they love.

In conclusion, it is important for employees to possess certain characteristics that can make them more valuable to potential employers. These characteristics include the ability to learn and adapt to new situations, the ability to work well with others, and the ability to be passionate about the job. By possessing these qualities, employees can position themselves for success and increase their chances of finding a job that they love.",1,749
"There is no doubt that advertisements can be incredibly misleading. In many cases, products are shown to be much better than they really are. This can be extremely frustrating for consumers, who often feel like they can't trust what they see.

Some of the most common ways in which advertisements can be misleading include:

-Focusing on the positive aspects of a product, while downplaying or ignoring the negative aspects

-Using unrealistic or Photoshopped images to make a product look better than it is

-Making claims that are not supported by scientific evidence

-Using emotional appeals to convince people to buy a product

-Telling people that they need a product in order to be happy or successful

-Using fear tactics to scare people into buying a product

-Claiming that a product is a ""must-have"" or ""essential"" for daily life

-Targeting people who are vulnerable or insecure

There are many reasons why people might be vulnerable to these types of ads. For example, they may be feeling insecure about their appearance and be more likely to buy a product that promises to make them look better. Or they may be struggling financially and be more likely to buy a product that promises to save them money.

Some people might argue that all advertisements are misleading, and that it's impossible to trust any of them. I disagree with this position. I think that there are some honest and truthful advertisements out there, but they are in the minority. The vast majority of ads are designed to manipulate people into buying a product, and this can be very harmful.

People need to be careful when they're shopping, and they need to do their research before buying anything. It's important to read reviews, talk to friends and family, and ask questions about the product. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.

"Once you have researched how to gain confidence in order to change a first impression, it is important to look within yourself and reach a clear vision of how you would like to be perceived; this will serve as the bedrock for your journey. After reaching this point, it is time to formulate a plan of action. What steps are necessary to help you work hard to reach your desired goal? However, it is also important to identify the potential challenges one may face when attempting to change a first impression. Come up with possible solutions to problems you may encounter and develop a strategy to help you combat them. Finally, activities like ROTC can act as an excellent opportunity to gain the necessary skills to create a successful plan and therefore make the necessary changes to how you are initially perceived.",1,751
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author talks a lot about how driveless cars could be a good thing and a bad thing. My thoughts on driveless cars are negative. My thoughts are only negative because anything could go wrong.

One of my thoughts on driveless cars are what if you have to suddenly stop in an unknown place how would the car know it has to stop. A driveless car could be or maybe would be the cause of most car accidents. Everyone wouldn't even know how to work it because we went born with it. It would maybe be a great technology but most people wouldn't be comfortable doing or not doing something they haven't did all their lives.

Another one of my thoughts on driveless cars is when I think about a driveless car I think about all technology and there isn't a 100% chance that there won't be a malfunction. Most technology makes mistakes of has some type of glitch, so why would you put your life in the hands of a driveless car.

On earth, people are becoming lazier as the day goes by all the technology we have barely makes us want to move off of our couches. Which would also be another negative thought about driveless cars.",0,752
"Raising responsible and respectful elementary school children is an important lesson that should be taught in every classroom. Respect can come in many forms whether it’s respect for elders, peers, teachers and most importantly yourself. Learning should be embraced in everything a student does and curiosity should be nurtured. Learning allows for a student’s knowledge to expand beyond the school curriculum to help them make informed decisions in their everyday lives. Lastly, communication is a key factor which not only helps build relationships with peers but with adults as well. Communication aids in understanding, trust and cultural awareness. It is important for children to understand the importance of respecting self and others, being a life-long learner and being able to effectively communicate.",1,753

"The new software update, the Facial Action Coding System can calculate how people feel or what emotion they are feeling. This software is the fastest invention from Prof. The six basic emotions humans have can be read or showed by this Facial Action Coding System. This new technology is being tested to see if it is valuable in the classroom to read the emotional expressions of students. I believe this technology wouldn't be valuable in the classroom or learning environment. This technology doesn't benefit the students learning or relate to their school subjects.

Facial Action coding System can calculate human emotional expressions. It calculates how you feel or what you are feeling. I don't think this software would be valuable in the classroom because it is invading the kids personal space. Having the teachers or the computers always knowing how you feel is creepy. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Simple"" it states that humans perform this task or calculation of reading people's emotions every day. The article also states that humans most likely can tell how others or how their friends are feeling by looking at their facial expressing. Having Facial Acton Coding System in the classroom would just be unessasary and invading others personal space.

This software or technology only reads humans emotional expressions, it doesn't teach anything or help people learn anything benefiting to school. If this technology was to be put into classrooms it wouldn't be benefiting to the kids or teaching them anything related to their school work. The article states that the computer would be able to tell when a student is confused or bored while doing a season. Most schools don't even teach seasons on the computer a teacher teaches them the season they are learning. Also, some kids or even their parents wouldn't want a computer to be reading their children's emotions 24/7, also the students may not want to be monitored all the time as well. This technology just isn't beneficial to the learning environment in that sort of way.

The software update, the Facial Action Coding System is cool on how it reads humans emotions and tells you how they are feeling, but it just isn't valuable to classrooms or the learning environment. This software invades others person space by always monitoring their emotional expressions and calculating how u feel. Some people might find it creepy on the fact they are always being read by this new technology. This new technology isn't valuable to classrooms also because if it is not beneficial to kids learning. The Facial Action Coding System doesn't teach kids relating to their school subjects. Teachers teach the seasons and not computers this software wouldn't be pessary in classrooms.",0,755
"Cellphones & Driving

More and more people are finding access to cell phones as technology develops and becomes more inexpensive. Cars are starting to become more technologically advanced as well. With the ever evolving future of technology people are making questionable choices such as time and place of use. More and more people have began using their electronic devices as they drive putting not only themselves but the lives of others in danger. Cellphones should not be used while operating machinery such as a car or truck or SUV.

Behind the wheel is no place of use for cellphones. You're putting yourself in severe jeopardy of being hurt or killed. When driving you should always have your attention on the road as to avoid any bad situation or at least help prevent one. Cell phones distract you from this goal and may cause you to get side tracked. Without the use of phones behind the wheel there's less likely a chance that you will get into a wreck.

A lot of cars are becoming more technologically advanced as science progresses. We now have self-driving cars which can keep the driver hands free. These self-driving cars may still have trouble reacting to split second decisions in which May cause you harm. Even if you don't have to drive yourself you should still be focused on the road. A cell phone may be more appropriate in this situation given that you're not the one driving the car at the time however to ensure safety do not use your phone until the vehicle is safely parked and there is no risk of a wreck.

Bluetooth's technology has been changing the way we use electronic devices for years. With this there is no reason to constantly be in use of your phone when the Bluetooth streams the audio directly from the device to your cats radio. People have created mount devices for phone in cars to help keep you off them more but still do miniscule tasks that you may deem necessary. Many people put their phone in the back seat just to keep it out of arms reach and dampen the temptation of usage.

Ultimately cellphones in cars are a bad idea. Drivers still need to pay attention to the road rather than to a device that's endangering their lives. Despite all the advances in technology there's not a single one which ensures complete safety. The use of Bluetooth and other strategies to help limit cellphone usage may help if a drive is in need of a prevention plan for cell phone usage while driving. Don't endanger yourself or others by not operating a motorized vehicle with a cellphone in use.  ",0,756
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and promote healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. This trend is already being seen in various parts of the world, including German suburb Vauban, Paris, and Bogotá.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. In some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number increases to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that separate themselves from car use, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a decline in congestion. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time people spend in their cars, improving productivity and quality of life. In Paris, a driving ban was enforced during periods of severe pollution, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can have a direct impact on reducing traffic and improving air quality.

Limiting car usage also promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This shift has led to people adopting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and using public transportation. These activities not only contribute to increased physical activity but also reduce air pollution and reliance on fossil fuels.

Additionally, limiting car usage encourages the development of more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This concept is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, making suburbs more pedestrian-friendly and reducing the need for large parking spaces. By creating more walkable communities, we can promote social interaction, support local businesses, and reduce the need for excessive car usage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can positively impact individuals and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, alleviates traffic congestion, promotes healthier lifestyles, and fosters the development of sustainable communities. As seen in various examples around the world, including Vauban, Paris, and Bogotá, the shift towards limiting car usage is gaining traction and proving to be beneficial for both present and future generations. It is important for citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that promote alternative modes of transportation.",1,757
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes about how a new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions. I rather not be scanned by a computer to tell me my emotions. I don't think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable.

The first reason that I think we shouldn't have computer scanning are face because we need privacy. I wouldn't want a computer scanning me to see if I was happy, sad, tired, or mad. Example of the computer testing someone"" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Also, there's no need to know there emotions some people don't want you to.

Second reason is that I wouldn't want to pay for it. Some students couldn't afford it. Others could buy it but why would they are at school to learn not to know other peoples emotions. Example what the emotion scanner would do"" if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you from next ad will be I different."" This shows me that you don't need it because all it shows your emotions an what kinds ads others ruff that could help you. There's no point for this if it not helping you with school activities.

Third reason is what's the point of having this. It does benefit a little bit by changing stuff the computer to change our mood. Example of this ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" But rather than that it doesn't help us. It doesn't help us get good grades, doesn't show us what to do in class, and doesn't help your teachers either.

So in this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" where they other talks about computer showing your emotions isn't valuable to any school. The Facial Coding System is just showing your emotions not helping you in school. It's also probably very expensive some people couldn't afford it. That's why I think it's not valuable or needed in a school.  ",0,758
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and societies. It not only helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also promotes healthier and more sustainable living. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the benefits of limiting car usage and the potential for a shift away from car culture.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, individuals can significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, a car-free community mentioned in one of the passages, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% actually sold their cars to move there. This has led to a significant decrease in emissions in the area.

Limiting car usage also helps to create more sustainable and livable communities. By reducing dependency on cars, cities can become more compact and accessible to public transportation. Vauban serves as an example of this shift, with stores placed within walking distance, rather than in malls along highways. This reduces the need for large parking spaces and encourages people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling. In addition, limiting car usage can promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. In the case of Bogotá, Colombia, the city holds a car-free day every year to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participate in this event, hiking, biking, or taking buses to work. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also encourages physical activity, leading to better health outcomes for individuals.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of pollution. Congestion in the city decreased by 60%, and while delivery companies complained of lost revenue, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to the development of alternative forms of transportation and new business opportunities. For example, car-sharing programs have proliferated across the nation, providing easy access to transportation without the need for individual car ownership.

The decrease in car usage observed in recent years in the United States suggests a shift away from car culture. This cultural shift is influenced by a combination of factors such as the rise of the internet, which enables telecommuting and reduces the need for driving to meet friends. Additionally, the renewal of city centers has made suburbs less appealing and drawn empty esters back in. The younger generation is also less interested in car ownership, as demonstrated by the decrease in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds obtaining driver's licenses. This shift in behavior not only has positive environmental implications but also presents challenges and opportunities for the car industry.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the creation of more sustainable communities, promotion of healthier lifestyles, and potential economic benefits. Examples from different cities and countries demonstrate the potential for a shift away from car culture and towards more sustainable living. By adopting policies and practices that limit car usage and promote alternative forms of transportation, individuals and societies can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future.",1,759
" I would like to visit an engineering work place, or company. I would like to learn all about planning how do build something, and to they come up with good building ideas. What is the hardest part that an engineer has to take very serious?

If I were able to visit one of these companies, I would be thrilled. My mom has always told me that this is a great job, but it's a risk that people who want to have this job have to take in order to get paid well. One of my teachers in school, whose dad was an engineer, told me that he didn't like math because it was too hard, but he ended up getting a job in an engineering company, and he was successful. This teacher didn't like science or math, but he ended up teaching those subjects and became very good at it. I think that this shows me that I need to work hard in my pre-algebra class.

Engineering for me is easy to say, but I want to experience the challenges that come with it. On weekends, I work with my dad cutting the grass, and it's not easy. He always tells me to get good grades so that I don't have to spend my days working outside in the hot sun like he does. I guess that working all day in the heat is not fun. My dad taught me that working under the sun is very hard and can make your back hurt. When I'm older, I want to get a good job and help my parents, even though they told me that when I'm older they plan to go back to their home country of El Salvador.

I think that I would give engineering a chance if I didn't have any other options. That's one of the companies or jobs I would like to visit if it was close to my school. Another company or job that I would be interested in is frying airplanes. I've always wanted to fly one, but I think it's too hard, and I don't think I'll go to college.

"Should we be honest or not? We should be honest because people that you know very well, and you think that they would never lie to you that's going to hurt you the must. And if you are not honest people would never believe you.

People in this world lie a lot, and they are not honest. Who are we going to trust if people are not honest .if you lie all the time people will turn their backs on you and nobody is going to help you out if you have a problem. When you lie to people one way or another they will find out so be honest all the time. And if you lie to the people you love the most that's just sad because they give you so much incouregmentfor everything.

I think that if you are not honest you shouldn't be trusted by anyone. You give all of your trust to that person, and you say don't tell anyone, if that person does it anyway are you going to trust them again, I wouldn't. If you want to be trusted you need to start from more. So stop lying to every one you trust and be honest and tell the truth to every one. And be nice and don't get in trouble. If people believe on you, they're going to have your back no matter what.

People in this world don't liked to be lied to. Alot of people like to be trusted so be honest all the time not sometimes all the time.

"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" Rosenthal source 1 said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together. The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and companionship.

To begin, a benefit of limiting our car usage is fuel pollutes the air by circulating green house gasses that can cause a dangerous environment to form and by limiting cars we limit this pollution. With President Obama's issue to decrease the amount of air pollution caused by cars, many have realized that car usage is not as common as it used to be. If the number of cars on the road continues to deplete ""and many sociologists believe it Willie will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" Rosenthal source 4 says Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture."" By keeping track and trying to deplete the time you spend driving your car the trend of putting air pollution to an end will increase.

Additionally, a benefit of limiting our car usage is being able to use the cheaper and more efficient alternate means of transportation. By using alternate means of transportation such as buses, trains, and carpooling services you are saving gas money and supporting community business. There is a rise in carpooling that has ""facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" Rosenthal source 4 says Rosenthal. As these changes manifest many people are closing not to switch back to driving themselves.

Finally, a benefit of limiting our car usage can be found in the better companionship that will result as cities will make their stores closer together and communities more closely knit. In Bogotá, Colombia people are practicing ""carefree days"" and relying solely on public transportation. As this happens author of article ""Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá,"" Andrew Self, says ""parks and sports centers are blooming throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Silky source 3. Other places implementing carefree districts will never hear the roars of engines drowning out the chirping of the birds or children slaughter. In fact, stores and public transportation is strategically placed a walking distance away thus promoting social and physical benefits Rosenthal source 1.

The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and companionship. With greenhouse gasses rapidly circulating and polluting the globe it would be exceptional to decrease this by not driving as often. Furthermore, by using alternate transportation such as carpooling or taking a bus money is saved on gas and car repairs. Finally, goodwill and good social habits would increase as towns would become more closely knit as everything would only be a walkaway. With this if we should limit our car usage to ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" Rosenthal source 4.

" I firmly believe that failure is an essential part of human progress and success, as famously stated by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In this essay, I will present two reasons and examples to support this belief.

Firstly, I contend that failure drives innovation and pushes us to explore new possibilities. Consider the development of weapons, for instance. Without losing battles and wars, we would not have discovered new weapons such as nuclear bombs or hardened steel bullets. It is crucial to recognize that failure is a necessary step in the process of innovation. When we fail, we learn from our mistakes, and this knowledge helps us to improve and move forward.

Secondly, I argue that failure is a driving force behind technological advancements. The automobile industry is a prime example of this. Henry Ford's Model T was a revolutionary invention that changed the way we travel. However, it took years of failed experiments and rejections before Ford was able to create a fully functional automobile. Similarly, Tesla faced numerous failures before achieving success in the electric car market. Without failure, these companies would not have been able to create the innovative technologies that have shaped our world today.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's words ring true: ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" Failure is an essential part of human progress and success, driving innovation and pushing us to explore new possibilities. Without failure, we would not have the technological advancements and innovations that have shaped our world today.",1,763
"The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a ""Winnertakesall"" system. This unnecessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down.

In an instant, an electoral college voter could change his or her mind and go against his or her original political party. This is a completely unfair use of power because it reverses all the votes that went to the elector and to all the voters who were counting on the elector to properly represent their vote. The voters have no say in whether the elector will stay true to his or her party.

The easiest way to prove that the electoral college must go, is to reveal the facts. In source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College it states ""over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Multiple icons such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL CIO have stated they would like to abolish the electoral college as well! We now have the majority vote to put an end to the electoral college and the unfair system.

""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,"" says source 2. A tie in the votes, which is very much possible since the total number of votes is 538, according to source 1, could then allow the fate of America to rest in the hands of the House of Representatives, a miniscule representation of the people. If the voting system were to be changed to the popular vote, the results would accurately display the winner that the majority of America chose.

""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plume, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. The electoral college system does not represent the people of America accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. To conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is ""a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner "".",0,764

With the extra two hours, students could spend more time on the subjects of their choosing and focus more on making progress and improving their grades. Furthermore, additional support can be provided by teachers, who can devote more time to helping students develop their understanding of the material. 

On the other hand, there are some potential disadvantages associated with a longer school day. Students may face added stress if the extra two hours are used to add more coursework or other requirements. This could make it difficult for students to balance their school work with extracurricular activities and time to relax. Additionally, a longer school day could require additional resources such as additional staff, facilities, books, and other materials. This could result in increased costs for the school and parents.",1,767
"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the individual and their individual needs. However, some people might think that speaking English is more important for Chinese learners, while others might think that reading is more important. It really depends on the individual and their individual needs.

Some people might think that speaking English is more important for Chinese learners because it is a more powerful language. It can be used in a more powerful way in the Chinese market. Additionally, speaking English can help learners to better understand English-speaking people and English-speaking culture. Besides, it can help learners to better communicate with English-speaking people.

On the other hand, some people might think that reading is more important for Chinese learners because it is a more difficult language to learn.

"Participating in Adventure

As a lifelong cowboy, exploring new territories and facing unfamiliar challenges is what sparks my adventurous spirit. When I first learned about the Seagoing Cowboys program from the article, I knew it was an opportunity made for me. Spending months at sea herding cattle between Australia and Asia is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I hope you will consider, too. 

This program allows cowboys to trade in our horses for a ship and spend our days out on the open ocean. I was able to visit countries like Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan, seeing stunning landscapes I never could have from dry land. Each new port brought distinctly different cultures to absorb. However, the true adventure was the long stretches between stops. Out on the rolling waves, it was just me, the cattle and waves as far as the eye could see. Maintaining control of the herd during storms tested my skills in unforeseen ways. Navigating these challenges deepened my understanding of myself and strengthened my resolve.

The article detailed how my days were spent settling the cattle below deck, bracing against the swaying ship. While strenuous at times, seeing the herd and me adapt to life at sea was profoundly satisfying. Evenings were spent relaxing in foreign ports, drinking in the local sights. By program's end, I had experienced more of the world in months than most see in a lifetime. The lifelong memories and stories I gained will stay with me wherever the open range may call me next. 

If you have a yearning for adventure on the high seas and a way with cattle, I encourage you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Stepping outside your comfort zone builds character you cannot find elsewhere. The opportunities, experiences and personal growth you will gain are well worth any hardships encountered along the way. I promise you will not look back on this time with regrets but a full heart. The program is awaiting exciting new recruits to join me in riding the waves. I hope to see your application soon!",1,769
"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on individual circumstances. However, in general, young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people are.

One reason for this is that young people are typically more optimistic than older people. They are more likely to see the good in things and to be positive about the future. This can make them more enjoyable company and more likely to have a good time.

Another reason is that young people are typically more active than older people. They are more likely to be physically active and to enjoy doing things that are fun and exciting. This can make them more enjoyable to be around and more likely to have a good time.

Finally, young people are typically more open-minded than older people. They are more likely to be willing to try new things and to experience new things. This can make them more enjoyable company and more likely to have a good time.

In conclusion, young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people are. This is due to their optimism, their activity level, and their open-mindedness.

"If my principal has decided that all students had to participate in an extracurricular activity I would disagree with the decision of him or her. All students should have the right to chose to participate in an after or before school activity.

First and for most, an extracurricular activity is something you would do after or before school. If you have something after school say like a family reunion or, a game for another team the people or student's involved in the extracurricular would have trouble committing to the program.

Second, If a family or just the student's had more important stuff to do. Like going home to help the family or, take care of his or her brother or sister because the mom and dad are working late and to, even provide company and care for the family. The extracurricular activity is stopping them to provide support for their family and thank their mom and dad for working so hard every dad just to let me have my siblings.

Third, Students serve seven hours of school five days a week for the whole year if we were to add the extracurricular activity after school every day students could be going from seven hours of school to eight hours of school. Instead, students should be able to go home and do their homework then could play video game's or go outside and explore or go play waffle ball. How would students enjoy taking one hour out of their free time to do an extracurricular activity then enjoy time with their friend's. My point is extra hours of school is wasting their childhood.

In Conclusion, extracurricular activities will cause people to miss out on stuff even if some of that stuff is not really that important. School in total takes a way some of are childhood and if we add extra time on to that it will fly by. If you do not agree with me then that is OK because we don't need extra after school activity's.  ",0,771
"Title: The Unseen Benefits of Limiting Car Usage 

An intelligent shift in our societal perspective on vehicle utilization is a necessary step in creating a healthier, more sustainable environment. Limiting car usage offers copious advantages that go beyond addressing the urgent issue of global climate change. The implementation of car-free zones in cities like Vauban, Germany, and the establishment of car-free days in Bogotá, Colombia, spotlight the potential of alternatives to the prevalent car culture currently dominating urban landscapes worldwide.

A conscious effort to reduce car usage not only minimizes greenhouse gas emissions, hence curbing climate change efforts, but it also promotes healthier lifestyles and fosters a more communal living atmosphere. The transformative experiment in Vauban has proved car-free suburban life to be both practical and beneficial. With limited parking areas and a pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, Vauban's initiative has resulted in 70 percent of families forgoing ownership of vehicles and enjoying decreased stress levels (Rosenthal). The echo of bicycle wheels and lively, untroubled children replacing roaring engines and honking horns is testimony to the drastically improved quality of life in this suburban enclave. 

Furthermore, the adoption of public transport in place of private vehicles can reduce air pollution exponentially. Paris's temporary driving ban due to hazardous pollution levels is a stern reminder of the environmental implications of our over-dependence on automobiles (Duffer). Transportation companies, recognizing this, are rebranding themselves as “mobility” companies with a wider product range that accommodates alternatives such as public transit, car sharing initiatives, and cycling (Rosenthal).

Cities around the globe, like Bogotá, taking up the challenge of hosting car-free days, provide us with tangible evidence of the feasible and beneficial alternatives to our car-centric lifestyle. The event, initiated to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, witnessed a positive response despite inclement weather conditions (Silky). This initiative complements the ongoing efforts to restructure our built environment to be more accommodating of pedestrian and bicycle movement, including the construction of larger sidewalks and bicycle paths.

Limiting car usage also encourages a shift in our cultural perception of cars from a symbol of freedom and status to just another mode of transportation. With the rise of car-pooling apps and public transit, the younger generations are gradually distancing themselves from the conventional idea of car ownership and driving, favoring public transport, walking, or cycling. The decreasing interest of the millennials in car ownership represents a potential cultural shift, which holds promises for a more sustainable future for our cities (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car use are far and wide. It promises cleaner air, healthier lifestyles, more vibrant communities, and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. With careful planning and implementation, the transition from a car-dependent society to a more sustainable, car-free one is not only possible but also beneficial in so many ways. Changing our attitude towards automobiles, embracing public transportation, and encouraging walking or cycling as means for short-distance commuting, could herald an era which distances itself from the harmful effects of car culture.",1,772

People could know how family member and friends felt before they past away. What if we could know how animals felt with the FACS?

We don't know how people felt back then, we didn't know what they were going through, but with the FACS we could get a general idea of how they felt at that time in there life. Say you had a family member that passed away that you never met before, but you want to know if they were a happy, sad, or mad person you could use the FACS to know so you don't have to hear it from someone else.

"Zoos have been a source of entertainment and education for many years, but their role in conservation and education has been a topic of debate. While some argue that zoos play a vital role in the conservation of endangered species and education of the public, others believe that they are unethical and serve no purpose. In my opinion, the continued operation of zoos is necessary for the conservation of endangered species and education of the public.

Firstly, zoos play a crucial role in the conservation of endangered species. They provide a safe and controlled environment for animals to breed and raise their young, which helps to increase their populations. This is especially important for species that are on the brink of extinction. For example, the giant panda is an endangered species that has been successfully bred in zoos and has been reintroduced into the wild. Without zoos, it is unlikely that this species would have survived. Additionally, zoos also provide a safe haven for animals that are injured or orphaned in the wild and cannot survive on their own.

Secondly, zoos are an important tool for education. They provide a unique opportunity for people to learn about animals and their habitats. By seeing animals up close and personal, people are more likely to develop an appreciation and respect for them. This can lead to a greater understanding of the importance of conservation and the need to protect these animals and their habitats. For example, many zoos have educational programs that teach children about the importance of recycling and how it affects the environment. These programs help to educate the next generation of conservationists and environmentalists.

Furthermore, zoos also provide an opportunity for scientists to study animals in a controlled environment. This allows them to gather information that would be impossible to obtain in the wild. For example, scientists have studied the behavior of primates in zoos, which has led to a greater understanding of their social structures and behavior. This knowledge can be used to develop conservation strategies that are tailored to the specific needs of each species.

However, there are also arguments against the continued operation of zoos. Some people believe that keeping animals in captivity is unethical and that it is wrong to use animals for human entertainment. They argue that zoos are prisons for animals and that they should be free to roam in their natural habitats. While these concerns are valid, they do not take into account the conservation and educational benefits that zoos provide.

In conclusion, the continued operation of zoos is necessary for the conservation of endangered species and education of the public. While there are some drawbacks to keeping animals in captivity, the benefits that zoos provide far outweigh the negatives. By providing a safe and controlled environment for animals to breed and raise their young, educating the public about the importance of conservation, and providing opportunities for scientists to study animals, zoos play a vital role in the protection and preservation of our planet's biodiversity.",1,774
"I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality. It is found for me that I can be myself in a world. I'm thinking that the world is trying to make me who I am and make me see. The way I am can make me do whatever I want to do. I could visit wonderful places like seeing great nature, going into a big forest, and go see big hills. This would be amazing to see wonderful things.

I can be myself in a world when it is constantly trying to make me something seeing things like a place to see nature. Sometimes in some places to see nature is amazing. Seeing nature like seeing different kinds flowers, and seeing and beautiful. I will also go to see the blossom trees. Those would be interesting for me to see those kinds of Nature.

I would think about in a world, and it would constantly make me something else when seeing nature a big forest. Going into the forest usually it is just trees, but when I see something new in the forest, it would be very interesting. I would see in the forest that the life is changing. Also, I would see fresh fruit growing from the trees. And also I would see a beautiful area with flower bushes.

Sometimes I think in a world that makes me something else wants me to see everything. This can maybe explain that I am on top of a mountain or a hill. Hills would be better for me because I just only want to see a high view of the land, with the mountains it is too cold and windy. When I see big hills usually it is just grass. Going up to the top of a big hill and When I see that this land is clear, this may explain that there's only a plain grass area with trees, this is similar to the past a long time ago.

It is good for me to be who I am, and being myself in a world. This may explain almost everything. Saying that I disagree with this statement thinking that It doesn't seem very interesting, it may feel like Emerson's statement doesn't make any scents. For me this statement makes scents, because it does describe the world that is trying to make me something else about the greatest accomplishments.

"Hello, my name is PROPER_NAME, a freshman at SCHOOL_NAME. It is much appreciated that you took time out of your busy schedule to read this. This letter is in regard to the Electoral College. There have been many ongoing disputes on whether we should keep the Electoral College in order to elect the President. It is felt that the Electoral College is not the way to go when it comes to voting for the President. The reasons being for this is that the Electoral College doesn't truly represent the people, and it doesn't allow everyone to know the true facts about each candidate.

First, the Electoral College does not represent everyone truly. The Electoral College is overall risky. It is stated by Bradford Plume from the passage, ""The Indefensible Electoral College..."" , that there were several incidents regarding corrupt electors who did not fulfill the popular vote of their state. He stated the incident in the 1960s, when the Louisiana legislature almost replaced Democratic electors, in order to not have the popular vote go to Kennedy. Electors can also choose who to vote for and have no care in whom the public votes for. Why risk giving your voice to people who are shady, untrustworthy, and won't care for your opinion? Furthermore, in the passage of ""What Is the Electoral College?"" , that most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system. However, in Maine and Nebraska, they use a system similar to ""proportional representation"". Why would the USA need this in order to choose a President? Why can't things all be the same?

Secondly, the Electoral College does not give everyone a chance to know the candidates a little better. In the passage, ""In Defense of the Electoral College:..."" , he states that candidates focus more on swing states instead of all the states in general. This strategy creates a problem for those who want to listen and get to know who the candidates are, but live in states that don't get visited. Which in turn, doesn't allow the public to get to know who they are. Another problem is that when the popular vote is lost in a state, those who lost no longer have a say in the election. Why have your vote squandered to the majority when you can have a direct election that will always give you a voice in your country?

To conclude, the Electoral College isn't the greatest way to pick a President. The Electoral College should be abolished for it does not always honestly voice the public, and does not give everyone to the same opportunity to understand a candidate's motives. The Electoral College may give a clear winner and is less time consuming, but are we working towards a speedy election? Or towards what the people want? Over 60 percent of registered voters prefer a direct election. Which would you prefer Mr.",0,776
"I will explain the advantages of limiting car usage. I hope you enjoy this essay.

Limiting car usage definitely has its advantages. You can for one, limit pollution in the air. Fewer cars on the roads, = less gas to go into the air. Less gas in the air, = better breathing for citizens. We all could use some better air for breathing.

Some people prefer walking besides cars because of the dangers of getting hit.

Kids could be walking in the street, not paying attention to anything but themselves, and get hit. That can't happen if their city limits' car usage! Limiting car usage saves lives! You could walk more safely, without having to worry if the driver is stupid and going to hit you!

Another reason limiting car usage is good is, Drunk Drivers. If you limit car usage, Drunk Drivers are limited as well, decreasing accidents, deaths, etc. We all know that less Drunk Drivers = a safe community. No one wants to be a victim of a drunk driver accident.

To conclude, these are my reasons for why I think limiting car usage is good. It decreases pollution, decreases accidents with kids getting hit, and limits deaths from drunk driving. Thank you for reading this essay.  ",0,777
"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with this statement for a few reasons. First, many advertisements use attractive models to sell products. The models are usually airbrushed to look perfect, which gives the product an unrealistic image. Second, advertisers often use catchy phrases to make their products seem more appealing. For example, a shampoo commercial might say that the product will make your hair “silky smooth.” However, this is not always the case. Third, some ads use before-and-after photos to show how effective a product is. However, these photos are often doctored or taken under special lighting conditions.

"If I was a scientist at NASA, and I was discussing the Face with someone who's beliefs were that the face was created by an alien, I would tell them it was created by a landform because, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, the MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, and it was just a natural landform, A person part of the MOC said that when he saw the Face, it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and, when scientists first saw the Face, they figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia.

First, when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, they snapped a picture that was ten times sharper then the original photos from the Viking, and it turned out just to be a natural landform. But people were not satisfied, they were saying that the camera on board had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face, maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze.

"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom is valuable but should be implemented carefully. On one hand, this technology could help teachers gain insights into how students are feeling about their lessons. If a class appears disengaged or frustrated, teachers could adjust their teaching approach to better connect with students. Identifying specific students who are struggling with understanding or experiencing other issues would allow teachers to provide additional support as needed. However, this technology also raises valid privacy and ethical concerns. Continually monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent could undermine their sense of privacy and autonomy at school. It may also lead to misinterpreting a student's emotional state or make them feel self-conscious about expressing themselves naturally. Therefore, if used, guidelines would need to be established around only occasional and selective use of this technology with student consent. Opt-in programs that allow families to choose whether their children participate could balance these considerations. With proper safeguards and oversight on its application in the classroom, FACS technology shows potential to improve education by giving teachers a helpful tool for student insight and support. But its use also warrants careful discussion due to legitimate concerns around student privacy, autonomy and well-being.

"My Seagoing Adventures 

Growing up on a ranch in rural Kansas, I always dreamed of seeing what lay beyond the wide open plains. When I learned about the Seagoing Cowboys program from a friend, I saw it as my chance to escape everyday life and embark on an exciting journey. This program allowed me to experience more than I ever imagined, and I would encourage anyone with a spirit of adventure to join us on the high seas.

Being out on the water for months at a time presented amazing opportunities to visit new places and meet all sorts of people, from fishermen in Dutch Harbor to scientists in the Bering Sea. The article detailed my travels to Alaska, where I helped with research projects amid stunning landscapes covered in snow and ice. I even got to interact with seals and seabirds up close during our stops at remote islands. These unforgettable encounters with nature and cultures very different from my own back home truly opened my eyes to the vast diversity of our world. 

In addition to experiencing new destinations, participating in the program also allowed me to learn important skills. On the boats, I assisted with tasks like sailing, navigation, and maintenance that have proven useful in my daily life. Facing challenges like twenty-foot waves in the Bering Sea taught me all about perseverance and teamwork. I gained self-assurance from knowing that I could adapt to unpredictable conditions far from familiar shores. Overall, the hands-on activities through Seagoing Cowboys helped me grow in capability and confidence in myself.

My time with the program was short but left me with lifelong memories and confidence to take on future challenges. I believe that any adventurous spirit could greatly benefit from the opportunities the Seagoing Cowboys provides to see this wonderful planet up close and become a more well-rounded, experienced person. I know joining them opened my eyes to the possibilities outside my small town life and helped set me on a path I never could have imagined. For seeking adventure on the open water and a chance to discover your hidden strengths, I recommend applying for this once-in-a-lifetime experience.",1,783

"Cars have become an essential part of our daily lives. They provide us with the convenience of traveling from one place to another quickly and comfortably. However, excessive use of cars can have negative impacts on our environment and health. Therefore, it is essential to limit car usage to enjoy the advantages of a car-free lifestyle.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is reducing air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which are detrimental to human health and the environment. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution causes seven million premature deaths every year. Limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution, leading to better health outcomes and a cleaner environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is promoting physical activity. Walking, cycling, or using public transportation instead of driving can encourage people to be more physically active. Exercise has numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Furthermore, active transportation can also save money on gas and car maintenance.

Additionally, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion. Cars are a leading cause of traffic jams, which can cause stress and frustration for drivers and passengers. Traffic congestion also increases travel time, leading to lost productivity and economic costs. Promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transportation or carpooling, can help reduce traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of transportation systems.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society. It can reduce air pollution, promote physical activity, and alleviate traffic congestion. Therefore, it is crucial to consider alternative modes of transportation and limit car usage to enjoy a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. Let us all work together to create a cleaner and healthier environment for ourselves and future generations.",1,785
"Cars are almost everywhere, And as they say ''Where ever there's a car, There is solution''. Well that's not what they actually say but that's what they should be said. I mean can you just imaging the gases and smoke coming out of just one car, Its a lot right well now picture a country full of cars and trucks now that's cause for damage. Limliting car use can have advantages on the world and ourself as a person. One city in Germany is making a change for the better.

In LABAN, Germany population of just about 5,500 people, About 70 percent of the people there do not own cars as said in source three of the article, It also states that 57 percent of people sold there cars to move and live there. This plays a part in the advantage of less air solution, ''Fresh air'' when people say I need some fresh air he's not really breathing fresh air unless he's sniffing a tree tarts has just gone to photosynthesis. Not to mention the gas, In VAUBAN instead of having to use the gas for cars it can be used for other day-to-day things. Although there is less solution in VAUBAN it is nothing compared to the air solution that has already been let out but to make things better we all have to start somewhere.

Less air solution is good, but it might take years before we can implement a law or rule to have fewer cars around the world. Something good that you can get out of not having a car right off the bat is less stress and being calm.''

And if you're using your phone while driving, it's like, way more likely that you'll get angry at someone else and like, do something stupid or aggressive or whatever. And that's just not good for anyone, you know?

So yeah, drivers should def not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. It's like, just way too dangerous and stuff, and it's not worth the risk. Just put your phone away and drive safely, you know? It's like, common sense, duh.",1,787
"I am going to try to convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

It is a fun job to have.

You get to see the world.

You can have fun on the ship on the ride home after you delivered the cattle.

You will have many friends to ride with you so you will never have a bad time.

Now I am going to try and convince you to join.

A reason for you to join the seagoing Cowboys is it is a very fun job.

You get to do whatever you want after the cattle are taken care of.

You can play games with the other people.

Furthermore, you can play cards.

Furthermore, you can even play baseball after the cattle are dropped off.

Furthermore, you will have many people on board the ship.

Furthermore, you may not know them, but you can make friends.

It would be fun, and you would definitely not be alone.

If you had friends on the ship you could have fun all the time.

You could play all kinds of fun games with the people on board the ship.

After you drop off the cattle food and supplies what are you going to do.

Well all that space that the animals were in is now open for baseball game.

That's right you could play a baseball game on a ship like that.

Just don't hit a home run too far.

You could play games, read, and even play a baseball game and who says that isn't fun.

Another good thing about Seagoing Cowboys is that you can see amazing sights.

You could ride past China.

You could almost go anywhere you wanted, after the cattle were dropped off.

Sightseeing is a very fun thing to do.

You can see stuff you have never seen before.

I think it would be kind of fun to be a seagoing cowboy out would miss your relatives though.

Remember why being a seagoing cowboy is fun.

The job is a fun amazing job.

You will have friends on board.

The ride home will be amazing.

There would be a lot of sightseeing on the trip.

Those are the reasons you should be a seagoing cowboy.",0,788
"If you think the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you're out of your mind. Aliens didn't create the Face, it's just a huge rock formation. In fact, the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.

The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Gavin says it's about the same height as the Face on Mars, which shows that the Face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte.

When the picture of the Face was posted on a JPL website, it revealed a natural landform. Many people believed there was no alien monument after all.

So in conclusion, there are many reasons why the Face is a natural landform. The theory of the Face being created by aliens is inaccurate.",0,789
"Dear Principal,

I think your decision on whether all students on doing community service should be a yes. I think this because everywhere you go is always so dirty, and community service won't hurt anyone, it will actually help someone.

Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside your house there's a piece of trash, and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better. That is what I think about everybody doing some community service around here.  ",0,790
"My principal has just made an incredibly bold move, something that has never been done before in my school's history. Starting now, all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Many students are mad, many don't care, and few are supportive. It does seem unfair for the school to decide your life outside of school, doesn't it? Well, although it does seem controlling for the school to do this, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help a student's resume in the future, help students make friends, and help students find their passions.

Starting off, I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity can help a student's resume. When you apply for your first couple of jobs, the employers do want to see you are doing well in school, but also want to know what you are doing outside of school. The activities someone does in their free time can really show a business the person's character. If employers see that the person was on a sports team or in a music group, they know they are good with working with others. If an employer sees the person was on the student council, they know they are a good leader. If they do volunteer work, employers know that the person is kind, and will always be willing to help someone out. All of these traits are great to have when working, and will make it more likely that you are hired.

The second reason I think students should do an extracurricular activity is because it can help them make friends. A lot of students in middle school deal with the issue of being left out. Either their friends from elementary school have moved away, or they have drifted apart over the years. Whatever the case is, having no friends makes it hard for you to get to know people. Normally, these students are viewed as outsiders, and a lot of people try to avoid talking or interacting with them. However, there is a solution, just not an easy one for someone that doesn't normally talk with other people. Joining an extracurricular activity can help students meet new friends. People in their group or team might be more willing to be friends, since they know the student better now from playing with them or working with them. Plus, everyone has something in common. To sum it up, extracurricular activities can help lonelier students meet new people and make friends.

The last reason I think students should do an extracurricular activity is because it can help people find their passions. I believe everyone has a passion, but it is difficult for people to find theirs. However, being forced to try a new activity such as a musical instrument or sports can help someone find what they truly enjoy, and I have a real life example to prove it. When I was younger I used to try all sorts of sports, baseball, soccer, basketball, etc. They were all alright, but none were ever really exciting for me. Then, my parents signed me up for swimming, something I thought was ridiculous. If I didn't find sprinting down a field and dodging other kids exciting, how would I get through a summer of gliding in the water? Though interestingly, swimming turned out to be my passion. I do believe that the reason I liked swimming so much was because of how positive the environment was. In the other sports my teammates were very pressuring, and if I made a small mistake, I would be yelled at. However, swimming wasn't like that at all. I could swim great, alright, or horrible and my teammates would still congratulate me for trying my best and working hard. Though remember, I found my passion for swimming by being forced to try it. I believe that if I wasn't pushed out of that stage of defeat I was in, I still wouldn't have found out what I truly enjoyed doing. That is why I think being forced to do an extracurricular activity can help students find their passions.

To sum it all up, I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can show their positive traits to employers, help lonelier students find friends with similar interests, and push students to try something new and maybe find their passion. Leadership, kindness, and being social are all great traits that employers can see someone has, depending on what extracurricular activities they do. If a student who normally doesn't have any friends joins a team or group, they can find people with they same interests, and finally feel accepted. Lastly, if a student has given up on extracurricular activities because of a few bad experiences, they can be pushed outside their comfort zone, and maybe finally find something they really enjoy. In conclusion, you are only a kid once and when it is all over, it's hard for you to join a sports team or music group as an adult. Doing these activities at a young age can help you find a hobby or a passion, maybe you will make some friends, and when you enter the real world, you'll have a resume that shows business's that you will work hard and make a great employee.",0,791
"As I began my journey in school, I tried to take advantage of all the resources it had to offer.

With a positive mindset and an eagerness to learn, I embraced all these opportunities and used them to develop new skills and become a better version of myself.",1,792
"Is keeping the Electoral College a good ideal Mr/ms senator? Well if you ask me I say no. Why have it? Say the article voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors but who elect the president. Because of the wine takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters, and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the President of the United States would be best.

To begin with Having popular votes instead of keeping the electoral college will be better because keeping it will only cause more trouble I say. Why? Well the electoral college is known for being the ""Disaster Factor"" Sad cause not only they have a bad name for there self the Americans are also most worried about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Because of the focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states candidates hardly or mostly don't have time to put up any campaign ads. The stress of working about the electoral college can be tough, they don't even have to put any signs or ads. Crazy because it's just this one process that's only counting of the electron votes for congress.

In conclusion the Electoral College consists of 538 electoral. Say the article only 270 electoral are required to elect the president. In the article the system allows for much worse, but wrote as the election crisis in a century? Well I think so! Not even think I know so. Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cased a deciding vote for whomever they please. It's all happening, everything I said in the beginning...about the trouble. Why the senate gets to choose the vice president? Why can't the qualified citizens choose for there selves. That whole area needs some adjustments before they start choosing for people.  ",0,793
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

How can this B average be taken care of?

I think what you have recommend is out of the question.

We as the students can hardly maintain a C average as it is.

I am here to speak up on this selfish idea.

First, many children have a hard time keeping up in class to have a b average just to play something that they desire to play. Second, how can we keep up with sports homework and maintaining a b average.

Last but not least, how we have a lot of things to worry about at home and then an another plate is on our shoulders. How can we do all this at once first, many children have a hard time keeping up in class to have a B average just to play a game they desire to play. I have a b in language arts that I trying to keep up with and, doing cheer leading is hard enough. How would you feel if someone told you that you have to do something that is difficult enough to maintain. Trust me I trying my best with this new rule you just came up with. How can I do this with no help?

Second, how can we keep up with sports homework and maintaining a B average. It not impossible its just unreasonable. If you think you can joggle each of the thing us kids are trying to do in our time you'll think oh they got us bet. Think about the little things y'all do to us waking up going to school doing class work go home do some homework and go to practice.

"Dear, Principal

If you make it required that students have a B average then many extracurricular activity's will drop drastically in population, some will even die off. You should not do this it will start a rebellion in the classrooms and our school will get worse and worse. If you think that this will pressure kids into doing more work and trying harder your wrong. Us kids are a bunch of lazy people today and if you do these things aren't going to change, they might even get worse. It is outrageous that you would think of doing this. Kids won't change their grades because of this. Anyway we will all be in high school next year anyway, and it is your school, so you can do what you want with it. This is just a warning, if you do this kids everywhere will resent you and this school will become one of the worst.

"Individuality is a crucial aspect of human life that allows us to express ourselves and stand out from the crowd. As an 8th grader, I have observed how individuality can be applied in present day life through various means, including personal experiences and literary works.

Firstly, I believe that my parents have played a significant role in shaping my individuality. They have always encouraged me to be myself and never conform to societal norms. For instance, they let me choose my own extracurricular activities, such as playing the guitar and painting, which helped me discover my hidden talents and interests. These experiences have taught me the importance of embracing my uniqueness and not being afraid to be different.

Moreover, I have made individual decisions that have helped me express my individuality. For example, when I started working, I chose to take on a job that aligns with my interests and values, rather than following the conventional path of studying medicine or engineering. This decision has allowed me to pursue my passion and make a living doing something I love.

In addition, I find inspiration from authors who have explored the concept of individuality in their works. For instance, Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" and its literary adaptation ""Maria Magdalena"" showcase the importance of individuality through the character of Sophie Never, who is a brilliant cryptologist and code breaker. Her unique skills and perspectives help solve complex puzzles and uncover hidden secrets, demonstrating the value of individuality in problem-solving and innovation.

Historic events, such as the French Revolution and the Civil Rights Movement, also highlight the significance of individuality. These movements were fueled by individuals who refused to accept the status quo and fought for their rights and freedoms. Their courage and determination inspired others to stand up for their beliefs and fight for their rights, leading to significant social and political changes.

In conclusion, individuality is a vital aspect of human life that allows us to express ourselves and make a difference in the world. Through personal experiences, literary works, and historical events, we can see the importance of embracing our uniqueness and standing up for what we believe in. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and diverse society where everyone can thrive and",1,796
" Technology has had a profound impact on our society, bringing about numerous advancements in various fields. From healthcare to transportation, technology has revolutionized the way we live and work. However, with these advancements come challenges and potential risks.

One of the most significant advantages of technology is its ability to improve efficiency and productivity. With the help of machines and software, tasks that used to take hours or days can now be completed in a matter of minutes. This has led to increased productivity and profitability in businesses, as well as more time for individuals to pursue personal interests.

Another advantage of technology is its ability to connect people from all over the world. Social media platforms and messaging apps have made it possible for people to communicate with friends and family members from anywhere, at any time. This has facilitated global communication and collaboration, allowing for the exchange of ideas and knowledge on a global scale.

However, with these advantages come potential risks. One of the biggest challenges of technology is the potential for misuse. Cyberattacks, hacking, and other forms of online crime can have devastating consequences for individuals and businesses alike. Additionally, the constant exposure to screens and electronic devices can lead to negative health effects, such as eye strain and poor posture.

Furthermore, technology can also have a negative impact on our social lives. Spending too much time on screens can lead to social isolation and decreased face-to-face interaction. Additionally, the constant bombardment of information and news can lead to information overload and a lack of critical thinking skills.

In conclusion, while technology has brought about numerous advantages, it also presents challenges and potential risks. It is important to be aware of these risks and take steps to mitigate them, while also embracing the benefits of technology and using it in responsible and ethical ways.",1,797
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe it is important to give back to the community and help improve the environment. In light of this, I have decided to organize a community service project to clean up the local park. The park is a popular gathering place for families, and it is disheartening to see how it has become dirty and unkempt.

The first step in implementing this project is to gather a group of volunteers. I will reach out to my friends, family, and classmates to see if they are interested in participating. I will also post about the project on social media to attract more volunteers. Once I have a sufficient number of volunteers, we will meet to discuss the details of the project and how we can work together to achieve our goal.

The next step will be to gather the necessary resources. We will need gloves, trash bags, and cleaning supplies such as brooms, hoes, and rakes. We may also need to rent a dumpster if the amount of trash we collect is too large for our regular trash cans. Additionally, we will need to inform the local park authorities about our project and obtain any necessary permits.

On the day of the project, we will meet at the park early in the morning and begin our cleanup efforts. We will start by picking up litter and trash from the park, followed by cleaning up any debris or trash that may have accumulated in the park's ponds or water features. We will also work to remove any weeds or overgrown vegetation that may be obstructing the park's pathways or making it difficult for visitors to navigate the park.

Once we have completed our cleanup efforts, we will take a break to enjoy a picnic lunch and reflect on our work. We will also take the time to thank our volunteers for their hard work and dedication to the project.

In conclusion, organizing a community service project to improve the environment is a noble cause that requires hard work and dedication. By gathering a group of volunteers, obtaining the necessary resources, and working together to clean up the local park, we can make a positive impact on our community and help to preserve our natural resources for future generations.",1,798
"Have you ever considered online school? Some schools are offering an online option for students via video conference or online course. Online school has many benefits allowing students to learn to disregard the weather, allows students and staff to have more learning and free time, and students can re-watch the video classes allowing the students to go at their own pace or if they do not completely understand the material.

Some argue that online school would make it harder to ask teachers questions but, teachers and students would have more free time and learning time due to not having to take the bus or any transportation. Furthermore, if you were to subtract the time it takes to get to school and back and the time it takes to walk to classes you would have more time to ask questions and have more potential learning time with the teachers. This is important because it allows students to take more time learning and ask more question and classes would be less rushed.

Another benefit of online school is the fact that students can learn disregarding the weather or if they are sick. For example if a student is sick they can still attend class from home and not miss a day of school. Another example if there is a snow day the entire county can still learn and not be held behind due to weather.

Another benefit of online classes would be that it allows students to re-watch video lessons and fully understand the lessons. Some students may have trouble fully understanding the material at fast paces but, online classes would allow the student to re-watch the material and can spend extra time on certain subjects that they have difficulty in. For example if a student has trouble in math because they need more time or has forgotten the material they can review the class again.

In conclusion online school and courses has many benefits and could improve learning and allow students to fully understand material and provides more time for learning and questions. Online school also allows students to learn on snow days prevents students and staff from falling behind on material. I advise students to propose the idea of online school or have a discussion with your school administrators because online school and courses holds many benefits.",0,799
"The culture of the cars is an easier way of transportation for the people, yet do the people know that these cars are space consumers and cause smog in most areas of the world. By just reducing the amount of cars in various locations the amount of space would increase the therefore make town or city more accessible for the large population. This change of culture may benefit the population by just having the public transportation and biking.

To begin with the space consuming in suburbs makes it hard most people make a living in the tight area and having the certain parking areas may be the only way to have the space needed to get to where they need to be, yet it's all timed. This makes people more tense when they had to worry of a parking spot. The people in Germany weren't allowed to park the sides of the road and have driveways unless they paid an extra $40,000 along with a home. As said the text Laban, had completed a trend of separating the car use from the suburban life, this is what they called the 'smart planning'. Also to include that other areas of the world such as Beijing, China, has to worry more the amount of smog polluting their air and making people ill. In Paris, France, diesel fuel was blamed for the pollution because most of the cars were made up of this fuel. They were rank the most polluted area compared to other locations. Therefore, to reduce the amount of the complaints of the lack of space and pollution the want to either rid of the cars or just buy more plug-in-cars and hybrids for cleaner air.

Not to mention, that in Bogotá, Colombia they completely banned the cars from their country for a day to promote an alternative transportation and reduce the smog. The violators are faced $25 fines. As said the text, the stress level has dropped and therefore has Sadat easier for the people to more around and not get so aggravated. The authorities from other countries came to the event to see what they had in store for the program, and as said in the text the authorities say that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders. And in the United States, President Obama has ""ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Americans are buying fewer cars and are getting fewer licenses. By creating a new network that has the pedestrians have bicycles, private cars and commercial and public transportation. This to show time saved, conserved resources, lower emissions and improve safety. By not just completely getting rid of cars but just reducing it, it may help them to have more smooth system.

To conclude this, the culture of cars has been an issue for some years and in some areas very difficult to handle therefore they have created a more efficient way to make life easier for most people. The world has to reduce the smog and increase the space for more compact living and larger populations. By not to get rid of the culture car completely but to just reduce it can be beneficial to the people and the world.",0,800
"I'm here to tell you that the face on Mars is not the face to a martian, but there is always both sides to a situation like this. I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exist on both sides. My side is that the face on Mars could be seen wrong, it could be a pile of rocks, and there are many weird things on this planet with weird shapes, it can't always be martians or aliens.

So to start this off it could be an alien, but there is a strong possibility that It's not either. First the face is way to large to be an actual face, it says it the article it is measured in meters, that's almost impossible. It also says in the article that the face on Mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face. If you look further into the article it says that every time they went across the planet that it looked exactly the same.

It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not. There is also strong evidence on both sides, but NASA has a lot of proof that it isn't an alien, they could be hiding it, or they can be wrong.  ",0,801
"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research outdoor activities in my area and compare them based on cost, time commitment, and fun. I also had to think about why spending time with friends outdoors is so enjoyable and how they can make me feel comfortable. Here's what I found out:

First, there are so many cool outdoor activities to do in my area! You can go hiking, biking, kayaking, or even rock climbing. Each of these activities has its own cost, but they're all pretty affordable. Hiking is free, biking can be around $20 for a rental, kayaking is around $30 for a half-day trip, and rock climbing is around $40 for a session. So, it's pretty easy to find something that fits your budget.

The time commitment for each activity can also vary. Hiking can be as short as an hour or as long as a whole day, depending on how far you want to go. Biking and kayaking are usually around 2-3 hours long, and rock climbing can be anywhere from 1-2 hours. So, you can choose how much time you want to dedicate to each activity.

But the best part about spending time with friends outdoors is how fun it is! Being in nature and doing something adventurous with your friends can be so much more enjoyable than just hanging out at home. You get to explore new places, challenge yourselves, and push your limits. Plus, you get to spend time with your friends and make memories that will last a lifetime.

And let's not forget how spending time with friends outdoors can make you feel comfortable. When you're doing something you love with people you care about, it's easy to forget about your worries and just enjoy the moment. You can talk about anything and everything, and just be yourself. It's like a big ol' stress relief.

So, in conclusion, spending time with friends outdoors is super fun and beneficial. It's a great way to get some exercise, explore new places, and spend time with the people you care about. And, let's be real, it's just a",1,802

"The legalization of marijuana has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that it should be legalized, while others think that it should remain illegal. In my opinion, marijuana should not be legalized.

Firstly, marijuana is a drug and just like other drugs, it can be addictive. If it is legalized, it will become more accessible to the public, which means that more people will have the opportunity to try it. This could lead to an increase in the number of people who become addicted to the drug. Addiction can be a serious problem, and it can lead to other issues such as financial problems, job loss, and even criminal activity.

Secondly, marijuana can have negative effects on a person's health. It can cause problems with memory, concentration, and coordination. It can also affect a person's ability to think clearly and make good decisions. In addition, marijuana smoke can be just as harmful as tobacco smoke and can lead to health problems such as lung cancer and respiratory infections.

Thirdly, legalizing marijuana could lead to an increase in crime. If marijuana is legalized, it will become easier for people to obtain it. This could lead to an increase in the number of people who drive under the influence of the drug, which could result in more accidents on the road. It could also lead to an increase in drug-related crime as people may resort to illegal activities in order to obtain the drug.

In conclusion, I believe that marijuana should not be legalized. It is a drug that can be addictive, harmful to a person's health, and could lead to an increase in crime. We should focus on educating people about the dangers of drug use and promoting healthy alternatives to drug use. By doing so, we can help reduce the number of people who become addicted to drugs and keep our communities safe.",1,804
"Do you want to live in a place where the air is polluted? Somewhere it is hard to breath. The earth would be a cleaner and more efficient place to live if we limit the everyday usage of cars. Just think about it by limiting the usage of cars you are saving money and making the earth a cleaner place. It's like the old saying goes ""kill two birds with one stone.

Who doesn't like having some extra money in their pockets to spend? I know I definitely do. By limiting the usage of cars people will no longer have to pay a car payment. Or even better have to pay these outrageous gas prices. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have BT law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" If we limit the usage of cars there won't be any reason to build new highways and the money can go to more important things.

Wouldn't you like to wake up in the morning, walk outside and get a wife of fresh clean air? Limiting car usage will also cut the amount of green house gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emotions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Cars are major contribution to the pollution we have in the air today. Having cleaner air makes the earth an all around better place. The people will be happier and the grass will be greener. ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London."" I don't know of any person on this earth that wants to breathe in particulate matter on a daily basis. ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo. This man is in his right mind. Solution is a major stressor for everyone. That's why I say by limiting car usage it will make people happier. People act like riding a bike is a bad thing. It's always good to get some exercise and be healthy.

If we aren't using cars there no reason to have highways. And if we don't have highways then cities be smaller."" But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in mall along some distant highway."" Where I grew up everything was close. There were restaurants less than a mile away. The mall was a 5minute bike ride. And school was only 10 minutes away. Everything was continent. I didn't have to get in the car and hope that it started it up. There was no waiting in traffic. All I had to do was hop on my bike and ride off.

If we stay at the rate we are going now the earth is going to turn in to a place that no one wants to live. So if we limit the usage of cars the earth will be an overall better place to live. If we don't drive there is less solution. If we don't have cars we don't need highways and the cities be more compact. And no cars means more money in our pockets. If that doesn't sound like a perfect place to live then I don't want to know what your idea of perfect is.  ",0,805

Maybe you're just trying to push them to be smarter, but taking away what the love isn't gone to push them just make them angry. Instead, you could give them an incentive, like when they win a game or make it to state throw them a pep all",0,806
"There is no definitive answer to this question as different people may have different opinions. Some people believe that speaking is more important for Chinese learners, while others believe that reading is more important. Either way, it is important to consider both skills when choosing which language to learn. A good way to start thinking about this is to ask yourself what tasks you need to completed in order to be proficient in one language, and then compare that to the tasks you need to complete in order to be proficient in another language. For example, if you are learning English as a second language, then you need to be able to understand and communicate with English-speaking people. However, if you are learning Mandarin, then you may not need to be able to understand English-speaking people, but you will need to be able to communicate with Mandarin-speaking people. In the same way, it is important to think about what tasks you need to complete in order to be proficient in one language and what tasks you need to complete in order to be proficient in another language. For example, if you are learning English as a second language and want to learn Mandarin, then you will need to be able to understand and communicate with Mandarin-speaking people. However, if you are learning English as a second language and want to learn Mandarin, and want to learn how to speak Mandarin, then you will need to complete tasks that are related to speaking Mandarin.

"Dear Mr. Principal,

I would like to let you know how I feel about your community service project.

I think helping the community is a great idea.

Furthermore, I would most certainly join in on this project.

Furthermore, I agree that you should require all students to participate in this project.

To me this isn't about what I want it's about what I can do for the community.

I would do anything anyone wanted me to do.

I could take out trash for an elder who couldn't get around very well or even walk dogs from the Humane society.

Students could do a lot for people in this community.

If some students didn't agree with you maybe they could help the community like once or twice a week.

I don't agree that they should have to do it every day unless they wanted to.

They need time to perform extracurricular activities and have time to do their school work.

Doing this project may help the promotion of Global Warning.

If we go and pick up trash along the beach or not putting pollution into the air, it will help the community a lot.

We can also do community service going to and elders house and helping them do something that they can't do anymore.

For example, we could help them clean the inside of their house.

Maybe they can't reach what is nasty.

We could fix up their yard.

Like trimming the bushes around their house or cutting the trees.

We could clean out the gutters from birds who have made nests in there.

They might think that it will be boring.

But I can promise them it will NOT be boring.

You will laugh and have fun, and even get a connection to the people you are helping.

I agree with you one-hundred percent!

You should make everyone do community service.

It will not only help the people you are helping, but yourself too.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0,808
"Wow, can you believe if you take a picture on your phone or social Mead it can tell you what your emotional are now that's pretty wild i don't care who you are.

My option for this topic I think It's pretty stupid because its none of there business what my emotional are and I'm sure others agree with me. Maybe they don't like to smile, but they sure can be happy my dad always told me never June a book its cover and that's what their doing.

I wouldn't like it because i don't want them to know what my emotions are because it's my emotion I will deal with them, i don't want to know one eyes to. In paragraph two it says"" can we actually calculate emotion like math homework"" emotions are not problems and just part of life you can't fix that the person who has the emotion problem if their sad or angry there the one that will fix.

There is one good thing about this emotional problem if someone takes a picture and there sad and there thinking about ending their lives someone can see it and contact someone, and they could change their lives around that's is on good thing I like it about.

"The driverless cars are coming. This is the greatest news ever. For technology and cars lovers and especially lazy people this is. But not just does people everyone generally. The world will love to over have to drive a car again.

I am for the aspects of driveless cars. They are many reasons for my decision. In paragraph 1, cofounder of Google Sergey Brin states that he believe such cars would fundamentally change the world. And Google has had cars that drive independently since 2009. In paragraph 2, it says ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" Which means that the car actually works. I honestly doubt that a human can drive half a million miles without a single crash. But these developments for self-driving cars was also back in the day. For example, in the late 1950s General Motors did radio signals. That read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. It also worked sparingly well. Since the late 1950s to now we are still using sensors. Google and many other company's have modified and developed automotive sensors. In the newer models of cars we have cameras that assist us. We have radar signal and GPS receivers. These developments and new technology are catching up and will go further.

For now law is the major issue, but soon they will be new laws added. These new laws will support this great new modern technology. In paragraph 10 it states ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved."" and also the final sentence ""But we grow closer to the destination every day."" And that is true, this is a great ideas and technology that we can't just let pass by us. Driverless cars are the future and they are coming.",0,810
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion being needed, I don't understand why students here should have to have a grade B average. Playing sports isn't really needing to have to be one a certain grade level, it's all about your fitness and how well you play for your school.

If I were a principal I wouldn't make people have good grades as they make you have now because it really isn't about how well your grades are it truly is all about your achievement. Playing sports isn't really ever on how well you do in your classes any who because it's a sport, you play it as a team, and if you aren't that good you do it to gain fitness and become tougher. I could sort of see why you have to have good grades thought just because whenever you're playing a sport it's with a school team, so therefor you have to be a good role model for your teammates rather than getting in trouble all the time and failing every single class. If you're a good player, then act and show as if you are one. If you aren't one, then try your best to show that you can do it!

I have always wondered why the ""policy"" has to be set on whether you're making a B average. In my opinion again I do not believe why this has to be this way, I could understand if you were failing because that's just not really exceptionable in my book. Other than not failing I believe you should be allowed to play because the only way I would ever say no is because of a failing F. That just gives not effort. If you passed without any F's then you should be able to play a sport because you still gave effort in what you were doing.",0,811
"Failure plays in the pursuit of success. Although some say that success shouldn't be consisted of failure because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner, actually failure plays in the pursuit of success because people fail, but they learn from their mistakes, and it's positively affecting people personalty.

Those who believes success shouldn't be consisted of failure have their reason. Some say failure may negatively affect people in their life. But, success makes people feel proud and enthusiasm. Because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner.

Failure helps people to find there a path to success. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes. For example, I took math test last week, and I didn't do well on the test. My score was 50 out of 100. So, I checked my test paper, and I saw what mistakes I got and learned from it. Then, I retook the test, and I got 91 out of 100, I was proud; after, I saw my score.

I know many people hate failing, they think it's negatively affecting their lives. But, failing is sometimes there are benefits because it's positively affecting people personality. Such as, hardworking, proud, and encourage. First, people have their dreams, some wants to be a football player, or some wants to be a president. They need to work hard to accomplish their dreams. Some people fail or success, but they are working hard to accomplish their dreams.

Lastly, pride and encouragement. For example, I have cousin who into sports, and he is in racetrack. There was a race in high school between Generic_School. So, my cousin was in it. He's family was there, and I was there, too. We saw the race, we were encouraging and cheering for him. So, he came in second place. I was mad at first, and I saw my cousin smiling. I told him, ""why are you smiling?"" He said,"" I'm happy that you guys came, to see me race."" he was so proud. I was happy for him. He didn't care if he is second or last. He cares about his relative cheering for him.

Conclusion, Failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe failure helps people to find there a path to success. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes, and it's positively affecting people personalty. Such as, hardworking, proud, and encourage",0,812
"UGH! ""I can't focus at school anymore now that grandma is gone. Nothing feels the same anymore. I just wish I could work on my own time!"" Said Generic_Name. Generic_Name, we will do something about this, I'm always here to help, said her father Generic_Name. Some schools offer distance learning as a way to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Do students benefit from being able to attend classes at home? I completely agree with this statement because it definitely can make an extraordinary change in one's students life for the better. Students would benefit from this massively since less pressure would be applied on them and weight would get lifted off their shoulders. Students would have their own time to work and can take various different approaches in this situation.

One of the many reasons why students would benefit at home is because they have better work ethic. Everyone works better at home rather than school because less pressure is on oneself to do amazing by strict teachers and bossy students. My close friend Generic_Name, was once offered to take some of her college classes online rather than getting up at 8am, stressing herself out early in the morning, but at home she took a couple classes at noon, and she gave in her best attempts than she had ever given at her early morning AP bio course. Another time, my brother Generic_Name, had been tutoring one of his classmates Generic_Name online. Now before they had been working at the local library and Generic_Name barely understood anything because of the noises and hyper teenage there, Now from the comfort of their own homes, they video called each other and Generic_Name started to go from 50s to 90s in just a week since he had a much better work ethic at home instead of in public with everyone around! Students do put in their best attempts and have a better work ethic at home freely rather than cramming themselves at school.

Next, a students mental health plays a very huge role in this topic. My loving sister, Generic_Name, had been diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety. She could barely force herself to wake up at 6 in the morning for school every day since it was very dreadful for her. Now when she switched from public school to online school, she was so much happier. I watched her eyes fill with joy and saw a bright light like I've never seen in my own sister in just a couple of weeks into online classes. She finally got to be herself again without all the judgmental students at school telling her horrific things every day and peer pressuring her to the max, she was finally happy and was back to getting all A's in no time. Another time, my cousin Generic_Name was so worn out from the stress from school and college apps, he had decided to take online classes for college in order to work on bettering himself as a person for his own health. Online classes brought Generic_Name outside the dark dungeon he was sitting in and changed his life for the better. Students would definitely benefit from taking online classes not only their grades, but as well as themselves, as a person.

Third, another way students benefit by taking classes from the benefit of their own home, is because they get to spend more time with their loved ones. Now while in school, we leave early in the morning without getting to see our parents and with sports, clubs and extracurricular activities, by the time one gets home it is already very late and one misses out on seeing they're parents since they are very busy with work as well. Now one of my good friends Generic_Name, lived with her grandma but was very busy with school and basketball practice and by the time she got home she was asleep, this continued on for 4 years, and once the time came, her grandma had unfortunately passed away. ""WOW"" If I wasn't always so busy with school and would've taken online classes, I would have much more time to spend with her. Now some may argue and disagree that students would not benefit from taking online classes due to most teens and adults are lazy and would never complete their work or assignments, but that statement is false because the ones who want to strive for the best and make better situations for themselves know how to manage their time properly and set goals for themselves in the future. There would be a drastic impact on students grades if they took online classes and would benefit in many ways.

In conclusion, there would be many positive results of distance learning. Now many may have heard of J. K Rowling, one of the best writers of the generation, she took many writing classes online which helped shape who she is today. She is known for being one of the best novelists today, and she did not have time to go to early morning classes, but instead she chased her dream of becoming a writer and had not gone UN noticed. Therefore, we can fix this issue by offering a variety of classes online for future students instead of forcing them at an unreasonable time and by letting students have a voice of their own to speak out. Students would see a great impact just by being able to attend classes from their own homes!  ",0,813
"Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This is valuable because a computer program could know how you are feeling, adjust your viewing program to make you happier with the program, and make you happier.

A computer program could know how you are feeling based on your facial expression. In the passage it states that, ""It's all about those muscular action units. They can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This shows that a computer program can tell how you are feeling even when you may try to hide it or force a smile.

The Facial Action Coding System could also adjust your program to make you happier with your program. For example, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that FACS is able to make the lesson into something you can enjoy. This can Improve grades and overall attitudes in classrooms.

The program can make you happier overall and allow you to succeed in school. It states in the passage, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them."" This shows that smiling can help you become happier. The program is made to allow you to feel certain emotions and adjusts the program based on your feelings. For example, if you are getting bored with the work that the program is providing it can alter the work to what you can feel more comfortable with.

FACS is valuable because a computer program can know how you feel, adjust your program to meet your needs, and make you happier. If we had this program this would allow more students to feel better about our learning, leading us to learn more. Also allow us to enjoy viewing ads, movies, TV, etc.",0,814
"The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read student emotions in the classroom remains a complex issue with reasonable perspectives on both sides. Supporters argue it could help teachers better understand how their teaching methods impact student engagement and learning. However, others raise fair privacy and social concerns that such monitoring could undermine trust in education. 

Proponents believe the technology could provide teachers valuable insight into whether students understand lessons or find them boring or confusing. Identifying emotions like confusion in real-time may help teachers adjust their approach to improve learning for all. Data on emotional responses to different teaching strategies over time could also guide curriculum decisions. Supporters view this as helping advance education through personalized, evidence-based methods informed by how students genuinely feel.

Skeptics counter that constantly monitoring student emotions may negatively impact the classroom environment. Students learning, and emotional development require a trusting relationship with teachers free from perception as subjects of surveillance. Many educational experts argue active, collaborative learning works best when students feel safe taking risks and making mistakes openly. Constant facial scanning risks making students self-conscious and less willing to actively engage for fear how they may appear on emotional readouts. 

There are also valid concerns about student privacy and data protection. Facial recognition technology is still being refined and flaws remain that could incorrectly interpret reactions. Detailed emotional profiles risk compounding biases if not carefully controlled and anonymized. Some argue the costs of losing student trust and discomfort with constant scrutiny outweigh potential benefits to teaching. Though well-intentioned to help students, the technology's drawbacks require serious consideration regarding its appropriate use to avoid unintended harms.

In the end, there are good-faith perspectives on both sides of this complex issue. If concerns about privacy, profiling and classroom environment are adequately addressed, emotion-scanning technology may modestly aid education when used judiciously and voluntarily. But more research is needed given its novel, unintended effects are still unknown. On balance, potential drawbacks currently appear to outweigh benefits for justifying its generalized usewithoutcareful study and consent.",1,815
"Dear Principal

I think that all students should not be required to perform community service. Because what if a student always has a lot of homework to do after school but has little time to do it so he or she would want a study hall during school so that they can finish their work in school, but if they have community service they would probably have little to no time to do their work, so they would rush threw it and do poorly on the assignment.

In other cases some student's might want to get home relax and just do stuff with their friends instead of working almost all day, but they can't because they would have community service. It's not bad it should just be optional for the people who want to do it and for the people who want to do it.

So that is why I do not support the idea of having community service for students t do.",0,816

Don't matter if we are young, we can learn everything. Some people think that the students can not identify a career by the time they enter to high school. Two years ago when I entered to high school

I was not sure what I want to be. Now, I know what I want to be, but that is thanks to my school that they have many ideas how we can identify a career. The last year I was in Internship class that was great because they give me the opportunity to get a job. The job was about secretary I was in love with this job; however, was not easy to learn, but I liked. I would like to be a secretary. It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because we can mature our mind, develop our skills, and develop our passions. We are students of high school, and we can identify a career and more many things.

To begin, When we learn about career we can start to mature our minds. Students in high school get experiences learn about how they can find a job. In Generic_School my school, we have Internship class. This class consist of help students to find a job, and they can see how to work in the community. Students develop their emotional knowledge; also, we start to proceed as adult. We learn that the work is a big responsibility. That's why we have to start to know about careers in high school. It is so important to identify what we want to do when we grow-up.

Additionally, develop our skills is a great idea that can help us. Many students learn many languages this is a great skill because we can travel everywhere, communicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak different languages we can earn more money, get a better job. We can develop many skills if we want. Just we need to try. If we want a great career we need to put in practice the discipline. We can do everything what we want because we are intelligent, positives,and great students. Keep going because that is the only way that we have.

Lastly, When we develop our passions we can get a good career. If we have something that would like to be for example: doctors, secretary, actors, or nurse whatever we want. I would like to say go head! We can do it. The life is a challenge if we don't try we can never get a good career. First step we need to face our fears. Second step we need to put all our efforts every day. Students in high school need to know these two steps. Students have all the capacity to learn everything, so let's go to do it.

To summarize, all the students should identify a career in high school. Students develop their emotional knowledge; also, we start to proceed as adult.

Many students learn many languages this is a great skill because we can travel everywhere, communicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak different languages we can earn more money, get a better job. Develop our skills is so important. The life is a challenge if we don't try we can never get a good career.

"The after-school homework club provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop academically and socially. It allows students to take initiative in their education, as they take part in organizing the club's activities and events, work together in small groups, and communicate with each other in order to get help and advice. Additionally, the club can be a great motivator as the environment encourages students to stay on top of their work. 

Three reasons to support the opening of an after-school homework club are as follows: 

Firstly, an after-school homework club provides a supportive setting for students to work in and provides an opportunity for students to receive help from one another. With experienced adults on hand, the club can also offer guidance on how to approach problems and foster a collaborative atmosphere that allows students to ask for advice and receive feedback in return. 

Secondly, it not only helps with schoolwork but offers the chance for personal growth. The club encourages developing problem-solving abilities, organizational skills, and increases communication skills through meeting with peers and discussing notes.

Finally, an after-school homework club offers a unique opportunity for students to socialize with their peers in a setting outside the classroom. This allows them to develop relationships in a setting without a grade at stake, as well as having fun when working collaboratively on projects. 

These three reasons are bolstered by the fact that an after-school homework club offers a unique environment to focus exclusively in study and practice, access to more resources for help, the opportunity to reach out to peers and gain support, and get ahead on any academic goals. It also helps to reduce student stress and promote discipline when it comes to time management. 

In sum, an after-school homework club provides opportunities to build academic skills, hone leadership skills, and increase social confidence. By offering a safe and structured space to work, it is an invaluable tool that could help students to achieve their full academic potential.",1,818
"Dear Principal,

I would like to thank u for reading this letter. I would personally prefer Policy 1, because if the students are responsible then they should be able to use there phones in free time such as lunch hour. Students should turn cell phones off in any hour of the day in which they are learning. If caught with phone on or still having the same texting conversations as lunch or previous periods then a proper form of punishment should be given. The reasons young adults should be given the choice to bring or not to bring their phones is because they need to know if you make a choice and get in trouble that they need to take the punishment.

Policy 2 is an unfair unlike Policy 1 which give us a choice. Policy 2 is like taking an agenda from a hardworking lawyer or doctor. It is something they need to make through the day just as young adults need their phones. Us using our phones help us keep in touch with our parents like on game days, and you are supposed to ride the bus and your parents need to find you. Now the phone usage on the bus is the same policy as the school. They always have those ""NO CELL PHONE USAGE"" signs up.

I am coming to you with this letter because I believe students should be allowed to bring their phones to school if they are smart with it. I would most certainly choice Policy 1 but this is just a letter to persuade you.

Again thank you for taking the time to read this letter and for considering Policy 1 in your school.

"Dear State Senator,

Many people go back and forth whether to keep the Electoral College or switching to popular vote to decide on who our President of the United States will be. The Electoral College just isn't a fair way in deciding who the President will be. Just because that accident won the Electoral College and not the most popular vote out of the whole country, does not mean that should be President.

The picture provided in source 3 shows a map of the ""breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state."" Throughout the map you can clearly see that each state does not have the same number of electoral votes as all the rest. When people go out to elect the President they have to understand that they might not be in control of that vote honestly counting. We basically aren't choosing the President we want. We are choosing the electors for that President who will be voting for you and the state. It's sad to see that even if a President does win the popular vote out of the whole country that they still, may not become President because of the Electoral College. It even says in source 2 paragraphs 9 ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" If more people are against the Electoral College then there must be a change.

Along with people feeling as if their vote doesn't matter, there could be a ""disaster factor."" A disaster factor is when you vote for the candidates electors that then go and vote for the President of the opposite that you wanted. Yes is happening ""rarely"" but it still has happened. It says in source 2 ""back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" They were going to do this so that the popular vote would not be counted for Kennedy. People have to keep in mind that if we vote for whom we want as the President we are voting for electors that at any point in the election can change their mind and not vote for whom you originally voted for. If electors do, do this then we have no control over it. It's like we've been told that our opinion doesn't matter or count in our country that is supposed to be free, we also have rights that prove our voice is allowed to be heard.

On the other hand like stated in source 3 people may argue that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" but then it goes further on to say ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" That statement proves that it is unfair and not right not just to the candidate but to the people who overall voted for them. It also says in source 3 that ""no region (Both Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" But it sure does play a big role in deciding whether the President you want to win, will win or not. Also, because of states being more popular than other states the Electoral College might as well say that those states are better than others, which is not true.

Overall, the Electoral College voting method should be changed to popular vote. It will make people feel like their vote actually matters and by having a popular vote the voting throughout the whole country would be more accurate than the Electoral College way. With the amount of electoral votes given to each state it isn't fair to say that each state is even. Also, with the chance of a disaster factor happening, people would feel more comfortable knowing once their vote is in it will stay that way and not be changed by something that they can't control, especially by someone else. Our voting method must change and change quick.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator,

I am writing you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this change is necessary to ensure that all Americans have a voice in our democracy.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer reflects the values of our nation. It was created in a time when the United States was a much smaller country, and when travel and communication were much more difficult. In those days, it made sense to have a system in which the people of each state would elect electors, who would then meet in their state capitals and cast their votes for President. However, in today's world, it is much more efficient and effective for the people of each state to vote directly for President.

The Electoral College is also unfair. It gives more power to some states than others, simply because those states have a larger number of electoral votes. This means that the votes of people in smaller states are worth more than the votes of people in larger states. This is not fair, and it is not democratic.

In addition, the Electoral College can lead to the election of a President who did not receive the most votes. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. This is a serious problem, because it means that the President is not truly representing the will of the people.

For all of these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. I urge you to support a bill that would elect the President by popular vote. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that all Americans have a voice in our democracy.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that having a positive attitude is a crucial factor in achieving success. A positive attitude can help us overcome challenges and setbacks, and it can also help us stay motivated and focused on our goals.

One of the main reasons why having a positive attitude is important is that it can help us overcome challenges and setbacks. When we face obstacles, it's easy to become discouraged and give up. But if we have a positive attitude, we can approach these challenges with a sense of optimism and determination. For example, if we're struggling to pass a class, we might become frustrated and feel like giving up. But if we have a positive attitude, we can remind ourselves that we're capable of success and that we can overcome this challenge.

Another reason why having a positive attitude is important is that it can help us stay motivated and focused on our goals. When we have a positive attitude, we're more likely to believe in ourselves and our abilities. This can help us stay motivated and focused on our goals, even when things get tough. For example, if we're trying to save up for a new car, we might become discouraged if we don't make as much money as we hoped. But if we have a positive attitude, we can remind ourselves that we're making progress and that we're one step closer to our goal.

Finally, having a positive attitude can help us build better relationships with others. When we have a positive attitude, we're more likely to be friendly and approachable. This can help us build better relationships with our friends, family, and coworkers. For example, if we're in a group project at school, we might become frustrated with our teammates if they're not contributing as much as they should be. But if we have a positive attitude, we can approach the situation with kindness and understanding, and we might be able to work together more effectively.

In conclusion, I believe that having a positive attitude is a crucial factor in achieving success.

"The use of animals in scientific research has been a topic of ethical debate that needs careful consideration. While some argue that animals should not be used in research due to ethical concerns, others believe that animal use is necessary for the advancement of medicine and science.

I am against the use of animals in scientific research. Firstly, it is ethically wrong to use animals in research as they are sentient beings that can feel pain and suffer. These animals are often used as subjects for experiments that are invasive, painful, and can even cause death. In addition, animals are unable to provide informed consent, so using them for research purposes is a form of exploitation.

Secondly, there are numerous alternatives to animal testing that can be used, such as in vitro tests, computer modeling, and clinical trials with volunteer human participants. These alternatives are often more effective and provide a more accurate picture of human reactions and responses, while also avoiding harm to animals.

Lastly, using animals in research can often be a waste of time and money. Studies have shown that animal testing is not always effective in predicting human response to drugs or treatments. Furthermore, animals have different biological and physiological responses, which means that research findings may not be applicable to humans.

In conclusion, the use of animals in scientific research is not only immoral but also ineffective. It is crucial that researchers focus on alternative methods that can provide accurate information without causing animal suffering. As a society, we should prioritize the ethical treatment of animals and the development of non-invasive research practices.",1,824
"I believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is sort of valuable. It can either help someone or not. But it doesn't hurt to try.

To begin with,

I say sort of because, for one, you never know what a person is going through. If the computer can tell someone's emotion why not see how they're feeling. If they're sad or depressed maybe you can help them in someway. But also, people might not want you to know how they're feeling. So using the computer's app, that is kind of disrespecting them in a way because they don't want you to know their emotions.

Also, I still think it is valuable because like a said if they're sad you can help them. Even if they don't want you to know, you can still help them secretly though. They will receive help without even knowing that they're getting help. Little do people know, aloof people who are sad tend to smile the most and just look happy. So, honestly I do feel like it is very valuable, people should use it. But not just anyone, maybe like doctors or specialist.

I think specialists should be the ones to use them because they can be the ones to help people, and they actually know how to do so. In the passage it talks about how in some people it is easy to tell by their face expression what they are feeling. But sometimes it is hard, and I agree. That is why I do think it is very valuable to use the computer.

Lastly, I do think its useable. It helps by letting us know who is depressed or stuff like that. But like I had said, I believe it should only be doctors using it and not just anyone because people and kids are immature, and we would not want others to make them feel worse. ",0,825
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think all students should participate in community service.

We have students here at SCHOOL_NAME, who need, and I'm sure would like, some tutoring. We have plenty of well-educated students here, that I'm sure would have no problem with helping the ones who need it.

A suggestion I have is to maybe put some fliers around the school, for kids who might be interested with different places around the area who might need some help around their work space.

Volunteering looks great on a college application too! I don't think some students realize that colleges look for this kind of stuff. Maybe some fliers about that, might do some good to.

Picking up garbage is a great way to volunteer, and to support our Eco

System. The Green Club should definitely know more about that. Local animal clinics, I'm sure the need help taking the dogs out to go to the restroom, cleaning cages, or restocking the animals food and water supply. The local hospital, or maybe even a nursing home. All of these are great ways to get involved in our community.

Please take these offers in to consideration.

"We as Americans have the right to vote for whom we want to be president.  American citizens should be able to vote directly for the president, not for a state of electors.  This is why we need to abolish the Electoral College.  It is unreasonable, unfair, and unreliable to the people.  In recent times, the Electoral College has been known to have made mistakes on purpose and on accident.  The Electoral College system that they have going now is very unorganized and needs to be changed.  It is about time that we change the way our citizens vote for our president.  This is a huge deal to our country considering the fact that the president is one of the most important people in the country.  We as American citizens should be able to trust that our vote was for the mandate they chose.

First, let's discuss the past issue that have happened withe Electoral College system.  The incident in 1960 with John F. Kennedy was a huge disaster.  As said in source 2 ""... The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.""  This is a perfect example of how the Electoral College is a misused way of voting.  They tried to basically sabotage Kennedy's election.  What about other problems that also occur with this system?  The voters can't always control who their electors vote for.  The confusion is a big key factor in the situations also.  Voters can easily get confuse about the electors, and they will accidentally vote for the wrong candidate.

The peoples right.  Don't they have a right of who becomes president?  They should.  The Electoral College is taking away from the excitement of getting to make a huge decision on who will run the country.  When a teenager finally becomes eighteen, what do you think is on their mind?  Freedom.  And part of getting their freedom is getting to vote for their country.  The people should have the right to vote for whomever they may choose and trust that it went for the person they chose and not to a state of electors to vote for them.  It's in the facts that more people prefer to have a direct election.  The people think that it is unfair to their rights, and we all believe that it is not the best way to decide who runs our country.

Organization is a key factor in this country.  So why aren't we showing it?  The voting system that we use to this day is very unorganized and has many flaws.  The Electoral College is much too confusing of a system that we need to be using.  We need to change our system now while we can before we hit another mistake.  We need to take advantage of the freedom that we have in this country of ours and make a difference.  We can change this system, so it is much easier and more reliable to vote from. The people want it, so it's about time that the government stands up and agrees with us on that point.  We can change our disorganization.

Our country needs to change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States.  I have discussed the problems our country has faced with Electoral College system, and hopefully it changes your view on what really is the right and better thing to do for our country.  Voting is a very big deal here in America, and it is one of the ways it shows we have freedom.  The voting system would be much more organized if the system were changed to direct vote by the people.  That is the right way.  It's about time we change the system for the better.

" Do you believe that imagination is more important than knowledge? I strongly agree with this statement, as it has greatly impacted my personal growth and learning experiences.

Firstly, I find that imagination is a valuable tool when it comes to reading books. When I read a book, I often imagine the characters and their actions, which makes the story more engaging and memorable. Additionally, imagination can help me better understand complex concepts and ideas by visualizing them in my mind.

Furthermore, imagination has been a crucial aspect of my studies. As a visual learner, I find that I learn best when I can see and understand the material in my mind's eye. This has been particularly helpful in subjects such as math and science, where abstract concepts can be difficult to grasp.

Moreover, imagination has played a significant role in my personal growth and development. By imagining different scenarios and outcomes, I have been able to better understand my own thoughts and feelings, and make more informed decisions in my life.

In conclusion, I believe that imagination is a powerful tool that has greatly impacted my personal growth and learning experiences. It has helped me to better understand complex concepts, improve my memory retention, and make more informed decisions. Therefore, I strongly agree that imagination is more important than knowledge.",1,828
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, I think that the school cell phone policy should get changed to the second policy that states ""do not allow students to have cell phones at school at all"". I think this because the students could still use their phones even if the rules say to have them turned off. I don't think just having your phone turned off will stop you from using it later on during class. When students are not aloud to have them at school for whatever reason, it can prevent the students from getting distracted during class because of texting during class or study hall while you can be doing extra credit work. There is also downfall's that include the students needing to call for a ride if their parent didn't come to pick them up or not knowing if their parent is working overtime and needs to pick up someone else. No matter what I would still pick the second policy because there are more pros than cons.

"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student!  I'm super excited to write this essay about technology and its effects on humans. I mean, who doesn't love technology, right? It's like, totally changed the way we live our lives and stuff. 

Okay, so let's start with the positive effects of technology. Like, it's made communication way easier. We can just send a text or an email instead of having to call or write a letter. It's so much faster and more convenient. And with video calls, we can see each other even if we're not in the same room. That's pretty cool, right? 

But, on the other hand, technology can also be awful for our social skills. Like, when we're always on our phones or computers, we're not really interacting with people face-to-face. And that can lead to, like, social isolation and stuff.  I don't want to be one of those people who only talks to their phone. 

And then there's the whole privacy thing. Like, technology can be really helpful for keeping track of our stuff, but it can also be used to, like, spy on us or something.  That's not cool. We need to be careful about whom we trust with our personal information. 

But, you know what? Technology can also be really helpful for learning. Like, there are so many cool educational websites and apps that can help us learn new things. And we can even use technology to connect with other people who are interested in the same things as us.  That's pretty cool, right? 

So, in conclusion, technology has both positive and negative effects on humans. We need to be careful about how we use it and make sure we're not losing our social skills or our privacy. But, at the same time, technology can also be really helpful for learning and connecting with other people.  It's all about finding that balance, you know? 

That's it!  I hope you",1,830
"The Mona Lisa is said to have many emotions. Eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. Due to a new computer software, from Professor Thomas Hung of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the University of Illinois and Professor NICU See of the University of Amsterdam, we can calculate the emotions of people and how much of certain emotions they are feeling at the time. I believe this software can be very helpful to people in many fields: in an office, at a restaurant, and especially in classrooms.

This new technology can be a very helpful tool in teaching all different types of students at their pace instead of teaching a specific group of kids at one pace. In a classroom, it can be very intimidating and nerve rocking to raise your hand and be the only one with a question. With the new software, the computer will detect if the child needs help or not by the facial expressions he, or she, makes and explain the lesson in a way that child would understand. Also, it can help teachers with the way they teach and the way they give out work. Since the computer can detect emotions, it can also detect they way the children are responding to the way the teacher is teaching and the homework he, or she, is giving them.

In conclusion, I think the new software will be very helpful, especially in schools. It could be both beneficial to students and teachers and help strengthen the education systems. Most kids do not like to learn because it is too hard and because they can not comprehend it, but if learning could be made more understandable, or easier, lack of a better term, then a greater amount of students would be more open to learning and actually trying in school.",0,831
"The advantages of limited car usage in couple different places right now. They are all participated in the no car day or no cars at all. These passages all tell about the different ways of car usage, and how different places use cars or don't use cars. This is a big deal in certain places.

There are many car-free cities Elisabeth Rosenthal states in the passage ""German Suburb, life goes on without cars."" in this passage she states that the residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers going where little soccer mom or commuting executives have ever gone before they all have given up their cars. There street parking, the driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss boarders. Car ownership is allowed, but there re only two large garages at the edge of TH development. This is now a result only 70 present of Vauban families do not own cars, and 57 present sold there car to move here.

In the United States, The Environmental protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and people are starting to act. In previous bills, 80 present of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 present to other transports.

Robert Duffer states in his passage, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" this smog is pollution its becoming a problem. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31. The same would apply to the odd-numbered plates the following day. Did everyone go with the rule no, Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters, 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London.

Everyone had to participate in this no car policy. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug in cars such as"" hybrids""and cars carrying 3 or more passengers. The public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday according to the BBC. All the smog cleared Monday Food the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

The car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá Andrew silky stated, in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked biked skated or took buses to work during a car-free day. This was the third year straight cars have been banned with only busses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million people that a lot right.? Ye sthe goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Everyone who wanted to break this rule faced a $25 fine. It was a good opportunity to take away the press and lower air pollution. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, more sidewalks, nice smooth ones, new restaurants, upscale shopping. Alot of new stuff after stooping all car population. You may have lost an everyday resource everybody is used to, but it all got replaced by something way better you even got new things built that's a lot better than a dirty city.

""The End of Car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal state sing her passage that president Obama's goals to curb the united stated greenhouse gas emissions unveiled. This proves that all there cities all are trying to make where they live a better place and not polluted, and it can help out the surroundings around you and make it a newer and nicer place, I agree with all there statements on the end of car culture.

"Title: The Power of Growth: My Experiences and Emerson's Insights

Introduction:
Hey there, it's me, [Your Name], an average 8th grader, and today I'm going to talk about growth and how it's super important in our lives. I'm going to share my own experiences learning to play the guitar, and then I'll tell you about this cool guy named Ralph Waldo Emerson who said some really deep stuff about growth too. So, let's get started!

My Experiences:
So, I've been playing the guitar for like, a year now, and it's been a wild ride. At first, it was really hard, like, my fingers would hurt so much, and I couldn't even play a full song. But then I set a goal for myself to learn more songs and practice every day, and it started to get easier. Now I can play like, a bunch of songs and even write my own music! It's so cool to see how far I've come and how much I've grown as a musician.

Emerson's Insights:
Ralph Waldo Emerson was this really smart guy who lived a long time ago, and he said some stuff about growth that I think is super true. He said, ""Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment."" That means don't be afraid to try new things and take risks, because that's how we grow and learn. He also said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That's so important because it means that we should be proud of who we are and not try to change ourselves to fit in with what others want us to be.

Why It's Hard to Keep Growing:
But, it's not always easy to keep growing and pushing ourselves beyond what we have already mastered. Sometimes it can be hard to stay motivated and keep practicing, especially when things get tough. Like, when I was first starting out with the guitar, I would get frustrated when I couldn't play something right away, but now I know that it's okay to make mistakes and that they'",1,833
"Whoever thought that a machine could read a person's emotions? To our surprise, a highly advanced technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is capable of reading one's emotion by calculating the movement of our face muscles. Some may say that this technology has no value and should be abandoned. However, it is clear that this technology has a great amount of value because it helps us better understand the muscles in our face, it improves communication between people, and can improve the quality of faces in computers.

First, the experts of the software are constantly experimenting on different parts of the muscles in our face. By doing so, the experts are better understanding the part's of the muscles. On paragraph 3, the author Clara states that, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This shows that the experts have noticed these odd movements of the muscles. The muscles function similarly to legs. Also, on paragraph 4, the author talks about how this new technology can even detect ones mixed emotions. The evidence that he uses is the painting of Mona Lisa. The painting was filled with different types of emotions such as 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Next, the technology has played a major role in improving our communication between people. On paragraph 6, the author shows us that most communications between people is through nonverbal. The technology can help ones understanding of emotional communications, thus improving their nonverbal communication. The technology can tell when someone is zoned out or just completely bored. On paragraph 6, the author states that ""A classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This machine could better the communication between teachers and students.

Not only does this machine improve communications, this machine can improve facial expressions in our games and our technology. At the middle of paragraph 6, the author states that ""The same technology can make computer-anmated faces more expressive"". This will improve the quality of our video-games. Video games will become more vivid and realistic. Also, in the medical field, this improves the video surgery. With a better video surgery, more lives will be saved.

Lastly, the facial technology will and has played a major role in our lives. This machinery is a huge technological discovery and should be continued. This is because the technology has helped us better understand our facial muscles, has improved nonverbal communications between people, and has improved the quality of our computer-animated faces. This technology can play roles in almost every thing we do. From video games to hospitals, this machine does it all.",0,834
"Okay, here is my essay on whether true self-esteem comes from praise or achievement:

Self-esteem is a crucial aspect of a person's overall well-being, and it can be challenging to determine whether it comes from praise or achievement. On one hand, praise can make a person feel good about themselves and their abilities, while on the other hand, achievement can provide a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against each and suggest a conclusion on which one is more effective in fostering true self-esteem.

On the one hand, praise can be a powerful tool for building self-esteem. When someone receives praise for their efforts or accomplishments, it can make them feel appreciated and valued. This can boost their confidence and self-worth, and make them feel more motivated to continue working hard. For example, a teacher might praise a student for their good grades, which can make the student feel proud of themselves and more likely to strive for excellence in the future.

However, there are also arguments against praising someone for deficient work. If someone is constantly praised for work that is not up to par, they may begin to feel like they don't have to put in much effort to succeed. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a false sense of self-esteem. For instance, a parent might constantly praise their child for their artwork, even if it is not very good, which can make the child feel like they don't need to improve.

On the other hand, achievement can also be a source of true self-esteem. When someone works hard and achieves a goal, it can give them a sense of accomplishment and self-worth that is based on their own efforts. This can be more effective than praise because it provides a tangible basis for self-esteem. For example, a student might work hard to study for a test and pass with a high grade, which can give them a sense of accomplishment and self-esteem that is not based on praise.

In conclusion, both praise and achievement can be sources of true self-esteem, but achievement is more effective. While praise can make someone feel good about",1,835
"The ""Face of Mars"" was not created by aliens. The ""face"" is a mesa, an elevated piece of land similar to a plateau. The mesa is about 2 miles long, and the face is created by the shadows from protruding rock. The features of this landform could have been created by aliens if they had the ability to carve a two-mile-long mesa to look like a face, not knowing what it looked like while they were carving it. Since they were on the ground they we carving, they would have had to either cut into the rock blindly, or have a method to see what the face looked like. That method, be it mechanical or optical should still be visible. The aliens might not be humanoid, and might not know what a human face looked like. They wouldn't be able to cut out an image of something if they don't know what it looks like. Even if aliens could cut a face into the rock, there would be fragments of that rock lying all around the base of the landform. Most of the debris might be swept away over time, but there would still be some. If the carving was done by aliens, they would have to have some way to get on top of the mesa, and that might be visible. It could be stairs, or a ladder, or a rope, but it should be visible to the satellite pictures. If the aliens did cut the face into the mesa, then if they would have gone about it differently. Assuming that the aliens created the face is assuming that they are intelligent beings. Intelligent beings would most likely have created finer details or carved a symbol or word to show who created the face. If they are unintelligent beings, how did they get on top of the mesa and how did they cut out the face.",0,836
"As a language model AI, it is not my place to hold an opinion or take a stance on any political issue. However, I can provide a balanced view on the topic, drawing from both sides of the argument.

On one hand, politicians have the responsibility to keep some information confidential from the public for the greater good of society. For instance, if a country is at war, revealing sensitive military strategies to the public can put the lives of soldiers and the country’s security at risk. In this case, it is necessary for the leaders to withhold information.

Similarly, in a democratic country, withholding sensitive information from the public can prevent panic and chaos. For example, if the government receives credible intelligence about a terrorist attack, revealing this information to the public can cause unnecessary fear and chaos. The government may choose to withhold such information to avoid panic and take appropriate measures to prevent the attack.

Furthermore, politicians may also withhold confidential information for strategic reasons. For example, in a negotiation with another country or organization, withholding certain information may help the government achieve a favorable outcome. In such cases, keeping the information confidential may be necessary to protect the country’s interests and obtain the best possible deal.

On the other hand, withholding information can lead to distrust and suspicion among the public. In a democratic society, the government derives its power from the people, and the people have the right to access information that affects their lives. If politicians withhold information from the public, it can erode trust in the government and make people question the motives of the politicians.

Moreover, withholding information can lead to cover-ups and corruption. If politicians have the power to keep information confidential, they can use this power to hide their mistakes and wrongdoing. This can lead to a culture of secrecy and undermine the democratic values of transparency and accountability.

In conclusion, while there may be situations where it is necessary for politicians to withhold information from the public, this should not be the norm. In a democratic society, transparency and accountability are crucial to maintaining trust between the government and the people. Therefore, politicians should only withhold information when it is necessary for the greater good of society, and they should do so in a way that is transparent and accountable.

"I think we should change elections to popular vote because it will give the people more say in the elections, it will be more fair, and you would actually be voting for the president and vice president themselves, and not for a slate of electors.

First, if we change elections to be based off of popular vote people will have more say in the elections as to who gets elected. For example, when you cast a vote for the president you want to be elected you aren't voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors who will vote for the president. But if we change it to popular vote you will actually be voting for the president and vice president themselves instead of voting for a slate.

"First impressions are the initial opinions or judgments that we form about someone or something. They are often based on our first encounter with a person or situation, and they can greatly influence our behavior and attitudes towards them. While first impressions can be difficult to change, they can also be modified or corrected with time and experience.

One of the main reasons why first impressions can be difficult to change is because they are often based on superficial factors, such as appearance or behavior. For example, if we meet someone who is dressed in a way that we find unappealing or who behaves in a way that we find off-putting, we may form a negative first impression of them without even knowing them well. These initial judgments can be hard to shake off, even if we later learn that the person is actually very kind or intelligent.

However, first impressions can also be changed through conscious effort and exposure to different experiences. For instance, if we meet someone who we initially found uninteresting or boring, but later learn that they have a lot of hidden talents or interests, we may begin to see them in a new light. Similarly, if we have a negative first impression of a place or situation, but later visit it again and have a positive experience, we may start to see it differently.

First impressions can also have a significant impact on our behavior and attitudes towards someone. For example, if we have a negative first impression of someone, we may be more likely to avoid them or treat them poorly. On the other hand, if we have a positive first impression of someone, we may be more likely to seek them out for conversation or friendship. Additionally, first impressions can affect our overall behavior and attitudes towards a group or situation. For instance, if we have a negative first impression of a certain type of people or a certain place, we may be more likely to avoid or dislike them in the future.

In conclusion, first impressions can be difficult to change, but they can also be modified or corrected with time and experience. They can greatly influence our behavior and attitudes towards someone or something, and it is important to be aware of the potential impact of our first impressions on our interactions with others. Whether it is a person, a place, or a situation, it is always worth taking the time to get to know the full story before forming a final judgment.",1,839
"Making a good first impression is important as it can shape how we are seen and treated by those around us. Having a positive first impression can go a long way in establishing trust and rapport with others, while having a negative first impression can lead to suspicion and unease. For example, when I first started working at my new job, I made sure to smile and shake my manager's hand firmly to give a friendly impression. We ended up working together for many years and built a solid relationship of trust and understanding.

Having patience when meeting someone for the first time is also key. I once had a negative first impression of a colleague due to a misunderstanding, but as I got to know them better and became more patient, I found that I actually liked and respected them. This teaches us the importance of understanding and taking the time to develop relationships with others in order to see past first impressions.",1,840
"When looking for important advice you usually have a ""go to person"" and then multiple people around you that you ask what to do in the problem you are having. Talking with more than yourself, one other person, or five other people is an amazing thing to do because if you only talk to one person about your troubles than they may get annoyed with you or could be a fake friend. When you have more conversation with people are what you are thought you can see both perspectives, you have more knowledge to what you are talking about, and lastly, improving your life skills. If you have something on your mind always look to talking with family and friends about it, even if you have different point of views.

You may not think about it all the time, but you are very bias to what you like including, food, drinks, pets, names, school, you name it. You can do it whenever, it is like asking someone if they like dogs or cats better, most people are quick to jump to the answer and that is bias towards the animal that they like better. When you talk to other people even that are not like you, you can see why other people like dogs or cats and their pro's to it. It's just like taking a poll in the classroom or bar graphing who is wearing a different type of shoe, but you are taking the knowledge and exporting it into your decision. So, next time talk to other people so your not bias, and you get to see the positive and negative of your decision.

Have you ever heard of the quote ""The more you know the better you are off,"" Unknown? That quote is one-hundred percent true because you gain so much more brainpower when talking to others. Most adults when they are having a hard time deciding something they ask other adults, and that usually brings down the negative part. What they don't understand is when you ask a kid they can turn your idea into something brilliant that you may of never thought of. Taking to kids is even more smart idea to do when it is something fun because then you can bring their fun into your idea and make it more exciting. Next time don't just talk to people your age, talk to everyone around you.

There are so many skills you need for life out there you can't count them all. It just happens that communicating with people is a huge life skill. More outgoing people don't even blink at the option to go and talk to someone when shyer people need a little help, and seeking other peoples opinions during school or outside it is a great way to get people out of their shell. Talking to someone is more than a life skill it is an everyday skill and that is why it is so greatly important. The best way to improve at it is to do it.

The next time you want to advise talk to more than yourself, one other person, or even five people. While you don't need to go and talk to everyone off of the street or who you walk by you don't only want your thoughts in your head. When seeking other peoples opinions you can see both points of view, have more knowledge and common knowledge, and finally have better life skills. Try it out and see how better your own opinions come, I'm sure they will come from weak one to stronger ones it a matter of days.",0,841

In this essay, I will research what schools are doing to integrate cell phones for educational purposes, analyze the potential negative effects, look into examples of students relying too much on technology, discuss possible ways to keep students focused, and research how implementing cell phones for educational purposes affects the students' overall learning.

Firstly, many schools are using cell phones to enhance the learning experience by providing students with access to educational apps, online resources, and communication tools. For example, some schools use messaging apps to communicate with students and their parents, while others use apps to provide students with virtual textbooks and educational games. However, there are also potential negative effects to consider. For instance, excessive screen time can lead to a decrease in attention span and an increase in distractions, which can negatively impact the learning process.

Furthermore, there are examples of students relying too much on technology to complete academic tasks. For instance, a student may rely on their phone to take notes instead of actively listening and engaging in class discussions. This can lead to a lack of understanding of the material and a decrease in critical thinking skills. Additionally, over-reliance on technology can lead to a lack of creativity and problem-solving skills, as students may rely on their phones to solve problems instead of thinking critically.

To keep students focused while using cell phones for learning, schools can implement rules and guidelines for their use. For instance, students can be required to keep their phones in a designated area, such as a phone bin, during class time. This can help to minimize distractions and ensure that students are fully engaged in the learning process. Additionally, teachers can provide students with interactive activities and games that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills, rather than relying solely on technology.

Finally, research has shown that implementing cell phones for educational purposes can have a positive impact on students' overall learning. For instance, a study by the University of Maryland found that students who used their phones to access educational apps",1,842
"On the one hand, it is essential for students to understand ideas and concepts because they provide a framework for learning. When students understand the underlying principles behind a topic, they can apply that knowledge to different situations. For example, if a student understands the concept of gravity, they can use that knowledge to explain why objects fall to the ground or why planets orbit the sun. Understanding the ideas behind a topic allows students to think critically and problem-solve, which are essential skills for success in the workforce.

Moreover, focusing on ideas and concepts can help students develop a love of learning. When students are taught to memorize facts without understanding the underlying principles, they may become bored or disinterested in the subject. However, when students are encouraged to explore ideas and concepts, they are more likely to become engaged and curious about the topic. This can lead to a lifelong love of learning and a desire to continue exploring new ideas and concepts.

On the other hand, it is also important for students to learn facts because they provide a foundation of knowledge. Facts are essential building blocks for understanding ideas and concepts. For example, a student cannot understand the concept of photosynthesis without first learning the facts about the process. Similarly, a student cannot understand the concept of the American Revolution without first learning the facts about the events leading up to it.

Additionally, learning facts can help students develop critical thinking skills. When students are taught to memorize facts, they are also learning how to analyze and evaluate information. They must determine which facts are relevant and which are not, and they must learn how to use those facts to draw conclusions and make decisions. These skills are essential for success in the workforce, where employees must be able to analyze data and make informed decisions.

In conclusion, both understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are essential for a well-rounded education. While understanding ideas and concepts provides a framework for learning and encourages critical thinking, learning facts provides a foundation of knowledge and helps develop critical thinking skills. Therefore, educators should strive to strike a balance between teaching both aspects in their lessons to ensure that students receive a comprehensive education.

"I believe that having facial recognition technology in a classroom would be beneficial to everyone involved. It would allow for the students to be put back on track if they are distracted or bored. It would also aide the teachers by giving them feedback that they might've never received before. Lastly, as a domino effect, it would help the entire world because we would be making the education system for our future a lot better.

Firstly, if we had facial recognition technology in the classrooms, it would allow for our students to receive a better education. For example, a student is in class one day and a teacher is giving a lecture that they are just not interested in or don't quite understand so that student's mind begins to wander because they are bored. With the facial recognition, that student would be detected as distracted, bored, or even confused, so the teacher can make adjustments to the learning space and/or the way that the material is being taught. This technology would help the students who would normally be confused and too shy to say anything, receive help and better understand what they are having issues with.

Secondly, this facial recognition technology would be very helpful to teachers who would work with it. They would be getting direct feedback from the class without them even having to say anything. If the class is confused, the teacher can work around the confusion and readjust. This would ensure that students achieve the most information possible and would, therefore, make our teachers and the education system a lot better.

Lastly, I believe that the entire world could benefit from this technological advancement. Our world is changing and advancing technologically very quickly, and we have to be able to keep up. As the world gets smarter, we must get smarter with it. Better technology in the classroom means better learning which means even better, smarter pupils. Any technological advancement that makes our future doctors, surgeons, lawyers, etc. smarter then, I believe, must be put into use right away. We would be securing our future as a nation.

To conclude, the implementing of better technology in any form would be very good. Everyone would benefit from this technology in the education system. That is why I believe that it would be very valuable to implement the technology talked about in this essay in the classroom.  ",0,844
"Dear Senator, I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.

Just like Source 2, I feel ""The electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "" ""Abolish the electoral college!"". When you vote, you vote for ""a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President"" Source 2, Paragraph 2. Why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" Source 2, Paragraph 2. In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ad they focus on the ""bigger"" and more important swing states to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had.

In Source 1, it says how ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" You're electing electors instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can't even control who your electors vote for! So people can vote for an elector thinking that he's going to vote for the Republican Party, but then he votes for the Democratic Party. This process can be very misleading. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."". The disaster factor as mentioned in Source 2 could always occur.

Some counterarguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them. The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Runoff elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if it's not majority.

So, hopefully you see my view on this issue and the Electoral College can be eliminated.",0,845
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to share my perspective on the debate around the Electoral College system. There are reasonable arguments on both sides of this issue, and as citizens, we should thoughtfully consider different viewpoints. 

Those who support keeping the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on populous regions. It can also help smaller states still feel represented in presidential elections. However, others note that the system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has happened a few times throughout history.

Some data shows that electoral votes are not always proportionate to state populations either. For example, while California has over 39 million people, it has 55 electoral votes compared to Wyoming's 3 electoral votes for its population of under 600,000 people. This can be seen as giving some citizens more influence than others based on their state of residence. 

Supporters of a popular vote counter that it would make every vote truly equal and ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide wins. They believe this aligns better with democratic principles. However, opponents note that candidates may still focus campaigns only in population centers under this system. 

After carefully considering both sides, I believe changing to a national popular vote could strengthen our democracy and help address some imbalances in the current system. While it may not be a perfect solution, it seems more fair and aligned with the ideals of one person, one vote. Citizens across state lines would have an equal say in choosing their president. This may help increase voter turnout as more people feel their vote directly impacts the outcome.

As our elected representative, I ask that you thoughtfully consider these perspectives as this important issue is debated. Protecting democratic principles and equal representation for all citizens should be top priorities. Reasonable people can disagree on this complex issue, so open dialogue is important.

Thank you for your public service and for representing the views of all [state name] residents on this matter. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,846
"People think about today's world as the era of technology; constantly advancing and creating new ideas beneficial to us all. But are they really benefiting all of us? That's where the car comes in. Automobiles are one of the highest polluting machines out there. People are constantly worrying about greenhouse gas emissions while they use their cars consistently. Now, when us stubborn Americans try to imagine a life without cars, we immediately oppose the idea. But can you blame us? Society has been built upon the idea of cars since World War II. Cities are so widely spread out that the mere thought of walking or biking to the nearest shopping mall makes you appreciate your car even more. It could take a matter of time before any civilization modernizes into a car-free society.

But people must realize what the real matter here is; less driving equals a healthier planet. Think all of how much less pollution would be around if people did not use their cars so religiously. Our earth is sacred. If we continue to destroy it with fossil fuels and car exhaust, there will not be anything left for generations to come.

Not only would the environment improve drastically, but people would also save money from not having to buy gas! If you pay $3.50 for a gallon of gas, that can add up extremely quick. Imagine all the alternatives you could use that money for instead of gas. Why pay for oil when you can simply ride a bike for free? Biking and walking rather than driving is much healthier for your physical state as well. Altogether, people will be much happier and at a better state of mind with cars banished from every day life.

As you see in cities such as Seattle, Washington for example; hardly anyone owns a car. The people have revolutionized into using the trains. The subways create less smog, more efficient carpooling, and will still get you to your destination in a blink of an eye. Seattle is a booming city, teaming with life. If that is not proof of sufficient life without cars, then I do not know what is.

Humans' lives revolve around automobiles. Just think about your average day. I can guarantee you spend a good amount of time driving hastily around town trying to get to your many destinations. This can be stressful. As stated in one of the articles above, a media trainer and mother of two who resides in Vauban, Germany, a car-free city, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Nobody wants to spend their evenings in their car while they could be spending quality time with their family, but that seems to be the way everyone lives nowadays.

A car-free world is the ideal society us as people should strive for. There are exponential benefits to life without automobiles and many downfalls to life with automobiles. If people can all stand together on the idea of a better way of life, then why not try it?",0,847
"In life, it is important to set your own character in order to find success. Success is not something that is handed to you, but something that you have to work hard for. By setting your own character, you are creating a path toward achieving your goals. Your character is the foundation for how you will approach life, its challenges, and even success. 

Your character is the set of values that you live by, decisions you make, and your attitude towards life. It is important to have a strong moral compass and not be swayed by peer pressure or popular trends. The power of your character lies in the strength of your convictions and the balance that it brings to your life. When you live with strong values, you are able to make the right decisions in life, no matter how difficult or unpopular they may be. 

Having a strong character is also essential to having a successful career and achieving your goals. If you have clear goals and a strong will to work hard, you can achieve a lot. You have to stay focused and motivated to be successful; setting your own character helps you do just that by emphasizing qualities such as grit, determination, and resilience. 

Setting your own character is critical to find success. It serves as a guiding light to make the right decisions and to stay focused on the goal at hand. Having a strong character is the foundation for success, so make sure to take the time to set yours.",1,848
"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life, Because if you have a negative attitude that means you don't believe in your self, or you are insecure, so you may not be successful in life; but if you have a positive attitude, and know what you're doing is correct, so what you're doing will make you successful in life. Being positive will make you successful. If you are successful in life that means you are positive, and you are happy that you are doing everything as you want.

Being successful means that you have achieve most of the things you want in life like buying a house, a nice car, going to college, or getting a diploma; so you always should stay positive, and try hard for something you want in life. Being negative won't help you get what you want, or achieve a goal or a dream because you won't believe in your self, and you will just let everything just go, and not really try hard for what you want. You make your life successful by doing what you want, and trying hard for and not giving up and being negative to be successful you will make mistakes, but you learn of those mistakes, and not make them again, or do better at something you didn't do good on the first time, so just keep trying, and stay positive, and be successful in life",0,849
" Dear Senator,

As you consider the system for electing the President of the United States, I urge you to keep or modify it to a popular vote. Many people believe that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, and there are excellent reasons to support this position.

One of the most compelling arguments against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. The winner of the popular vote may not always win the presidency due to the winner-take-all system used in many states. This may lead to candidates focusing on swing states instead of paying attention to the needs of all voters. Bradford Plummer of Mother Jones argues that ""the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" and that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational (para 6).

Another argument against the Electoral College is that it can lead to a disaster. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. As Plummer points out, state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could defy the will of the people (para 3).

On the other hand, there are practical reasons to retain the Electoral College. Firstly, the certainty of an outcome is less likely to be disputed than a popular vote. Poster argues that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote (para 1). Secondly, the system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, which is essential for a successful presidency. Without the Electoral College, a candidate with only regional appeal would have little incentive to campaign in other regions",1,850
"Dear Principal:

Sports and other activities are essential to a student's life. It helps them develop and have fun. Sports can also have its drawbacks. I agree with you. I think the policy should be changed so that students shouldn't be allowed to play sports unless they have at least a grade B average.

To start off, sports and other activities can take time with the child's studies, causing them to have low grades. In the future the low grades will not help them to have a successful life. The grades that students make in high school can affect their futures, whether they go to college and have a well-paying job or not. Students with a C average should not be allowed to play sports and other activities because they already have a low grade, why keep on going from distracting sports. The students need to concentrate on school and to make better grades. Thirty percent of students say their grades get lower when they're involved in a sport or activity since it distracts them.

Another supporting reason is that sports tend to separate students from more important things, such as doing their homework, studying for tests, and others. This will get them lower than a C average. Students with an average B have proved they can handle these things since their grade is satisfactory. It's also unfair for those students who make an average B who play sports because they work so hard to get those grades to be able to play sports. I have had experiences with that kind of unfairness.

To sum up my thoughts, these all comes down to education. I understand that many students have a grade C average, but I think changing the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

Thank you",0,851
"The U.S. has been using the Electoral College for a long time.  I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?  Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is.  I don't think popular vote would get us a good president, people would pick the one who makes those promises that will only be good for a short time.  The U.S. needs a president who can sure us we won't have to worry about everybody losing there jobs soon or not being able to pay for gas because its up to $4.00 a gallon.

It's a very time managed process, it's not like they take some names, write them on a piece of paper, mix them up in a hat, and grab the first one you feel.  How big of a mistake would that be? Electoral College even sounds like a well-thought-out idea, for one it has the word college in it and college is where you get a better education for your future.  When electing a President you want to know that you will have a good future with the president that is elected.  Just because the Electoral College is old doesn't mean it isn't a good process.

Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

Voting for the next President of the United States isn't something you would just want to rest in the hands of popular votes, you could end up with someone who doesn't even know what he is doing, or even decides he can't handle all the responsibility of being the President.  I feel very strong about my thoughts on the subject and believe that the Electoral College is still the way to go.",0,852
"I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. There are a number of reasons why this is the case.

One of the main reasons is that a tour guide is experienced and knowledgeable about the different areas that they are visiting. This means that they can ensure that everyone on the tour has the best possible experience. Additionally, they can ensure that everyone is following the same itinerary, which minimizes the likelihood of missed opportunities or accidents.

Another reason why traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel is that they are able to provide a unique experience. This is because they are able to mix different types of attractions and activities together so that everyone can have something interesting to look forward to. Furthermore, they are also able to provide information about the areas that they are visiting and the history behind them. This ensures that everyone on the tour has a better understanding of what they are seeing.

Finally, a tour guide is also able to provide a sense of community. This is because they are able to create a bond with their group members and make sure that everyone is having a great time. This ensures that everyone is willing to return to the tour guide for future visits.

"Character traits are essential components of our personalities and identity. Many of us believe that these traits can be changed and altered based on our decisions and choices. But is this something that is within our control? In this essay, I will discuss the idea that we can choose our character traits, and explore whether we can exercise discretion over traits such as being quiet, being social, and being over oneself. 

To begin, let's consider the role of choice in determining personality traits. It's certainly possible for us to choose to be quiet in certain social settings, or to be more social in other settings. In this way, our level of sociability can be determined by our choice at the moment. Similarly, a person can choose to focus on themselves and their own wellbeing rather than serve the needs of others. Although not every person will make the same decision, these kinds of choices are made by many individuals in different situations.

Moreover, researchers have found that even seemingly unchangeable traits, such as extroversion and introversion, can be taken on through conscious effort over time. For example, an introverted person can choose to become more extroverted by making small changes to their behavior and gradually expanding their social circle. Likewise, an extroverted person can choose to become more introverted by limiting their social engagements and doing more activities alone. In this way, our character traits are not necessarily predetermined by our genetic makeup, but can be altered through a combination of conscious effort and personal choice. 

In conclusion, it is possible to choose our character traits, and although the changes may take some time, they are definitely within our control. Whether we choose to be quiet or social, or to focus on ourselves or others, it is all determined by the choices we make. In doing so, we also have the power to shape our identities according to the character traits we choose.",1,854
"Distance learning is a recent innovation that some schools now offer by way of online or video conference. It is becoming a popular method of education because kids do not like getting up early in the morning and going to school for eight hours. The online method allows kids to log on to class at whatever time of the day to do their work. I do not think it is healthy to take these classes and stare at a computer screen all day, rather, I believe children should go to school and sit in a classroom to learn. Students do not benefit from this type of learning as much as they would if they went to a school because individuals would have less of a way to make friends and enjoy their school experience, there would be no sports that people could do, and there is not as much guidance or help that a person could reach out to if they needed it.

Online teaching does not allow kids to make friends or have the same school experience that a person should have in their life. I believe that it is essential for people to have the experience of school because it will be useful in the workforce and the real world. There will be amazing and terrible times in a school, but there will also be amazing and terrible times in someone's life. I, myself, have had horrible things happen to me during my school career but also some of the rest things that have ever happened to me have been because of school. For example, I have won various academic awards during my high school career and that will be very useful later in life when I am applying for a job.

Furthermore, there would be no chance to play sports that could very well shape a person's future. Many people around the world compete in sports for a living such as football, basketball, soccer, and many other things. The people that are on teams, such as the Miami Heat for the National Basketball Association, started out playing this sport in elementary or high school, they then went on to college, and now they are making millions of dollars playing for a famous sports team. They are making money by doing what they love, and it all started when they were in school. Taking classes through a computer screen does not give individuals the chance to do such things because there are no teams that they could join.

Lastly, there is not as much guidance for someone with this method of learning and these classes. Kids struggle with all different subjects; whether it be math, reading, writing, science, or history, there needs to be someone in front of them to help them work out the issue when there is one. Studies show that kids learn better from someone when they are getting help from a teacher in a classroom. This is because the child can interact and communicate better with the teacher being with them. Also, teachers are sometimes kids lifelines because children have sad home lives and brutal families these days. Having the one on one relationship with a student can make all the difference in the world.

There are people that would argue saying children are better off taking the online classes because it helps with mental health. I believe that mental health would still be negatively affected if a person went the route of taking online classes because no matter if you are in a classroom or if you are at home, there is still social media, and it is the number one cause of teen depression, not school. If a parent wants to help a child's mental health they should make them stay away from social media. A person should not have to miss out on such a great time in their life because of anxiety. If they stay around nice people and do not get involved with bullies, there mental health will be in balance.

To conclude, I strongly believe that children should be in a classroom at a school instead of being at home on the computer taking classes every day because school brings about exciting experiences, allows children to let their athletic ability shine, and gives them guidance they need to finish high school. If I had taken all of my classes online and stayed at home, I do not think I would be as happy as I am coming to school every day and being with my friends. I have not, so exquisite days just like anyone else would, but I would not change my life for anything. It has made me turn from an introvert to an extrovert because I have had to quit being a shy little kid. School is essential to having a profound life and to making it in this world. ",0,855
"Facial Action Coding at schools?

Classrooms with, Facial Action Coding, I think for a classroom with Facial Action Coding would not be such a good idea in a classroom. There are many reasons why it's not a good idea. There are many emotions in a student in a classroom that a student wouldn't want to be recognize. For many students there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out. In paragraph 3 it tells readers that"" happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.

For many students I honestly think a lot of students would not like it. Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classrooms is it might distract many of the students. A lot of classroom students are already going through a lot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be picked up by the system for an example a student could be really sad about his grades and doesn't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.

Other places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hospitals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hospital because it can help a lot of people that are sick and feeling pain. In paragraph 3 it says the system can pick up happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. At a hospital a patient could be help out with the machine and tell if she or he is sad or happy. At a nursing home he can help out the old folks by making sure that there not depressed or angry.

What if the Facial Action Coding system shows that 50% percent of the student show that they really get the work. And the other 50% percent do not get the work what would the teacher do? Would the teacher choice be right to choose to get the same work where the 50% percent doesn't understand it and give the same work to the other 50% percent of the class that already knows how to solve the work. I think it not a good idea for classrooms to have Facial Action Coding System at schools.

At schools, it might not be a good idea and might be better in many other places. For many students it could distract them or if other don't want to show emotions because of their personal thoughts being shown to teachers. Would you want schools to have this new Facial Action Coding System at there school and on computers?  ",0,856
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the people. In recent elections, candidates have won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the Electoral College. This is undemocratic and unfair to the majority of voters.

There are several reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it gives too much power to a few states. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency with only 304 electoral votes, despite losing the popular vote by over 3 million votes. This is because Trump won a majority of votes in a few key swing states, such as Ohio and Florida.

Second, the Electoral College discourages voter participation. Voters in states that are considered to be ""safe"" for one party or the other often feel that their vote does not matter. This is because the candidate who will win the electoral votes in that state is already a foregone conclusion.

Third, the Electoral College is a relic of the past. It was created in the 18th century when the United States was a very different country. At that time, communication and travel were much slower, and it was difficult for people to vote in a national election. The Electoral College was designed as a way to ensure that all states had a voice in the election of the President.

However, in the 21st century, there is no longer any need for the Electoral College. Communication and travel are much faster, and it is easy for people to vote in a national election. There is no reason why the President of the United States should not be elected by the popular vote of all eligible voters.

I urge you to support legislation that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President of the United States by popular vote. This would be a major step forward for democracy in the United States.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,857
"Dear senator my opinion of the electoral college is that we should change it to a more popular vote. As stated in the article ""under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors"" in this electoral college why do voters vote for electors and not for whom they directly want voted in. Also, what about the disaster factor and voters actually get confused on who they are actually voting for. At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system, in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the states they know they will have the best chance for more votes. Like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. The people need a popular vote because they don't want to vote for people who will vote for them, they want to vote directly for the person they want to vote for and as everyone refers the electoral college to as an anachronism, a non-democratic way of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. Its official the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without mush basis in reality. Because some people get so confused or angry on who they are voting for they end up not voting or vote for someone completely random they become faithless as they cannot find a solution.  ",0,858
"Being honest is one of the most important qualities a person can possess. It is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and it is essential for building trust and respect. When we are honest, we show that we value the other person's opinion and that we are willing to listen to their perspective. This can help build stronger bonds and improve communication.

Being honest can also have a positive impact on our emotional well-being. When we are honest with ourselves, we can better understand our own feelings and thoughts. This can help us make better decisions and improve our overall mental health. Additionally, when we are honest with others, we can reduce the stress and anxiety that comes from hiding or lying. This can lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.

Honesty can also have a positive impact on society as a whole. When people are honest, they contribute to a more trustworthy and reliable environment. This can help to reduce crime and improve safety. Additionally, honesty can help to promote transparency and accountability in government and other institutions. This can lead to a more just and fair society.

In conclusion, being honest is an essential quality that can have a positive impact on people and society as a whole. By being honest, we can build stronger relationships, improve our emotional well-being, and contribute to a more trustworthy and just society. It is important that we prioritize honesty in all aspects of our lives.",1,859
"New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest technology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this technology is actually worth the resources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accommodate and keep their students on track. The article did state that the technology could identify when a student is ""confused or bored"" and then ""modify the lesson"" to keep a student engaged. In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student. But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not? By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to estate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas.

Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accommodate for the many ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frustration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been off putting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelike or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact, so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed.",0,860
"My position on driverless cars is, that they won't be as safe as cars driven by humans. I believe this because they wouldn't know when to stop, they might go out of control, and they wouldn't be very supportive during deflect stations.

First I believe they wouldn't know when to stop because they might be road block and they wouldn't be able to identify the objects. Examples from the passage are, the cars will probably have a hard time navigating through work zones and around accidents. The cars will also have to deal with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadworks or roadblocks that lie ahead for the autonomous car.

Second reason is, they might go out of control. The car might face some technical deities and someone will most likely get injured. If some dies get injured who will be at fault? Wil it is the driver or the manufacturer. I believe it will be the manufacturer because they made the car and they didn't make sure if it was safe for the people to drive around in or not.

My last reason is They wouldn't be as supportive during deflect stations. I think They wouldn't be very supportive because the car might not know what to do. For example, if there was roadblock and the car didn't or couldn't indemnify them and the car crushes. What if the car was told to go somewhere and went to wrong way? Will it be the cars fault. And if the car got broken down for no reason during traffic will it be okay for other people.

In conclusion i belief that driverless cars won't be as safe as cars driven by humans. I believe this because they wouldn't know when to stop, they might go out of control, and they wouldn't be very supportive during deflect stations.",0,861
" Summer is a time to unwind and enjoy the warm weather, time with loved ones, and a break from the stress of school or work. As a student, I believe that summer is a time to relax and recharge, and for adults, it is just as important to take a break from their daily routines and responsibilities.

During the school year, students are constantly bombarded with assignments, tests, and projects. It can be overwhelming and stressful, and I believe that summer is the perfect time to take a break from all of that. Not only does it give us a chance to catch up on sleep and rest, but it also allows us to spend time with our friends and family, which is essential for our mental and emotional well-being.

Additionally, summer is a time for students to pursue their goals and interests outside the classroom. Whether it's getting a part-time job, volunteering, or traveling, summer provides us with the opportunity to gain new experiences and develop new skills. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have as much support or resources as others, as it allows them to take charge of their own personal and professional development.

As an educator, I understand the importance of a break from the daily grind of teaching. Teachers work hard to prepare their students for success, and it's essential that they take the time to recharge and refresh. However, I also know that students need a break from the classroom, and a longer summer vacation could provide them with the time and space to pursue their interests and goals.

In conclusion, I believe that summer is a time to relax, recharge, and pursue personal and professional goals. Whether you're a student or an adult, taking a break from the daily routine is essential for our mental and emotional well-being. A longer summer vacation could provide students with the time and space to pursue their interests and goals, while also allowing them to take a break from the stress of school and work.",1,862
"Why the Facial Action Coding System Can Help the Young Scholars of Today

The Facial Action Coding System is a new software from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. NICU See that can recognize human emotions. This invention was tested on Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa portrait. According to the software, Ms Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. While the Facial Action Coding System may seem like a high-tech toy, it could have some really important affects to help our schools. Having Prof. Huang's emotion detectors in classrooms would benefit the learning and success rates of students around the world.

The Facial Action Coding System could detect boredom in the classroom. When kids are bored in a classroom, they tend to tune out whatever lesson is being taught and then struggle to try to figure it out later. Boredom has a devastating consequence on today's students such as low test scores and poor grades. Prof. Huang predicts the Facial Action Coding System will help with this issue, saying ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Teachers being able to see how their students are feeling would give them more insight to create lesson plans to engage all students and bring up test grades and overall GPA rates.

The Facial Action Coding System isn't only useful in grade school through high school, it would also be beneficial in colleges and post-degree programs. The emotion detector would be very useful in the law enforcement schooling and in Med School. In the law enforcement, professionals are often called to do interrogations and questionings of suspects and witnesses. The Facial Action Coding System could work hand in hand with lie detectors to make sure interrogators could get the full truth out of suspects. This would also help in their schooling by training future cops to be able to read key facial expressions for different feelings. According to Prof. Huang, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", making this resource vital for cop trainees to fully understand how to properly get information out of suspects. In Med School, this software could immensely help future surgeons in their practice. Prof. Huang said, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" This could teach our future surgeons the different muscles of the face for possible surgical procedures and teach them how to read their patients emotions. Having this knowledge could help doctors find out how uncomfortable patients are pain wise and even how to properly help patients. Doctors need to have good communication skills to make sure their patients is properly cared for and having the Facial Action Coding System in Med School would greatly help surgeons in their training.

The success rates of students would increase with Prof. Huang's emotion detector in classrooms around the world. The Facial Action Coding System is vital resource of the future. It has immense potential to better the schooling of the future generation and has great potential for the advancement of the professional fields of work.  ",0,863
"Dear Mr. Senator,

It has come to my, as well as many other's attention, that the presidential election is something that could potentially have disastrous outcomes. You, and many politicians like yourself, have been using a system called the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter have been suggesting to demolish for years now. Personally, I find it quite alarming that although this process has been with us for all of this time, we have found the flaws yet still continue to take the risks. This is not simply about picking a president anymore, this is about the freedom of America.

All in all, the Electoral College at face value seems like a good idea for choosing a winner. It seems to make sense that we would choose electors who the president trusts that would elect him president, but when you think about it, something feels rather off. First, the public places their ballots in the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates. In reality, however, they are voting for their electors instead. Most people who vote are unaware of this factor, and the lack of information pertaining to it is unsettling. Not only that, but the electors are not chosen by the people. Does this not contradict ""By the people, for the people?"" Where exactly do these people fit in?

Furthermore, the electors cannot always be trusted with voting for their respective candidates. This is something referred to as the disaster factor. While most who are picked by the candidate themselves are trustworthy, electors are people who are not in office, therefore may not be as trusting. Electors are an uncertain factor and in some complex cases, even two slates for electors can be sent which could create a hectic mess. If you are going to vote for a president who you wish to win, and your vote goes to an elector that won't come through, it takes all the power away from the people and places it right back into the state's hands.

Another thing to consider when pondering the validity of this process is the potential of a tie with electoral voting. In this case, the election would be in the power of the House of Representatives, and the representatives from each state would decide the winner. We have had many opportunities for a tie during the elections, one even being the difference of 5,559 in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii. The problem with this is the loss of power within the nation. Once again, the people will no longer have a say in the voting and the energy it took them to decide on a candidate and go out to vote will be for virtually nothing. The people will no longer be represented. If something like this were to happen to our country, surely people from every state would be outraged.

Now, you may be thinking to yourself, why should I be worried? Sure, it is unlikely to get a tie in the electoral votes. However, something as huge as deciding the leader of this country should not have even a single flaw in it. Horrible and unexpected things happen every day, why couldn't we get a tie as well? Now, the main problem with getting rid of the Electoral College is the possibility of run-off elections. In defense of this, the Electoral College is the main reason that we have run-off elections in the first place. It prevents people in certain areas from voting because they feel as if they will have no say in the final result. Even if people still voted for the fun of it, it was only because of chance or political preference. With an election by popular vote, the chances of a run-off election would be significantly lower than people would realize the power they had in deciding it.

As you finish reading this, I ask you to consider all the points I have made. I am certain that choosing to elect by popular vote would have more benefits than sticking to the old and flawed plan, the Electoral College. Endless proof points to the conclusion that this theory is correct, as the process of picking electors to elect the president is redundant and confusing. Finally, with all the things that could go wrong, using a new system would be one step forward in making our nation even greater.

"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, but I'll give it a shot! Here's my essay:

Taking guidance from experts and authorities is super important in life. They know way more than we do, and they can help us make better decisions. Like, have you ever been trying to decide which college to go to? Or which career path to take? It's hard to make those decisions on your own, especially when there are so many options. But if you ask someone who's been there and done that, they can give you perfect advice.

I know this from personal experience. Last year, I was trying to decide which extracurricular activity to join. There were so many to choose from, and I was like, ""Ugh, I don't know which one is best for me!"" But then my older sister, who's in high school now, told me about this awesome club that she's in. She said it's really fun, and it's helped her make new friends. So I decided to give it a try, and it's been great! I've met some really cool people, and I'm learning new things. If I hadn't asked my sister for advice, I might still be stuck trying to decide what to do.

Another reason why it's good to take guidance from experts and authorities is that they can help you avoid making mistakes. Like, have you ever heard of the phrase ""experience is the best teacher""? It's totally true! If you ask someone who's already been through something, they can tell you what to watch out for and how to avoid making the same mistakes. For example, if you're trying to get a part-time job, your parents or older siblings can tell you about their own experiences and help you figure out how to be successful.

Of course, it's also important to listen to your own instincts and make your own decisions. But asking for guidance from experts and authorities can really help you out. They can give you a fresh perspective and help you make better choices. So, next time you're trying to make an important decision, don't be afraid to ask for help!

That's my essay. I hope you liked it! Let me know if",1,865
"The advantages of car limiting car usage is simple. The passage"" In German Suburb, Life goes on without cars "". It says the Vauban's families do not even own a car anymore, because when I had a car I was always tense, but I'm much happier this way without a car. Also passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car-intensive ares in the United States. They are also trying to change the suburbs Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. This would be the most advanced experiment in the low-car suburban life. And have been adopted all around the world to make suburbs more compact and more accessible all around the world.

Next,"" the passage Paris bans driving due to smog"". TT talks about how after days of near-record polluting, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air global city. Even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. Also congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying the some.

And the passage car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá. Is talks about some great ways to limiting car usage. Have a free car day is where u can just get out have fun while doing all different types of actives like hiking, go ride on a bike, and even go swimming, this is the stuff that millions of the Colombians did some even to took buses to work during that day. End got to work early not considering the traffic jams that they us to have. The only thing that are permitted on this car free day is the buses in the taxis the gas station was even close. This day was for a good because the goal was to alternative transportation and reduce smog. I think it also give u bounding time with your family. And a good way and opportunity to take away stress and Lowe air pollution.

Finally, in the end to a car culture."" President Obama's ambitious goals are to curb the United States'greenhouse gas emissions ""a good this is that recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. But people are also thinking how! When the united States is the birthplace of the model T some explanations are that. Because of the cash-strapped Americans could not afford a new car and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway.  ",0,866
"""Alright class, you have a summer assignment that you will need to complete by the start of next school year.""

For many high school students, that quote is often what teachers will say to them at the end of the year.

It is not uncommon for a teacher to give out a summer assignment, especially in math or AP, or Advanced Placement, courses.

These projects can help to prevent loss of knowledge during the summer months, while students are not in school, or even just help the student to warm up their brain.

These projects should be teacher-designed, because student-designed projects will likely not help learning much, it makes grading easier on the teacher, and it helps the students to know what to expect from the class.

Students, just as electricity, will pick the path of the least resistance.

That means that students will almost always choose the easiest way to complete an assignment.

That is one of the reasons that students will cheat.

I know a few friends that will cheat on most of their assignments, just because it is often easier than doing the work.

Because of that, the projects that students choose to complete will not be beneficial to their learning.

The student-designed projects would instead be ones that are the easiest to complete, not what benefits learning for the student.

For example, when students are told to make a story using certain elements of their choice, most students will only use those elements that are simplest and nothing more.

Because of that, the students may not get as much experience of writing a story with more complex, yet more beneficial elements.

If students are told to do a summer project, that they have the choice as to what to do, then they will choose what is easiest and not most beneficial to their learning.

If instead a teacher decides the project, then the student will have to use those more beneficial elements.

Also, if the teacher has to make how the students create their projects so complicated, then the teacher might as well just create the project.

Whenever I have to do a project that involves multiple different choices, and the rubric is very vague as a result, I often can not tell if what I have done is an A+ work.

I specifically had to do a project on

The Catcher in the Rye, where I had to choose between multiple choices including an essay or various different visual projects.

The rubric on that wasn't very helpful when I was trying to figure out if I had done an A+ work, because it did not include much specifically about the project that I chose. While that might be fine when I already know the teacher, so I can ask them, it would be much harder during the summer to know if it is excellent work.

Because of this, the students would either just not care that much about the project and just do what they think is the bare minimum, or they would be pressed into doing two miles instead of the only one-mile needed for the project.

While this may be beneficial to the learning sometimes, it would also create much stress that would hinder the student's learning as well as life.

Along with this, because of the vague rubric, the teacher may have a different idea of what constitutes a good project than the student.

If the project is designed by the teacher and the rubric are more specific, then that discrepancy does not exist.

And then, because the rubric is more specific, the teacher would be able to grade it on more objective rather than subjective elements, meaning that all the teacher would have to do is follow a checklist to grade it, rather than vague guidelines as to what to look for.

This would make teachers lives easier, especially just after getting back from summer break.

Another benefit with the teacher-designed project is that it allows the students to know what to expect from the class.

For example, when I was in AP World History, I had to outline the first three chapters of the textbook as a summer assignment.

It was very long and specific work, but it helped me to learn about how the class was going to be a lot of outlining, as well that the class would have most of the notes done outside of class.

If a teacher were to assign a project that involved coloring and such, then the student would be able to reasonably guess that the class would have a lot of coloring and drawing.

Or if the assessment were to be that the student should read and annotate

The Crucible, then the student would expect that there would be a lot of reading and annotating in that class.

If the project were student designed, then the student would not have that advantage of knowing what to expect in the course.

A student may realize when doing the summer project that the class would be far too strenuous for them, if so, then they can change their class to an easier class before school starts.

Students do not always pick the easiest projects, so it may not be the most beneficial for their learning to design their own.

The lack of specific guidelines on the project may make it harder on the teacher to grade, as well as harder on the student to know what is the work needed to get the highest grade.

As well, the nature of the project may give the student insight into what the class is going to be like.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student designed, because students will not pick projects helpful to their learning, teachers and students can have an easier time knowing what is going to get the highest grade, and it helps the student to know what the class will be like.

After all, the teacher is the one who is teaching the class.",0,867
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home than at school? I believe taking classes online at home could be very beneficial, because you wouldn't have to worry about getting distracted by other students like you would at school. You'd be able to advance at your own pace, meaning you won't have to rush at everything. Lastly, you wouldn't have to be so stressed from all the homework you get from each teacher in each class, but everything has its disadvantages as well.

I'd like to start by saying that not being distracted from your class is great, most students get easily distracted by others. Anything that makes you lose your focus during class is considered a distraction, which includes even cellphones. If you don't pay attention to class your most likely going to end up getting lost and fail, but when you're at home doing your work online by yourself you wouldn't have to worry about this.

Another benefit from being able to attend class at home, would buy that you can move at your own pace. This is a big benefit, for example at school I have to follow the teachers pace and sometimes when the teacher moves to fast on a subject I end up confused and lost making me fail the test or not doing good on the homework. At home, you could take your time to process and understand the subject before moving on to a different one. Helping you do a lot better.

My final reason would be less stress. I say this because I'm stressing right now to keep up my good grades. I get too much homework and most of the time I don't get time to do it because of work or family. Furthermore, I'm the oldest at home and I have to take care of my siblings, which means having to make food for them, clean up the house making sure everyone's ok. Making me not do homework after school. Most of the time I have to stay up late doing homework. I wouldn't have to worry about this if I did everything online making me less stressed.

I have given you three reasons on how doing your classes online can be beneficial, but there are also some disadvantages. One of them could be not interacting with other students. I know that earlier I had said others can become a distraction but that's during class after class it's nice talking to others, everything has its time and place. Another disadvantage could be that you may need help with something, and you won't be able to have someone to help. At school, we have our teachers and when your stuck with something they can help you by explaining it in other words to make it sound more simple. So, there our benefits on having class online but also disadvantages.

I end this essay by saying that I still believe taking online classes at home can benefit you a lot, But everyone has their own way of learning. If your more of an independent person than I would recommend taking online classes but if your more of a social person than stay in school. All that matters is that you pass your class.",0,868
"Changing the school menu can be a controversial topic, as it has both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, it is undeniable that nutrition is important, especially for growing children. Introducing a more varied and balanced menu would offer students the proper assortment of nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, children are more likely to taste new foods when their peers are trying them as well. This could help students be more adventurous eaters, resulting in healthier long-term dietary habits.

On the other hand, there is a risk of unfamiliar foods being met with negative responses. Many students resist change and may be unwilling to try new meals, particularly those which are not part of their culture or personal likes. Furthermore, the cost of introducing higher-quality ingredients may put financial strain on families, especially those whose budgets are already stretched thin. Finally, dining hall staff may need additional training to prepare the food, resulting in additional expenses.

In conclusion, while changing the school menu has the potential to bring multiple benefits to students, it is necessary to consider the potential drawbacks as well. Ultimately, the decision of whether to proceed with changing the school menu must be the result of careful deliberation and research on the topic.",1,869
" I believe that allowing students to bring their phones to school is a necessary step in ensuring that they are always connected to their families and can quickly respond to any emergencies that may arise. In addition, bringing phones to school can also improve the overall school environment by providing students with a sense of comfort and security.

One of the main reasons that I believe this is the case is that emergencies can happen at any time, and it is important that students are able to quickly communicate with their families in the event of an emergency. For example, if a student's parent is involved in an accident, they need to be able to quickly reach out to their family for support and guidance. This is especially true for students who live far away from their families or who may not have access to a landline.

Another reason that I believe allowing students to bring their phones to school is that it can improve the school environment by providing students with a sense of comfort and security. This is especially true for students who may be struggling with anxiety or other mental health issues. Having access to their phone can provide them with a sense of connection to their support network and can help to alleviate some stress and anxiety that they may be feeling.

In addition to these practical reasons, allowing students to bring their phones to school can also be a powerful tool for improving the overall school environment. By providing students with a sense of connection to their families and support networks, schools can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment that is more likely to attract and retain students.

Overall, I believe that allowing students to bring their phones to school is a necessary step in ensuring that they are always connected to their families and can quickly respond to any emergencies that may arise. By providing students with a sense of comfort and security, schools can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment that is more likely to attract and retain students.",1,870
"Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to our society, ranging from tackling issues like greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving public health and creating more sustainable communities. The success stories of car-free neighborhoods and cities around the world show that it is possible to live without cars and still maintain a high quality of life. By adopting smarter urban planning, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and changing cultural perceptions about car ownership, we can create a future where cars are no longer the sole means of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study cited in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars contribute to about 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car dependency, we can make a significant impact on reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help combat air pollution, which is a major concern in many cities around the world. In her article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" Robert Duffer discusses how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to tackle high pollution levels. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and highlighted the role cars play in polluting our environment. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier cities for everyone.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also improve public health. Andrew Silky's article ""Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogotá"" shows how the car-free day in Bogotá, Colombia, has promoted alternative transportation and encouraged people to adopt healthier habits like hiking, biking, and skating. By making our cities more walkable and accessible to public transportation, we can encourage physical activity and reduce the risk of sedentary lifestyles and related health issues.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. In her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal discusses how Americans are driving less and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift, coupled with smarter urban planning and the development of alternative transportation options, can lead to the creation of vibrant communities with improved access to amenities, reduced traffic congestion, and less reliance on fossil fuels.

While some may view limiting car usage as an inconvenience, the success stories from car-free neighborhoods and cities around the world show that it is possible to live without cars and still enjoy a high quality of life. By adopting a comprehensive approach that includes smarter urban planning, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and changing cultural perceptions about car ownership, we can create a future where cars are no longer the only means of getting around. The advantages of limiting car usage, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving public health and creating sustainable communities, make it a worthwhile endeavor for the betterment of our society and the planet.",1,871
"Dear senator,

Imagine it being the year for choosing for a new president for the United States of America. You cast your vote, for which president you thought that would be best to run our country. After, you hear the results you become very disappointed, Because the president won not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. You become very angry and frustrated because the president that will now be running for America will not better our country by the things he said. Reasoning, that he won by the electoral college and not by popular vote, and you feel as if you don't feel as if it was not fair because you're not really choosing based on the state laws and how the electors are selected. How would you feel if you were in a situation like this ?

Furthermore, I think we should change the election by popular vote for the President of the United States of America. My reasoning being said is because when the president wins by popular vote it's from what the American citizens want, not what the electors chose. When you choose by popular vote you also avoid many other things from occurring. For example, the electoral college is a method of selecting the president that may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. As explained in the text""  voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.""

Moreover, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Candidates don't spend as time in states they know they have no chance of winning, and only focusing on the states that they do. As said in the text"" In a 2000 campaign, seventeen states don't see the candidates at all, including in Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. Making that hard for the people to see what there president wants to do for the country they have no idea because of the candidate too worried on winning and letting the citizens choose.

To elaborate on my claim, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The disaster factor is what happened in the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century, which allows the system for much worse. In the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors would affect the will of the citizens. Sometimes ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please."" Making another reason why the electoral college shouldn't be here to stay.

Although, keeping the electoral college may not be a good thing to do.  ",0,872
"As I dug into the personal stories of successful people, one common theme stood out – their resilience in the face of failure. Whether it was Mark Zuckerberg learning to code after multiple failed attempts to launch a software company, or J.K. Rowling persisting despite rejection of her Harry Potter manuscripts, there’s something to be learned from their perseverance.  

I was reminded of my own experiences of coming up short and using those moments as a springboard for growth. As I processed these feelings, I was able to reflect on how failure has shaped me as a person and pushed me farther down the path that led me to success. 

I identified the ways that failure had contributed to my own growth and the impact it had on helping me reach my goals. I realized that to stay focused and motivated, it was important to create an environment that nurtured learning and positive self-belief. 

Furthermore, I was grateful for the support of my family and friends, who provided me with the encouragement and emotional support to stay the course. Through the combination of stumbling, finding solutions, and never giving up, I was able to take failure in stride, to ride the wave of success.",1,873
"I believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable. There are six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These emotions can be shown an identified due to your facial and bone structure when showing one of these emotions. For example your frontal is pars laterals muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised. When you get angry your orbicularis Boris tightens your lips to show anger.

I believe that the use of technology to shows peoples emotions is valuable. This can be very helpful to professors giving one-hour lectures. This can show the professor if the students are bored or confused. Meaning if the professor is award of one of these emotions they can help the student or make the lecture interesting. Doing either one of these things can change the students emotions drastic. Another thing we can check up on, is if the student is engaged with the teachers teaching abilities. We would also be able to see if the students are angry at one another, happy, or maybe even disgusted. Identifying emotions can help the professor, but it can also help out other students. If the students were able to tell what these emotions are, then school drama would decrease in a way. For example lets say a student was disgusted or angered at some student the person could easily ignore him or prevent making eye contact with him. Getting into a serious note lets talk about school shooters. If we were able to see how an angered lonely kid feels, we would help him, and we could prevent them from making a traffic mistake. This could prevent strategies from happening around the world. Where a no hearted pathetic animal goes and shoots up a school.

So in my opinion I agree with using technology to show peoples emotions. Not only can this make class fun, but it can also help people that are headed to a path of destruction and hatred. This would be able to help a majority of people not just the ones I included. ",0,874
"Dear Senator [Your Senator's Name],

I am writing as a concerned citizen of our great state of [Your State]. I write to you today to voice my support for maintaining the Electoral College system, utilized since the inception of our great nation, to elect our presidents. While some argue this system is outdated, its continued use ensures a more balanced representation across the country, which is a paramount democratic principle.

The Electoral College system was introduced by our founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of Federal Registrar). The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures a balanced representation where regions do not have enough electoral votes to elect a president single-handedly thus requiring a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal (Poster).

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair to voters as candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the “swing” states (Plume). However, the Electoral College system mitigates the risk of regionalism because a single region never possesses enough electoral votes to elect a president (Poster). This ensures every region of our vast and diverse country has its voice heard and its interests taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College also allows elections to avoid complications possibly coming from a candidate not receiving a majority of votes, since it usually produces a clear winner (Poster).

Some also argue that the Electoral College is unfair since it allows for a president to be elected without winning the popular vote, as seen during the 2000 election between Gore and Bush (Plume). While this case indicates the possibility of such occurrences, they rarely happen, and are a small price to pay for maintaining fair representation of all regions of our vast country (Poster).

Maintaining the Electoral College system also helps prevent a crisis in the event of a tie vote. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible but highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all basis state electoral votes (Poster). There is stark certainty in results since the winners' Electoral College vote usually surpass their popular vote (Poster).

In conclusion, while the implementation of a national popular vote may seem appealing on the surface, a deeper exploration shows us that the Electoral College is an essential system to our democracy. It represents the very essence of our federalism and provides a balance of power ensuring all citizens, regardless of their geographic location, have a voice. Therefore, I firmly stand with the continuation of the Electoral College and I hope you can take this into consideration when such issues arise in the Senate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"Dear Principal,

I am all for community service. If students are required to do different services we will become a better community. Say, if 10 students pick up garbage around the community each day it will become cleaner. If we have students to tutor the younger children in elementary, we are sure to see there grades and scores change. Also, for them to do better in school.

I can also see how some students would not want to do this. Some students are dedicated to sports or clubs. Which means that they have school then practice/ meetings right after. Once they get home they have to do all there homework or study for a test. Understanding they have chores and other stuff to do at home. Some students do not have a lot of time at all.

If you really want us to help out our community you could make it an extra class for college credits or bonus for a class. Doing this would make students want to help out a lot more. It's a win, win situation. The community is becoming cleaner and more joined as a whole. While students are earning better grades and getting credits for college.

As you can see, our community and students can gain from this. It's just how we reward the students for there service. Of course, if you help them out with college or to get better grades they are going to want to do it. On the other hand if you don't reward them with anything, fewer students are going to want to help out the community.

I am thinking this could really work.

I really hope you take into consideration my views on the issue. Furthermore, I am hoping to see the community change for the better. Not the worst. Thank you for all of your time!",0,876
"There are a few reasons why it might be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. First, having broad knowledge gives you a more well-rounded perspective on the world. You are able to see the connections between different fields of study and understand how they all fit together. This can help you come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. Second, specializing in one subject can often lead to tunnel vision. You may become so focused on learning everything about your subject that you lose sight of the big picture. This can make it difficult to come up with new ideas or see alternate solutions to problems. Third, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make you more versatile and valuable to employers. You will be able to work in a variety of different fields and be able to understand complex concepts. Finally, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help you develop a better critical thinking skills.

"Dear Senator,

I write to you today to present a few arguments in favor of retaining the current Electoral College system for the Presidential elections in the United States. 

The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers of our Nation, represents a compromise between Presidential election by Congress and that by a popular vote (Paragraph 1). It promotes a balanced national perspective by requiring a Presidential candidate to appeal to various regions because no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president outright (Paragraph 19).

The oft-cited problem with the Electoral College system is the potential for a candidate to win the national popular vote but lose the presidency, but such occurrences are historically infrequent (Paragraph 16). Contrarily, the system offers notable advantages such as the certainty of outcome. Because most states adopt a 'winner-take-all' method in awarding electoral votes, it often results in the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeding their share of the popular vote (Paragraph 18).

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages keen voter engagement in 'swing' states, which are naturally pivotal in deciding elections. Voters in these states, being directly mindful of their impact, become more informed and engaged (Paragraph 20). 

Critics of the Electoral College argue it is unfair and outdated, citing perceived flaws such as candidates neglecting non-competitive states and the possibility of 'faithless' electors (Paragraphs 13 and 14). While these concerns warrant attention, they can be addressed within the existing framework through state-by-state reforms, such as the implementations done by Maine and Nebraska, which distribute electoral votes proportionally (Paragraph 7).

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, while having its imperfections, performs the vital function of maintaining geographical balance and ensuring proper representation. The benefits of retaining the Electoral College far outweigh the disadvantages and hold significant relevance in the modern political context.

Thank you for your time.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I believe that cell phones should be allowed at school. There are a lot of people that get sick or need to call there parents for an emergency. A lot of people have a sickness and need special vitamins and pills and their parent need to bring it to them. Also, break and lunch is their free time to get away from work and teachers to do something else but work. In that free time they may use their phone.

Most kids are responsible enough to put away their phone in class. The parents get the kids a phone for a reason. They trust their kid with it so why can't the schools. The phone isn't doing anything to the schools. It isn't messing with other kids. So why can't we just bring them to school and use them only during break, lunch and for emergency's. Policy number one is the best choice for this situation.

"Dear principal,

I think you should let us students to bring our cell phones to school because we are in a growing society, and we all need to communicate.

To begin with I consider all students must have a cell phone in order to text their classmate to ask about the homework from last night. Or just to have a brief talk about the test in class that they are giving or just to let the students have more freedom. Also texting is being more widely used than any other devise in earth like face book or twitter they are both being used to talk on the phones know everybody has a phone I am right yes because technology has been growing rapidly and faster than ever know on days you don't see that device what was it called oh yea the beeper because it took so much time to call the one typing it in and for her to send the message to the other person beeper that has become obsolete.

Also phones have been one of the world's the greatest inventions. In fact the on who created the first phone was Alexander gram bell and know look at the phones they even have GPS. They can take you to their destination without problem is like the sexton that used triangulation to find your position in earth. But know they use seven GPS to know where you are and where are you going now they are more accurate they take anywhere any time any place. Phones have developed allot know there even a hand free devise that you use that is not even a cord is just dangling from your ear and it its totally cool to have one I have one.

"**Driverless Cars**

Driverless cars are a new technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel. Some people believe that driverless cars are the future of transportation, while others are concerned about the safety and ethical implications of this technology. In this essay, I will argue that the development of driverless cars should be stopped because they are a threat to public safety and the jobs of millions of people.

**Safety**

The most important reason to oppose the development of driverless cars is the threat they pose to public safety. Driverless cars are still in their early stages of development, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to operate safely on public roads. In fact, a recent study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that driverless cars were involved in more accidents than human-driven cars.

**Jobs**

Another reason to oppose the development of driverless cars is the threat they pose to the jobs of millions of people. Driverless cars could eliminate the need for millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and other transportation workers. This would have a devastating impact on the economy and the lives of millions of people.

**Conclusion**

For these reasons, I believe that the development of driverless cars should be stopped. Driverless cars are a threat to public safety and the jobs of millions of people. We should focus on developing safer and more efficient transportation technologies that do not put people at risk.",1,882
"I do agree that students should be in extracurricular activity, because they would enjoy them self with their friends, and they can help each other out, when they need help learn how to play the sport if you don't know how to play, and just have fun together with your friends in school.

Students don't participate and the activity if they don't want to participate, they can stay in class with the teacher and do something with the teacher or the can help set up the activity, y but when it's time to play they have to go back in the class with the teachers and other students.

"In today's society, there is much debate over whether it is better to be constantly active or if inactivity can also be useful. When it comes to staying on track in school, working hard like a parent, and getting things done like a soccer player, staying active is a great way to ensure success. By remaining active, one can stay focused, be productive, and be motivated—all of which are important components of success.

On the other hand, there are some steps that require inactivity in order to be effective. Taking the time to rest and reflect is just as important as actively working towards goals. Taking restorative breaks and allowing yourself to take a break will help maintain your mental and physical health, which can give you the energy and motivation you need to succeed.

In conclusion, I believe that both being active and occasionally allowing yourself to slow down have their place when it comes to accomplishing more. Staying active is important for staying focused and motivated, while taking breaks is important for maintaining your health and energy. Both of these strategies, used in balance, can help you reach your goals.",1,884
"On May 24, 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars while taking photos of possible landing sites. As it was taking photos, it noticed a dome that resembled a human face. The face was nearly two miles in diameter and it appeared to be staring back at the cameras from an area of the Red Planet called Colonia. Some say that this is evidence of life on Mars.

In paragraph 2, they tell us that the sensation was short-lived. It also says that scientists assumed it was just another Martian Mesa because it was so common around Colonia. This one had shadows that made is look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. They should not have come to the conclusion that there is life on Mars only because they saw shadows that resembled a humans facial structure.

In paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998,

Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took photos that would come out 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument. If there really was an alien monument to begin with, it surely would have appeared the second time around, especially because they used a much better camera.

In paragraph 12, it says that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. Gavin states that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The Face on Mars is most likely a natural landform. Martian mesas are common around the Colonia area, so it could have easily been mistaken for what appeared to be a human face. They claim to have seen evidence of life based on shadows that appeared on a natural landform. This seems very unrealistic. Michael Main and his Orbiter Camera team took photos using a camera that would leave pictures 10 times sharper than the original Viking pictures, so if anything was actually on Mars, we surely would have seen it.",0,885

"In this essay I'm going to give you my opinion about the electoral college. My first reason is i don't think a few 100 people should pick the president, I think the entire nation should pick the president. Secondly we don't even get the chance to vote for a president we get to vote for a slate of electors. Ur votes might not count. Those are my reasons.

I don't think a few 100 random citizens should pick the president, I think the people should because what if the entire nation votes for one person but, the few 100 people vote for someone else. With only a few hundred electors a rich person could bribe them into choosing who they wanted, and it could be someone who got no votes. It is unfair this country has 100s of millions of people and to leave it up to 370 people is preposterous.

Secondly we don't get to vote for the president and the electoral college says oh well they voted for him so lets pick him, no we vote for slate of electors who vote for whoever the feel like and sometimes there random people.

Thirdly you vote don't count lets just say u live in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the state wide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office.

So overall Bob dole was right abolish the electoral college!  ",0,887
"Dear State Senator,

I don't truly have a major problem dealing with the electoral college, its just that I believe that changing it to a popular vote of the president would be easier. Its kind of unnecessary to have as many elections for all these different levels. It all takes far too long to decide which candidate would better suit this country. I understand it all has to be fair but its better having the popular vote.

When the past leaders of this country were trying to abolish the electoral college, i don't think they were wrong for that. If you believe something isn't right, and you're not the only one who believes the same as you, than there must be something wrong. It isn't fair if you win the popular vote and end up losing because of the electoral college. If you really think about it, the electoral college really has the say so of the entire election. So why involve the citizens of this country if what they say don't mean anything at all.

Another important thing is that, the electors that are elected by the state could always defy the will of the people(paragraph 11). For example: the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy. This is absolutely outrageous that someone could lose the opportunity to be president all because of the electors not approving. It's like when your says you can do something, but the principle says no.

The only time an electoral college is necessary is if the presidential race is at a tie with the number of votes and it's all on the electoral college. The electoral college shouldn't have to be involved if the race isn't a tie and is going smooth. It's like sticking your nose in someone's business, or getting involved in something that doesn't concern you. The electoral college is just a big instigator.

So in conclusion, there is no need for the electoral college. It causes too much controversy and shouldn't be brought into play unless a tie has occurred. The presidential race should run smoothly on popular vote.  ",0,888
"Professor Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois has made a great leap in technology that can recognize the emotions one might project. With his colleagues, Prof. Huang developed the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. It utilizes human anatomy to help identify the intensity of emotions and what range of emotions one might feel. As facial emotions are universal in the muscles that are engaged to produce those emotions, having this technology in different environments can help with productivity and learning. An application of FACS can prove useful in a school environment, as it can provide tailored learning, emotional aid through school counseling, and can aid in learning anatomy.

As proposed in paragraph 6, the use of FACS can allow for tailored learning through web camera software. If the software can be used to detect the emotions on the faces of students, it can identify the emotions associated with success and frustration. If the facial scan sees that a student is struggling with an assignment or is frustrated with it, the lesson plan and the problems given can be altered to maximize what is learned as mentioned in paragraph 6 with Prof. Huang writing, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This application can aid struggling students and familiarize students with the given material, meaning that the students can further comprehend the lesson given. For students are exceeding the requirements for the assignment, emotions of happiness could allow for students to face a challenge with tougher problems than the ones given previously.

As seen in the paragraph above, FACS can aid in online learning, but it can also help with emotional help provided by a school counselor. Though it is a profession that entails the analysis of emotion in teenagers, emotions can be tough to read for even the most experienced in the field. FACS could play a big role in identifying what emotions students might have in the name of bettering their life. As mentioned in paragraph 5, humans can differentiate between various emotions when looking at the face of a friend or family member. However, the length of that analysis can only go so far to prove what a student is feeling. Employing FACS could help counselors talk one on one with students about what problems they face in school and at home. Talking through these problems can lead to a more positive outlook on life and could allow for more engagement academically regarding the student. As a whole FACS can improve school life and culture.

Lastly, FACS can play a large role in the education of Anatomy, not only in high school, but in college as well. Paragraphs 7-9 provide simple examples of muscles involved in movements that indicate emotions from the zygotic major and rigorous to the orbicularis could pars plpabraeus. Utilizing the FACS can help students identify major muscles and their functions by using different emotional expressions. Since emotion is scientifically proven to be evoked by emotional expression as mentioned in paragraph 9, the results of which emotions are present can be more accurate. Having the ability to identify and associate muscles on a personal level with the aid of machinery allows for the knowledge to be kept with personal association, making FACS very important in this field of education. FACS can help memorize those muscles and retain knowledge about their function from a simple facial analysis.

An application of FACS can prove useful in a school environment, as it can provide tailored learning, aid in school counseling, and aid in learning Anatomy. As explored in the paragraphs above, FACS provides a wide range of opportunities for schools to engage in different forms of learning and measuring progress with its aid. With a universal impact in many aspects of school life, FACS can revolutionize what teachers and counselors think is best for students. The software provides a scope of use not limited to just science, but to schools and companies who can utilize FACS for learning and for projects in the future.",0,889

"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to prioritize its continuation in our presidential elections. While some argue in favor of replacing it with a direct popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system that preserves fairness, regional representation, and the certainty of outcome.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. This is vital to maintaining the stability and integrity of our democratic process. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3 percent of the popular vote. This demonstrates that the Electoral College prevents close elections from being subject to endless recounts and potential disputes over the popular vote. Furthermore, due to the winner-takes-all allocation of electoral votes, a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie in the overall electoral vote total.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of our diverse nation has a say in the selection of the President. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College fosters the election of candidates who are truly representative of the entire country. It prevents candidates with only regional popularity from neglecting the interests and concerns of other regions. By having each state's electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in that state, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of regional preferences.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome is uncertain and every vote matters. In a direct popular vote system, candidates would have no incentive to campaign in states they know they have no chance of winning, which would result in the neglect and disregard of certain states and their issues. This would leave many voters feeling disenfranchised and their interests ignored. By having a system that rewards candidates for engaging with swing states, the Electoral College guarantees that campaigns are conducted across a wide range of states, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the nation's opinions and concerns.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of large states against small states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In a presidential campaign, large states receive more attention than small states due to their higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and perspectives of Americans living in both large and small states. Without the Electoral College, candidates would likely focus exclusively on heavily populated areas, ignoring the needs and interests of rural and less populous areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps prevent the need for run-off elections. By designating a clear winner based on the majority of electoral votes, it avoids potential complications and delays that would arise from run-off elections. This ensures a smooth transition of power and guarantees that the president-elect has a legitimate mandate to govern.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democratic system. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes regional representation, encourages candidates to engage with swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is a fair and effective method for electing our president and should be retained to preserve the integrity and stability of our electoral process.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I implore you to keep the Electoral College intact and resist calls for a direct popular vote. I trust that you will make decisions that uphold the principles of our constitution and serve the best interests of our great nation.

Sincerely,

"Summer assignments should be designed by the student with the whole student body in mind. The point of school is to prepare and benefit an individual for the remainder of their life in society. With this in mind, school work should be universally understood by the student so that everyone is in mind and everyone has an equal opportunity. What better way for an assignment to be understood if it's created by the student? Students know themselves and their peers more than teachers do, so it would be best if students made a project that would suit them best.

A summer assignment is more of a pain than the usual assignment because it takes away precious time from the summer, so in order to make the project less of a chore, it would lift the spirit of the student if it was them in charge of what the work load could be. The student wouldn't see it as much of a woeful task, but rather a commitment they themselves made. If its more personalized, then students would take more time and dedication to work on the assignment. It would feel more like a prompt that would be in their best interest to better themselves and not a school issued worksheet.

Also, a student designed project would benefit the teachers, too. They wouldn't have to take the time out of their busy schedule to produce a lengthy assignment, and having a teacher designed one would make it more standardized and less suitable to the audience it is targeting. It would be mundane and frankly, acrimonious for a teacher to grade an assignment they created, especially depending on how many students are doing the project. It would be a relief for the teacher and would prove that their students are responsible and ambitious enough to create and work on a school assignment that proves their own worth as a student.

In my personal experience with summer assignments, the school has always issued work designed by the county. This has proved to be not that efficient of a task, because most of my classmates failed to complete, or even attempt to do the summer project because it was so daunting, and the fact that it was to be done over the summer made it worse. I'll even admit I didn't finish any of my summer assignments either for that same reason. The teachers speak of summer assignments with much vicar, thus showing that both teacher and student loath the project. Now there would be a different outcome if it was student designed. The student would have completed it since it was a project that they committed to, and the teacher would see it as a task that builds the character of a student.

A student designed project is in many ways a better alternative to teacher designed ones. It's an assignment benefits everyone involved. Students would likely finish to project in a shorter time since it would hold their attention. It is a task that gets a student prepared for the following year, and what better way to have a teacher introduced to a student by grading a piece of work created by the student themselves. A student designed summer assignment is the only way to go.",0,893
"Did any of the schools you attended as a child offer distance learning? Would you be interested in participating in distance learning? Schools are now offering distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools believe that there are benefits to distance learning, however there are various problems with the system of distance learning. Distance learning is not beneficial for students because it will not prepare them for the set-up of college, they are not going to be able to interact or learn how to work with their peers, and they are more likely to get easily distracted when learning from home.

One way that distance learning would not be beneficial for students is because it will not prepare them for the set-up of college. In almost all colleges, the classes offered are in large lecture halls where you are face to face with the teacher and other students, and not separated by a screen. By participating in distance learning students may not be prepared for face to face interaction with their teacher and the other students. For example, my brother, who is now a senior in college, participated in a system similar to distance learning while he was in school. After having participated in online and video conferencing classes for almost all of his school career, he had a much harder time adjusting to the college style of teaching than the other students, from his same high school, that did not participate in distance learning. Another way that distance learning would not help students prepare for the set-up of college is that the students that participate in distance learning will have trouble adjusting to having to leave their house to attend class. In college classes are not offered inside of dorms and students will have to travel outside their living area. If students do not practice taking classes outside their home in high school they may feel uncomfortable learning in an unfamiliar environment and that could affect their learning abilities when they get to college.

Another downside to the distance learning system is that students would not have daily interaction or learn how to work with their peers. In school, you meet many new people from around your town that may have very different cultural or ethnic backgrounds. If students were to participate in distance learning, although they would meet various other peers through activities like sports, clubs, or their hobbies, they would not meet as many people as they would if they were also in a classroom with twenty to thirty other kids. Because of this limited interaction with other kids their age, these students who participate in distance learning may not learn how to interact and collaborate with other students. For example, my brother had a difficult time making friends in college because he had little experience interacting with other children that he didn't already know and have a relationship with. He also struggled in group projects because he had not participated in one since elementary school, when he began distance learning. Not learning how to collaborate with others can be detrimental for a student because that will be a major part of their lives after they finish school. Whether they use the skill of interacting with other people in their future job, or even just to make to new friends after moving to a new town, the skill of interacting with others is very valuable and important to possess.

The final reason that distance learning is not beneficial to students is that it allows students to become more easily distracted. In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However, if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because there is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also there is fewer distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I had completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.

Distance learning is not beneficial to students because it does not prepare them for the set-up of college, they would not be able to learn how to interact and collaborate with their peers, and they are more likely to be easily distracted when learning from home. Although distance learning may provide some benefits to learners who may struggle with learning in a classroom setting, it will ultimately affect them negatively in the future. ",0,894

"Don't Believe Everything

Have you ever believed something that wasn't true? I have, but before you believe it you have to find out if it's true or not. In the article it says the ""face"" looks like it could have been a Martian mesa. Also, the shadows and the lighting could be making it look more like a face. There for if the NASA wanted to go there to get evidence it would cost them a huge budget.

What if the ""face"" was a Martian mesa? It could be one. The NASA was watching it through the years and figured out it looked like it could be a Martian mesa or butte. It was also very common to see Martians around the Colonia, just this one had unusual shadows that made it look different from the other ones. It could all just be a natural landform that looks like a face.

The shadows could be making the Martian look like a face. From the angle where they took the picture. The picture could have changed how the picture came out. The human mind can form shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Some people said it would be a good way to engage the people and attract attention to Mars. Some people can just be fooled by them and thinking it really is a face.

To get evidence from Mars to see if it is really a face would cost NASA a huge budget. Just to go to Mars is a lot, but to go there and get evidence from there and bring it to Earth is a lot. It also can effect the way back to Earth and be dangerous. They don't stop at Colonia, so they would have to plan it out and get all the supplies they would need to get there and get the evidence they need.

People will believe almost anything anyone says. You just got to have evidence to know if it's true or not. There are so many things to make the Martian look like a face. Like meteoroids could have hit it and knock off a piece of it. They could have just got the wrong side, lighting, or shadows of it. So before you believe anything anyone says make sure it's true and not just something made up.  ",0,896
"Ever had a school project that you had to do over the summer? Ever hated a teacher for making you do it? And I know you think that summer is to be not focused on school and to have a break but, school is important and so is focusing on it too. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning their break. I believe these summer projects should be teacher designed. They should be teacher designed to get a head start for next year, over the summer our brains just get caught up in the fun and time off, and it would be more challenging to us if a teacher designed it.

First, it is important to head start for the next year. It would feel amazing to be in the top of your class and finally understand everything your teacher was talking about. In doing so, you could even start to tutor your friends and classmates. I don't know about you but, when ever I get a ""light bulb"" in class, or finally I feel like I know what I'm doing is correct, I feel amazing. Imagine having that feeling in that class most of the time! If you had a summer project that a teacher designed, you could get a head start with the materials and may even learn them better in the process.

Secondly, remember during the school year when you would dream about being on a beach or even just being at home having some rest from school? Don't you want summer to last forever? Everyone misses summer at some point, especially when it's blowing snow outside. Also, remember when August comes around, and you start to dread about going to school? Yeah, me too but, when you have summer projects you can exercise your brain and make it not so hard when you come back to school. I believe if summer projects were student based, nothing would get done. If anything, the bare minimum would get done because kids want to spend time resting and relaxing and not having to worry about anything.

Lastly, it would be more challenging for the students. If you were to make a project over summer, it would be a mess. It would be past due, not done at all, or just not done with enough effort. Most teachers give you this project not to be mean, but to benefit you in the long run. I feel like if a student made a project for themselves, it would not be challenging enough and also, you want a good impression on that teacher that you are hardworking and can go through any challenges that may come your way.

Next time you get a project to do over the summer, be thankful and look at the positives from it. Mostly the teacher isn't trying to be mean and try to ""ruin your summer"" so, don't think of it in that way. You can be a tutor and get some side money while you are at it, you can make a good impression on your teacher, and many more. So, next time you get a project over the summer that the teacher designed just know they are coming from the right place. ",0,897
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" they introduce new technology, but it's not like our phones or computers this technology will be able to detect any emotion you are dealing, rage, love,depression anything that has to do with emotion. They are predicting that this technology will be able to tell whether or not a kid is confused or bored class. This could be good because the teacher might be willing to make up new and improved lessons instead of the same boring old thing.

The reason I am against the Facial Action Coding System is because not everyone should be able to know what I am feeling. My facial expressions might show that I am upset over something so drastic but, its really I didn't get any pasta for dinner last night. Your expressions can read into too much. Then what, what are you supposing to when you find out everyone in your class either bored or upset you can't talk to everyone about their emotions not most people would want to open up, Which is understandable because you didn't come to school to have your teacher read your facial expression and start to analyze everything about you.

Although I am glad we are able to make so much new technology and such high technology like FACS. It is not right to use the technology on students every time they come into a classroom. The Facial Action Coding system should not be used in the classroom.  ",0,898
"The Benefits of a Positive Attitude in Life

A positive attitude is a crucial aspect of life that can greatly impact one's personal and professional success. By adopting a positive mindset, individuals can experience numerous benefits such as increased motivation, better relationships, and improved overall well-being.

One way in which a positive attitude can benefit individuals is by increasing motivation. When individuals have a positive outlook on life, they tend to feel more inspired and driven to achieve their goals. This can lead to increased productivity and a greater sense of accomplishment. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals overcome obstacles and challenges, as they are more likely to view these situations as opportunities for growth and learning.

Another way in which a positive attitude can benefit individuals is by improving their relationships. When individuals have a positive outlook on life, they tend to be more approachable and empathetic towards others. This can lead to better communication and stronger connections with friends, family, and colleagues. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals navigate difficult conversations and conflicts more effectively, as they are more likely to approach these situations with an open mind and a desire to find common ground.

Moreover, a positive attitude can also have a significant impact on one's overall well-being. When individuals have a positive outlook on life, they tend to experience less stress and anxiety, as they are more likely to focus on the positive aspects of their lives. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals develop a greater sense of resilience and self-esteem, which can lead to a more fulfilling and satisfying life.

Examples of Successful People with a Positive Attitude

There are numerous examples of successful individuals who have attributed their success to a positive attitude. One such example is Oprah Winfrey, who has spoken extensively about the importance of maintaining a positive mindset. Winfrey has said that she believes that success is not determined by external factors, but rather by one's internal attitude and perspective.

Another example is Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. Musk has spoken about the importance of having a positive attitude in order to achieve success. He has said that individuals who focus on negative outcomes and setbacks are more likely to fail, while those who maintain a positive attitude and view setbacks as opportunities for growth are more likely to succeed.",1,899
"Dear senator, i believe that the electoral college is beneficial on some levels but people in America still need their rights. I think that they should abolish the electoral college because it's very unfair to voters. And by voters I mean just regular citizens. Not the democratic electors or representative sect. Also even if we vote it doesn't matter because the state legislators and the senate are basically responsible for picking a president. Its very irrational and old and a big problem. It would just be easier for America to have a popular vote instead of an electoral college.

The electoral college is quite unfair to citizens. They vote for a reason right? To have the person they think best to run the country. Some people might not have as much knowledge about congress or the government or whatever. But still its there right to have a say in what they believe in. some people don't even get to have a say in things. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see ads or even the candidates at all. The senate is not giving people the right to vote for the candidate they want. They say each state only casts one vote. Which is unfair. Many people in one state have their own differences and opinions. For an example, ""the single representative from Wyoming, which represents 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California. Who represent 35 million voters."" ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the houses' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""if the vote is more popular it is not right to change it because the electoral college thinks differently.

Yes in my opinion I think the electoral college is unfair but It's not just that. It is also very outdated. They need to try something new and just let them elect the president over the popular vote. I think it's way less difficult that way. People wouldn't be disputing over the popular vote winner lost, and the electoral college has its defenders to make sure they have their candidate win. it's also irrational. If the just keep on going with this electoral college thing then what's the whole point of the citizens voting?",0,900
"Dear state senator,

There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electoral college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this argument, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electors. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote doesn't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electoral college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electors to represent its population (Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have fewer electors than California). It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more imprecise than popular voting methods. While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple of hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whomever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In' 
The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that ""the Houses' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electoral college votes, as such in the case of Nixon vs Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate loses because of the electoral college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electoral college, didn't get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electoral college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term. And I speak for most of the people in the U.S. when I say, as Bob Dole did: Abolish the electoral college!",0,901
" The overuse of technology has had a significant negative impact on people's lives. Imagine how many accidents occur every week due to the excessive use of technology. For example, Generic_Name was driving while playing his favorite games online and did not pay attention to the red light. The limitations of human contact can lead to many problems in our lives. It is essential to limit our technology use. Technology has had a negative impact on time with families, driving while testing, and energy consumption.

Firstly, families often have limited time to discuss their problems because they spend more time on technology. For instance, Generic_Name was a girl in public high school. She was talking to an old man, but he was looking at her every day, and she did not realize it because he told her he was in another country. As a result, she did not communicate with her family, and she became one of the many young victims of kidnapping. Similarly, people in families use technology inappropriately, leading to less communication and more troubles.

Secondly, some people prefer to communicate via text message while driving. This is a significant cause of accidents, as people often do not even look who is driving next to them. For example, Generic_Name was driving with his mother who was in another country. She came to visit him, but he did not put down his phone and looked at his back, resulting in a car crash crossing a railroad. People often think that using technology and having less communication with their family is safe, but it is not. One distraction from human contact can be deadly.

Thirdly, energy consumption is another problem, as people spend more money on technology. Even though this increase in energy consumption has led to a significant increase in accidents due to the purchase of computers, cellphones, and toys. For example, Generic_Name was addicted to his computer in his room. He was charging it, and as a result, he was friendless and did not communicate with his family as normally.

In conclusion, it is crucial that we limit our technology use to avoid negative consequences. It is not only safe for us and our families but also beneficial for our relationships and energy consumption. It is time for us to make a change and prioritize our relationships and natural resources. The government and the world need to take action to ensure that we are safe and looking around our beautiful natural resources.",1,902
"In the article ''Driverless Cars Are Coming,'' they talk about how there is a new invention coming. As you can tell by the title of the article, they give some pros and cons about the new invention. Some things the author of the article mentions is how the car works and what kind of details will be in it.

One of the first things they mentioned was how the car works. It tells how the car would run on half the fuel we use today. Google has already made a car that is ''driverless' and it has not crashed yet. These cars would run on a track that has an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.

Further on, they also explained some details they might add to the car. One of the details is that the car can handle functions up to twenty-five miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Not all the cars are completely driverless. In fact, the only main things they can do are steer, accelerate, and brake. All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. Another detail they have is that the driver's seat vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into something. One last detail they mention is having cameras watch the driver to make sure that the drivers a remaining focused on the road.

With both of those topics being mentioned, I honestly do not think they should make the cars for public use. They say how it will be safer the driver and those around them, but in all honesty, I do not think they will be. One of the details that does not sound reasonable on the car are the cameras. The idea of someone watching you while you drive just does not sound pleasant. Yes it may make sure the driver is staying focused, but I do not think that should be on there. One of the few things about the car that sounds excellent, is the lower fuel usage. With lower fuel also mean less solution which I think is great.",0,903
"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you because I personally think that Policy 1 definitely is a better policy, there are quite a few explanations to my opinion. Okay, I have always wanted to have our phones out at school but, nobody would ever let us. Now that you give us two policies to think about which one we like better, I choose the one where we can have it out. If I was a teacher I would not let my students have there phones out. I would not tolerate it, because when I am up there teaching I do not want to be up there, so I can see them texting or calling people in my classroom. I am there to be educating my students, so I am reasoning with you there but, they can be turned on because what if there is an emergency, and they don't have the time to turn there phone on? So we need to be able to have our phones on us and turned on at all times. Now places where we could be on our cell phones is in between classes, when you're in the bathroom or walking the halls, and after you finished your work and at lunch. If kids are on their phone in free time, there will be fewer problems, fewer fights, fewer kids arguing because they will be so focused in on their phones. So I really think you should look at the pros and cons and reconsider this cell phone problem.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0,904
"Facial expressions can tell a lot about you, but do you really know what your facial expression is actually showing? Well-being all about the new technology will tell you a lot about your self. Being about the technology will tell you about facial expressions, how the muscles in your face can tell how you really feel, and how the technology works for people. This technology will tell how a person really feels.

Facial expressions can tell a lot about a person and how they might feel. When someone is frowning others may think that your mad or sad. But when someone is smiling others may think that they are happy or excited. Facial expressions can tell a lot about people but none really knows what the true facial expression is. When a person is happy they might simple, when a person is scared they might make a frightened facial expression. Each facial expression means something different."" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."".

Muscles on your face tell what expression a person is using. Someone who is smiling muscles are shaped different from when they are sad or mad. Depending on how you feel is the way your muscles are shaped. ""Your frontal is pars laterals muscle (above our eyes) raises your eyebrows when your surprised; your orbicularis Boris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."", said Dr. Paul Beckman.

You may be wondering how this technology works and what it really does. Well ""this process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."". ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."". "" There are six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, era, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles."" By weighting different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions, meaning that the weight of it can tell. Each one of the expressions that are used are compared to neutral faces.

Imagine if a computer can tell weather your confused or mad or even sad. What if when it could tell what facial expression you was meaning it would change to your interest. This technology could help a lot of people. For an example it could help school kids become more interested in school work if it could tell you was bored and made it more interesting. By showing the students facial expression this technology can better the student just by changing it into something that makes it better for them.",0,905
"As an 8th grader, I am excited to learn about the role of nurses in our society. Through my research, I have discovered that nurses play a vital role in saving people's lives and providing quality healthcare. They are responsible for taking vital signs, administering medication, and providing emotional support to patients and their families. Nurses work in various settings, including hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes, and are an essential part of any healthcare team.

I have also learned about the various responsibilities that nurses have, such as providing post-operative care, managing chronic conditions, and educating patients and their families about healthy habits and disease prevention. Nurses are not only skilled in medical procedures, but they also possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills, which are crucial in building trust and rapport with patients.

In addition to their clinical responsibilities, nurses are also involved in community outreach and volunteer work. Many nurses participate in health fairs, blood drives, and other community events to promote health and wellness. I believe that volunteering in these types of activities can provide valuable experience and exposure to the nursing field, and I am interested in exploring local volunteer opportunities.

One opportunity that has caught my attention is the internship program at the hospital in our area. The hospital has a high reputation in the VA region, and it offers various projects and experiences for interns to gain hands-on experience in the nursing field. As an intern, I would have the opportunity to work alongside experienced nurses and learn from them, which would provide me with valuable insight and skills.

Moreover, interning at the hospital during the summer break would allow me to gain experience and build my resume, which could be beneficial when applying to nursing programs in the future. I believe that this opportunity would provide me with a head start in my nursing career and help me to determine if this is the right path for me.

In conclusion, I am eager to learn more about the role of nurses and explore local volunteer opportunities. I believe that gaining experience through internships and volunteer work can provide valuable exposure and skills, and help me to determine if",1,906
"When have you needed advice for something, and you didn't know what to do, did you go to just one person for advice or multiple people, and how did it affect your outcome? Making the right decision can be really hard, and figuring out what you are going to say or do. It's scary knowing that the choice on what you are going to do might be a huge deal, and it can impact your future. When you also decide what to do you can also regret it after because you felt like it was the wrong choice. So when asking for advice, it can be better asking multiple people because maybe someone had gone through the same experience as you are going through and also maybe someone is going through a similar situation now and maybe helping each other out through this will help each person make a better choice.

Maybe what you are going through now, someone else had gone through it. Maybe what they chose to do in the end was a good or bad decision. They could help you through what you should or shouldn't do on their experiences with that issue. They could teach you stating how it specifically affected them on what they chose to say in the end. Furthermore, they also may tell you what they would have done differently in the end so what they chose would have had a better outcome or if they hadn't changed anything.

When asking someone else for advice, maybe someone is going through the same issue as you. Working together and talking to each other can be a perfect thing, and it can lead to a positive outcome. Looking at the pros and cons can lead to a better result to the both of you too. Seeing what you can do to help each other is a wonderful idea. Just basically making sure you guys are there for each other is a good thing and knowing that you have each other's back.

When asking for advice, it can be better asking multiple people because maybe someone had gone through the same experience as you are going through and also maybe someone is going through a similar situation now and maybe helping each other out through this will help each person make a better choice. Asking someone who had gone through the same experience that you are going through now, can help you because they can tell you what they did and what happened and how they would do things differently. Someone could be going through the same thing as you right now and you guys can talk about what you guys can do. Just making sure that you guys are there for each other can just do good for the both of you. Looking out for each other and having each other's backs can be really comforting to the both of you even if the issue is tiny.",0,907
" Students spend a significant amount of time in school and at home, regardless of their sleeping and leisure activities. While some may argue that more time in school can improve grades, I believe that students need more time to study, rest, and prepare for the next day. Additionally, extending the school day can negatively impact students' extracurricular activities and personal lives, as well as teachers' personal and professional responsibilities.

One of the main reasons why students need more time at home is to study and prepare for exams and assignments. Students have a lot of work to do, and they need enough time to complete it effectively. For example, a student who is a member of a local soccer or basketball team may have to spend several hours practicing and preparing for games or matches. If the school day is extended, the student may have less time to practice and prepare, which can negatively impact their performance on the team. This decision can also affect the teachers, who may have to adjust their schedules to accommodate the extended school day.

Moreover, students have other responsibilities outside of school, such as family obligations, appointments, and chores. If the school day is extended, students may have less time to attend to these responsibilities, which can create stress and anxiety. For example, a teacher who has a child or children may have to pick them up from daycare or school if they don't use the bus. If the school day is extended, the teacher may have to adjust their schedule to accommodate the extended school day, which can be challenging.

In conclusion, while some may argue that extending the school day can improve grades, I believe that students need more time to study, rest, and prepare for the next day. Additionally, extending the school day can negatively impact students' extracurricular activities and personal lives, as well as teachers' personal and professional responsibilities. Therefore, I disagree with the school board's plan to extend the school day and believe that they should focus on providing students with the resources and support they need to succeed academically and personally.",1,908
"Summer projects have always been a sticking point for students and teachers alike. The battle has raged on for years about if summer projects are an effective way for students to learn, or if they are just a waste of time. Most students do not like summer projects at all because they aren't designed for the student specifically. Instead, teacher's design a project that they think will satisfy the most people in a given class, and for that reason my position is that summer projects should be student-designed. This is because it gives more tailored assignments to fit the students wants and needs, it lets them explore something they may be interested in, and it lets students choose their own workload.

Rather than designing a project specifically for one or two people, the teacher's goal is to make a project that is designed to be completed by an entire class. While this is less work for the teacher and students, since they are not creating their own assignment, it has many drawbacks. For one, it is very likely that what the students need and what the teacher thinks they need don't line up. This causes conflict between the two groups, with students coming to hate summer projects because in their mind, it's just another generalized school assignment for them to finish up at the one time they feel they can get proper rest. It also causes conflict between the student's current teacher and their teacher next year. These teachers are very likely not working together to make a summer project, so your teacher next year could completely disregard the project that the other teacher gave, and you would have done all of that work for nothing. If it was a student-designed project however, not only would it be something that the student is actually interested in and wants to work on, it would lessen the workload of the student's teachers, as they have one less thing to worry about in their giant pile of stuff they have to do. On top of that, the project can be fitted to that student's wants and needs, by removing certain sections that they wouldn't be able to remove if it was made by a teacher. They can also add their own spin on the project and do it the way that they want to. Those are just a few examples of how a student-driven project can be adjusted to fit them specifically.

For many teacher-designed summer projects, students are usually given one topic to work on. Students do not have a choice: whether they like it or not, they have to work on that one topic. With a student-designed project, they get the freedom of choosing their own topic. This opens up worlds of possibility for that student, as they can now choose something that interests them, not their teacher. This is very important because many students note a major lack of interest in summer projects, so this could be a way to get students more involved. Of course, this subject has to be in the scope of the class. For example, you can't work on a project about the anatomy of a polar bear in a US History class because that topic has nothing to do with US History. So while students aren't given complete freedom with their topic choices, they get a lot more than if the teacher made the project. That's why its important that students work on something that they're interested in.

Teacher-designed summer projects are designed to be finished in one way only. Usually, there is no room for students to cut a section out or do the project a different way because if they don't follow the teacher's instructions then they could lose points for it. With a student-designed summer project, the workload and structure of the project is chosen by the student, not the teacher. This means that students have more power to change the assignment in a way that they believe they can finish it more effectively and churn out the highest quality project that they feel that they can produce. They also have more power when it comes to revising and editing their projects, as they have no guidelines set by the teacher on what they can and cannot do. For those reasons and more, control over workload is a valuable asset for students that is only had with student-designed projects.

In conclusion, summer projects may always be a sticking point for both students and teachers, but there are ways to improve things on both sides. That was is through student-designed projects. Because they are tailored to the students, are interesting to the students, and allow students control over their workload, they are the far superior way for summer projects to be done. It may not be the perfect solution to an issue like this, but it is far better than teachers deciding what they feel is best for students. Teacher's may think they know what is best for their students, but at the end of the day the students have lived with themselves their whole life, while their teacher has likely known them for less than a year. The student knows themselves inside an out, while the teacher gets a surface view of that student. Something needs to change, and the only people that can make that change are me and my fellow students.",0,909
"The summer project should be Teacher-designed because the teacher knows more about the subject than students do. The main reason why a summer project would be assigned is for students to continue their learning career during break. Most school projects are usually not hard but time-consuming. They really help students to not forget about what they are learning about. In the summer, students tend to take their whole mind off school because there is no work to do, but if they have a project to do, it's easier to keep your mind on the subject you're learning.

If the teacher was the creator of the project, it would be so much more straight forward and exactly on the topic that he or she was going for. The reason why it wouldn't be a good idea for a student to create the project is because it may not be what the teacher wants us to learn, for example, if we are going to read a summer book, and then write a summary on the book; the student can choose a book that: they already read, a very short book, or a book that has nothing to do with the topics they learned about. If the teacher assigned the book, She would let them read and study a book she thinks is best for what they learned over the year.

Another point about why teachers should be the one who designs the projects is because, They have more knowledge about the topic. For example, my history teacher gave us a project to do on World War II, and we had the choice to either create the project ourselves, or for the teacher to design it for us. We had one week to decide either or not we should design it or not, so we made a chart. The outcome of this chart should use that it would be best if the teacher designed it for us. The reasons for letting our teacher design for us was: the teacher is going to be grading it, so we want to know how to do it right, if we were the ones to design the project, and everyone in the class has a different subject, then it would be very confusing on the teacher to grade or talk about in class when we come back in the summer.

The only reason I feel like would be a better idea if the students designed the project is because it gives more creativity for the students. The problem about that is, the student can do the project the way the teacher does not want it to be made. I think the best way to handle this situation is if the teacher gave the students a specific topic and specific rules to the project. In that case the student can be creative but at the same time, the teacher would be able to grade it and talk about it in the class for everyone to listen, because everyone's project would be on the same subject.

In conclusion, the teacher should design the project because, it would give the student a better understanding on the subject that the class is learning about. Students would have a broader thought about what they learned about in that class. They would not forget about what they learned, and they would keep it in mind throughout the whole year. It is honestly hard to remember everything you learned during the year, so summer projects are great for students, if the teacher was the one who designed it.",0,910
"In this writing prompt the topic that is going to be discussed is that if the Idea of technology going to be able to predict what humans are feeling an emotional level.

The Idea of a facial expression reading computer is a good idea but for as long it is used for the right intentions such as using it to read picture of families to know how they are feeling, or using it for a class that is not interested into a subject so the computer alters the lesson to change up the lesson to make more entertaining for the students, but for advertisements that is not very good way to use technology in that way. If the human race is going to use technology like it should be used responsibly and used to help man kind to strive to become better.

The technology for this is remarkable and how we are going this far to use technology like this for only medical purposes, for learning, and to see if someone is lying or telling the truth. If it is going to be used to fill companies pockets full of cash for advertisements it shouldn't be allowed cause taking photos or using technology to invade on peoples privacy just to adjust their own benefits, and I can see it being used for purposes like art work just like the Mona Lisa.

The Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and really what makes it remarkable it tells you all the emotions that they are feeling rather than just one specific emotion. It tells you from the emotion they feel the most to the one they feel the least about.

It is outstanding how technology could come so far in a short amount of time and there is a saying that comes with it comes great power, comes great responsibility and there is technology that is either taken for granted or it is misused for the all the wrong reasons. The FACS or the facial action coding system it could be very useful in for medical research, or it can help detectives to tell them what are witnesses or patients feeling so that they could help them get through their issues in life.",0,911
" The belief that a positive attitude is the key to success in life is a widely held viewpoint. I agree with this perspective, as a positive attitude can have a significant impact on one's personal and professional life. In my experience, having a positive attitude has helped me to achieve my goals, improve my relationships, and be a better person overall.

One of the primary benefits of having a positive attitude is that it can help to improve one's relationships with others. When we approach others with a positive attitude, we are more likely to be understood and appreciated. For example, if someone is upset or angry, a positive attitude can help to defuse the situation by making the other person feel heard and understood. This can lead to a better relationship and a more positive outcome.

Another advantage of having a positive attitude is that it can help to increase productivity and motivation. When we are optimistic about our abilities and the outcomes we can achieve, we are more likely to put in the effort required to succeed. This can lead to better results in our personal and professional lives, as well as a greater sense of satisfaction and fulfillment.

Finally, having a positive attitude can help to improve our overall well-being and happiness. When we focus on the positive aspects of our lives, we are less likely to dwell on negative thoughts and emotions. This can lead to a more positive outlook on life, as well as a greater sense of contentment and joy.

In conclusion, I believe that having a positive attitude is an important factor in achieving success in life. Whether in our personal or professional lives, a positive attitude can help to improve our relationships, increase productivity and motivation, and improve our overall well-being and happiness. By cultivating a positive attitude, we can create a more fulfilling and successful life for ourselves and those around us.",1,912
"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation, and we appreciate what it has done for us. It's a huge part of our election process but is time we move on from it. There have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn't have enough electoral votes. ""It happened in 200, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888"" source 3 This may have not happened more than twice, but this could easily happen again and cause a catastrophe. This is why I disapprove of the electoral college.

This process is also unfair to voters because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The electors can be any citizen, so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an incontinence for the voters. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" source 2.

There has been several of organizations and people who have tried to get the electoral college deleted from election processes including..."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL CIO"" Source 2. These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country, but there are times when things should be left in the past.

Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be solar up to the American people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of an election because one candidate doesn't have enough electoral votes. In my eyes it appears the electoral college has slightly too much impact on the outcome of the election. Imagine running for president and you when the hearts of the voters with popular votes but happen to lose the election because you didn't have enough electoral votes. How would you feel about the electoral college after that experience? This is why there is a need for change in the electoral college. Save candidates from losing an election that they should have one but didn't because they didn't have enough electoral votes.",0,913
"The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration consists of,44 nations that came together to help countries recover their food supplies, animals and more.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people, he got to see other countries, such as Greece, and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily, they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship, and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea, on his second trip Luke served as a watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One time he said he slipped and fell on his backside and his heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship, thankfully a sharp piece of metal stopped his slide, or he would have flown overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive, but he could not work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs.

Luke also found fun on board, especially on return trips.

When the animals had been unloaded, the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing,boxing, reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

" True self-esteem comes from believing in oneself, rather than relying on the opinions of others. As someone once said, ""never let anyone put you down, always get right back up on your feet."" This means that individuals should have confidence in their abilities and not let the opinions of others bring them down.

The first step to building self-esteem is to be confident in one's abilities. For example, when I was preparing for a test, my teacher praised me for my hard work and encouraged me to stay positive. When the test day arrived, I was confident in my abilities and was able to pass with flying colors. This experience showed me that when someone believes in you, you are more likely to believe in yourself.

Another important aspect of building self-esteem is having the courage to overcome fears and challenges. For example, when I was running a relay race, I started to fall behind and felt like giving up. However, my teammates cheered me on and encouraged me to keep going. With their support, I was able to overcome my fear and cross the finish line. This experience showed me that courage can be a powerful tool in building self-esteem.

Finally, it is important for young people to trust the advice of adults and not dismiss it outright. For example, when I was younger, I would often ignore my mother's warnings about hanging out with certain friends. However, when I got caught stealing from a store, I realized that my mother had been right all along. This experience taught me that listening to the wisdom of others can be a valuable tool in building self-esteem.

In conclusion, praising oneself and having confidence in one's abilities is essential for building self-esteem. By being confident, courageous, and trusting in the advice of others, individuals can overcome challenges and achieve their goals. As the saying goes, ""never let anyone put you down, always get right back up on your feet.""",1,915
"I think these projects should be students designs instead of teacher designed. The students designs can influence each other, help one another, and the teachers don't have to come up with the projects for the students.

To begin with, having students to design the summer projects can have a good effect on the students. The students can influence other students to come up with ideas for the summer project. For example, they can help to organize something for their community as a summer project. Doing a summer project can get the students to do more for everybody that's around them. Also, they can be able to work together as a team.

Next, they can help one another out. The students can come together to work to help each other out. Helping the other students is good for the teacher to see on how well the students can work doing a summer project. The students can help come up with different ideas if they get stuck on something and need help. Helping each other out is that they can communicate with one another so that they can be able to work together and comfortable around other students.

Finally, the teachers don't have to come up with project for the students to do. It would be less for for them because they would have explained what they need to for the project. It will be easier for the teachers to be organized with keeping the projects from being all over the place. For example, they also can be graded fattest. Teacher doesn't have o as hard as they need to if the students design their own projects.

In conclusion, I believe that the projects should be student designed. It can help the students if they get stuck with the projects. They can work together to improve their teamwork skills.",0,916
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think if a student has a c average you should give him or a chance. It would be UN fair cause if a student did his or her best and all they could give is a c then you should let them play. A lot of students aren't able to pull of a b average so give those students a chance to play sports. So will you change that policy for all the students that pull of a b average cause a c average isn't that bad they are still passing, but they can play sports and anything else they want.

This is how I feel about your policy, there are so many students that only have sports some people that don't have sports they end up doing nothing. People drop out of school because they think if they don't have the grades to play sports they can't do anything with their life.

" What is one type of job you would like to employ, and why would you employ it? The one job I would employ would be a doctor. The one type of work I would employ would be a doctor because it has a lot of money and I want to help people.

Generic\_Name wanted to be a doctor, but his parents didn't want him to be a doctor because they knew that doctors didn't have a lot of money. Generic\_Name also wanted to become rich, so he could help his family. But Generic\_Name dreamed so little for himself.

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and an advocate for the democratic process, I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College for the election of the President of the United States. While some may argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital and fair representation of our diverse nation, ensuring that every region has a voice in the presidential election.

One of the primary benefits of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of a presidential election. Unlike a popular vote system, where disputes over the results can occur, the Electoral College allows for a clear winner to emerge. As Judge Richard A. Poster points out in ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This structure provides stability and prevents prolonged disputes over election outcomes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes national unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. With the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, no single region can dominate the election process. As Judge Poster suggests, this ensures that the president has broader support and is not merely a representative of one particular region. It encourages candidates to campaign in all areas of the country, ensuring that they understand and address the diverse needs of different regions.

In addition, the Electoral College helps to highlight the significance of swing states. These states, where the outcome is often uncertain, receive more attention from candidates and campaigns. By focusing on these states, candidates are forced to engage with voters and address their concerns, leading to a more informed electorate. This method allows for the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from candidates, to influence the final outcome, as pointed out by Judge Poster.

The Electoral College also ensures that large states have their fair share of attention from candidates. As Judge Poster argues, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution reduces the weight of large states. However, with the Electoral College, large states like Florida can still command significant attention from presidential candidates. This balance between large and small states is crucial in maintaining fairness and representation in our election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College system eliminates the need for run-off elections. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, it guarantees that a clear winner emerges. This avoids the complications and expenses associated with run-off elections, allowing for a more streamlined election process.

While some may argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is the most effective and fair method for electing the President. It ensures stability, balances regional interests, highlights swing states, provides attention to large states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Abolishing the Electoral College, as argued by Bradford Plume in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" may lead to a concentrated focus on highly populated areas, while neglecting the needs and concerns of other areas of the country.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the significant benefits of the Electoral College and to support its continuation. The Electoral College serves as a crucial safeguard to protect the representation and voices of all regions in our great nation. By maintaining this system, we can uphold the democratic principles upon which our country was built.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider my views and make the best decision for our nation.

Sincerely,

"After School Homework Club: A Pathway to Enhanced Student Achievement

Introduction

As an eighth-grade student, I have observed that many students struggle with completing their homework assignments. This is not only a problem for individual students but also for the school as a whole. To address this issue, I propose the establishment of an after school homework club that would provide a supportive and structured environment for students to work on their assignments. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of starting an after school homework club, provide suggestions for its implementation, and address potential challenges that may arise.

Benefits of an After School Homework Club

1. Improved Academic Performance: By providing a dedicated space for students to work on their homework assignments, the after school homework club can help improve their academic performance. This is because students will have access to resources, guidance, and support from their peers and teachers.
2. Time Management: Many students struggle with managing their time effectively, leading to procrastination and poor academic performance. The after school homework club can help students develop time management skills by providing a structured environment for completing homework assignments.
3. Socialization: Homework can be a tedious and solitary task, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their peers. The after school homework club can provide an opportunity for students to socialize and collaborate with their peers, making the homework process more enjoyable and engaging.

Suggestions for Implementing an After School Homework Club

1. Teacher Involvement: Teachers play a crucial role in the success of the after school homework club. They should be involved in the planning and implementation of the club, as well as providing guidance and support to students.
2. Resource Allocation: The after school homework club should have access to resources such as computers, textbooks, and study materials. These resources can be provided by the school or donated by parents and community members.
3. Time Management: The after school homework club should have a set schedule for completing homework assignments. This can help students develop time management skills and ensure that they are making progress on their assignments.
4. Peer Tutoring: The after school homework club can provide an opportunity for peer tutoring, where students can help each other with their assignments. This can be facilitated by teachers or by having students take turns leading study sessions.

The travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0,922
"How do you get to where you need to go? Do you take a bus, drive a vehicle, ride a bicycle or walk? In 2005 in the United States, almost everybody had a personal vehicle for transportation needs. People all around the world are working to break the habit of using a motorized vehicle to get places. Scientists say that driving the vehicle has a very bad effect on the environment.

In Vauban, Germany people are suburban pioneers. They have forbidden street parking, driveways and home garages. Their streets are car free, with some few exceptions. They have allowed car ownership, but there are only two places to park. They have large garages at the edge of the development, where the car owner has to buy a space that costs $40,000, along with a home. As a result of these limitations, 70% of people do not own cars, and 57% sold their car to move here. Hadron Walter, a mother of two says that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Vauban is a growing trend in Europe, that was completed in 2006. Experts say that it is a huge effort to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

In Paris, they have enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday's motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their vehicle at home or suffer a $31 fine. On Tuesdays, the odd numbered license plates would follow the same regulations. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after the intensifying smog. Smog is a big problem in France, and it even rivaled China's most polluted cities in the world. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.

In Bogotá, Colombia there was a program that is set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day. Businessman Carlos Arturo Place says that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Authorities from other countries came to witness this event and were enthusiastic and believes they are generating a revolutionary change, and it is crossing borders. Parks and sport centers have bloomed throughout the city. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks and the rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In America, President Obama has ambitious goals to curb the greenhouse gas emissions and has gained a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior. America had long been one of the world's prime car cultures, where it was the birthplace of the Model T. It seems that America's love affair for its vehicles is cooling. The miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has been on a steady decrease since then. Sociologists believe that if this pattern continues it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, right behind the power plants. Many people are taking advantage of carpooling apps, the internet is helping keep people connected so that they don't have to drive somewhere just to talk to someone. There has been a large drop in percentage of 16 years olds to 39-year-olds getting a license. A study last year found that driving by young people has decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company has laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve power, lower emissions and improve safety.

Do you think you will still take a motorized vehicle to get to wherever you are going after reading this article? If not, you could be one of the many people that would contribute to saving the Earth and it's precious environments. We are going through a revolution of environmental friendly transportation, are you going to be a part of this?",0,923
"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Do you agree or disagree with this decision? Use specific details and examples to convince others support your position.

I agree because students who do not like to do sports or anything at all its good for them to do something to keep them busy and occupied. And someone should at least convince them to try something new in sports.

When I was younger my mom always told me that I should play basketball. Because I wasn't doing an after school sport at all and i didn't like sports at the time. So we talked about doing it and I tried it i kind of liked it is was fun because of the basketball drills and got to meet new friends on the team. After that I started doing flag football, and tackle football and I enjoyed it and I was always busy and occupied.

I think students who don't do any sports should try it. Because it will keep you busy, and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and it's very competitive. Other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you want to do in the future if you really like sports and good at it. It would also make your family proud of you because of all the hard work you did to get this opportunity. But it also takes time to be good at something only if you try. Because that's the only way to get somewhere.",0,924
"Wouldn't you like to take a break from having to drive all time? Well maybe now you can because the driverless car period is in the near future. Though the car wouldn't be completely driverless, it'd still give you a small break from having to do all the driving. Safety is away the number one priority, and a smart car will deliver that. There are plenty of benefits in the making of a smart car.

Think about all the sensors that would need to go into a smart car. Doesn't that make you feel safer just thinking about having sensors that detect and tell you when you're in danger? So far, a smart car can only steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Also, they're all designed to notify the driver when there is a work zone or an accident ahead, so the driver can know to take control. GM has seats that vibrate when the car is in danger of being backed into an object. There are other options of danger warnings being considered as well. Such as, flashing lights on a windshield and other heads up displays.

Yes, a smart car is not yet completely driverless. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have plans to have cars drive on their own by 2020. Smart cars would fundamentally change the world. According to the article, Google cofounder Sergey Brin ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system"" that would use half the gas of today's taxis and also offer way more flexibility than a bus.

Of course, we run into the argument of why would anyone buy a driverless car that would still partially require a driver. And the question of: wouldn't it get boring waiting until they need to drive? Sure, but think about not having to drive 100% of the time in a fun, new way. Some manufacturers are even hoping to have in-car entertainment and information systems. Those systems would use heads-up displays that could be instantly turned off when the driver needs to take control.

In conclusion, think about all the benefits of a smart car. At the same time though, think about the downfalls. A smart car would be safe and fun for you and your family. Some would argue otherwise, that a smart car is just as dangerous, and it'd get boring. Finally, these cars are our future because there are car manufacturers that already have plans in motion.",0,925
"I was once asked to write a letter about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote. My Opinion is that they need to change Electoral College. The three reasons why they should keep it is because, it's not fair, it doesn't waste a lot of time, the electoral votes given to each state.

To Begin with, Electoral Voting seems very easy. Electoral College consists of 538 electors. They need a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the president. But there a lot of things wrong with the electoral college too. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election. And voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who select the president. The Electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system, the candidates don't spend much time in the states they know they don't have a chance of winning. This is one of the reasons why they should change Electoral college.

To Briefly Continue, The Electoral College isn't a good system to use in my opinion. But the System doesn't waste a lot of time. This is probably the only reason they still use it today. All they do is go state by state seeing the candidates group of electors votes. This process takes about 3 to 4 Hours to see what candidate won to be the President of the United States Of America. The President election is held every 4 years, on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. But this is another reason why the Electoral college system needs to be changed to popular vote.

Last But Not Least, The electoral votes given to each state sucks. Its not fair Texas gets 38 electoral but New York only gets 3. Way more people live in New York Than Texas. If they used election by popular vote everyone has the choice to pick which candidate they want to be president. And The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism. It's hard for a democratic to win it. The Electors that elect for president not the people. This is another why this needs to be change.

To briefly conclude, the system needs to be changed. it's not fair to have and electoral voting system. The people don't get to vote for the candidate they want to win. These are some reasons why the system needs to be changed.  ",0,926
"Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to you as a constituent and active participant in our democracy to share my perspective on a matter of national concern: the continuance or dissolution of the Electoral College. The founders of our nation crafted the Electoral College as a compromise to ensure both direct individual contribution and representation at a state level (Paragraph 1, Text 1). Nonetheless, its relevance and efficacy have become subjects of intense debate, and I believe it is crucial that we preserve this system.

One predominant argument against the Electoral College is that it is not in line with the tenets of a direct democracy (Paragraph 14, Text 2). While this critique holds some truth, the function of the Electoral College extends beyond simple vote counting. It stratifies attention based on state engagements, forcing presidential candidates to appeal across regional lines (Paragraph 19, Text 3). A candidate with a broad trans-regional appeal is more likely to effectively serve the entire country as their policies must be inclusive of various regions, making the election process more democratic in a comprehensive sense.

The current system has been criticized for allowing a presidential candidate to lose the popular vote but win the presidency via electoral votes, as occurred in the 2000 election (Paragraph 9, Text 2). This scenario, though striking, is rare, and the Electoral College, in contrast, often lends clarity to electoral outcomes (Paragraph 18, Text 3). The ""winner-takes-all"" method, usually resulting in landslide victories within states and a more definitive outcome, reduces the likelihood of contested results.

Critics also argue that the Electoral College encourages candidates to strategically target ""swing states"", leaving certain areas inadequately represented (Paragraph 13, Text 2). However, all voters are equal stakeholders in our democracy, and their votes matter in shaping the final tally. Moreover, focusing on ""swing states"" encourages political engagement and thoughtful voting (Paragraph 20, Text 3).

Additionally, the Electoral College rectifies the political imbalance that large states suffer due to the Senate's mal-apportionment, ensuring they receive due attention from presidential candidates (Paragraph 21, Text 3). Finally, the Electoral College simplifies the electoral process, all but eliminating the need for run-off elections in instances where no candidate achieves the voting majority, providing a clear winner in each election cycle (Paragraph 22, Text 3).

While it is extremely important to voice criticisms of our electoral processes, it is equally crucial to understand the practical usefulness of the existing structures. Therefore, in light of the rationales listed above, I express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. I am confident that you will consider all perspectives in this discussion when forming your stance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

"As we navigate through life, we are constantly learning and expanding our knowledge. It is essential that we continue to acquire new facts and information in our academic or professional fields in order to grow and succeed. However, it is equally important to recognize the limits of our knowledge and understanding. In this essay, I will argue that acknowledging the limits of our knowledge is essential, and I will provide several reasons and examples to support this claim.

First, acknowledging the limits of our knowledge helps us avoid overconfidence and arrogance. It is easy to become overconfident in our abilities when we acquire new knowledge and skills. This can lead to a lack of humility and a reluctance to seek out further information or perspectives. Overconfidence can also result in making errors or taking unnecessary risks. For example, a doctor who fails to acknowledge the limits of their medical knowledge may be more likely to misdiagnose a patient or prescribe a treatment that is not effective. On the other hand, a doctor who acknowledges the limits of their knowledge is more likely to seek out other opinions and information to ensure the best care for their patient.

Second, recognizing the limits of our knowledge allows us to be open to learning from others. No matter how much we know or how experienced we are, there is always more to learn from others. Being open to new perspectives and ideas can help us expand our understanding and gain new insights. For example, a marketing professional who acknowledges the limits of their knowledge may seek out the opinions of colleagues who have different specialties or experiences. This can lead to a more comprehensive and effective marketing strategy.

Third, acknowledging the limits of our knowledge can lead to greater collaboration and teamwork. When we recognize that we do not have all the answers or expertise, we are more likely to collaborate with others who have complementary skills and knowledge. This can lead to more innovative and effective solutions to complex problems. For example, in scientific research, collaboration between researchers with different areas of expertise often results in breakthrough discoveries that would not have been possible otherwise.

Finally, recognizing the limits of our knowledge can foster a sense of curiosity and a desire to continue learning. When we acknowledge that there is always more to learn, we are more likely to seek out new information and experiences. This can lead to personal and professional growth, as well as a greater appreciation for the world around us. For example, a historian who acknowledges the limits of their knowledge may be more curious about the social and cultural context of the events they are studying. This can lead to a deeper understanding of historical events and their impact on society.

In conclusion, while it is important to acquire new knowledge and skills in our academic or professional fields, it is equally important to recognize the limits of our knowledge and understanding. Acknowledging these limits can help us avoid overconfidence, be open to learning from others, collaborate effectively, and foster curiosity and a desire to continue learning. By recognizing the limits of our knowledge, we can become more effective and successful in our chosen fields.

"As a society, we have become increasingly reliant on cars. They provide us with a convenient way to get around, but they also have a number of negative consequences. In this essay, I will argue that limiting car usage is beneficial for a variety of reasons.

First, cars contribute to air pollution. According to the EPA, transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.  Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer.  Limiting car usage would help to reduce air pollution and improve public health.

Second, cars are a major source of traffic congestion. Congestion wastes time, fuel, and money. In the United States, drivers spend an average of 38 hours per year in traffic. Congestion also leads to accidents, which can cause injuries and fatalities.  Limiting car usage would help to reduce traffic congestion and improve mobility.

Third, cars take up a lot of space. Parking lots and highways consume valuable land that could be used for other purposes, such as parks, schools, or housing.  Limiting car usage would free up space and allow communities to become more livable.

Of course, there are some challenges to limiting car usage. For example, cars are often necessary for getting to work or school. However, there are a number of ways to reduce our reliance on cars, such as walking, biking, taking public transportation, or carpooling.

In conclusion, there are a number of benefits to limiting car usage. It can help to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and the amount of space cars take up. It can also improve public health and make communities more livable.  By making some changes to our lifestyles, we can all help to create a more sustainable future.

"## The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have become an essential part of our lives. We use them to get to work, school, and the grocery store. We use them to go on vacation and visit friends and family. But cars also have a significant impact on our environment and our health.

One of the biggest problems with cars is that they produce a lot of pollution. When cars burn gasoline, they release carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and other pollutants into the air. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. They can also contribute to climate change.

Cars also contribute to traffic congestion. When too many cars are on the road, it can lead to delays and frustration. Traffic congestion can also waste time and money. It can also contribute to air pollution and noise pollution.

In addition to the environmental and health impacts, cars also have a financial impact. Cars are expensive to buy, fuel, and maintain. They also require parking, which can be expensive in urban areas. The cost of car ownership can be a burden for many people, especially those with low incomes.

There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to walk or bike instead of driving. Walking and biking are good for our health, and they don't produce any pollution. Another way to limit car usage is to take public transportation. Public transportation is a good alternative to driving, especially in urban areas. It's also a more affordable option for many people.

We can also limit car usage by working from home. Working from home can save us time and money, and it can also help to reduce traffic congestion. We can also carpool or take ride-sharing services. These options can help to reduce the number of cars on the road.

Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and save money. It can also be a good way to get exercise and connect with our community. There are a number of ways to limit car usage, and we should all consider doing our part to reduce our reliance on cars.

In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. Cars have a significant impact on our environment and our health, and they can also be expensive. There are a number of ways to limit car usage, and we should all consider doing our part to reduce our reliance on cars.",1,931

"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that teenagers should participate in extracurricular activities. Not only do extracurricular activities provide numerous benefits for personal growth and development, but they also help teenagers build important skills that will serve them well in the future.

First and foremost, participating in an extracurricular activity allows teenagers to explore their interests and passions. Whether it's playing a sport, joining a club, or volunteering, teenagers can find activities that they truly enjoy and are committed to. This not only helps them to develop a sense of purpose and fulfillment, but it also allows them to pursue their interests outside the classroom.

In addition to allowing teenagers to explore their interests, extracurricular activities also provide opportunities for personal growth and development. For example, playing a sport requires discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. Joining a club or volunteer organization allows teenagers to develop leadership skills, communication skills, and a sense of community. These skills are not only important for success in school and work, but they are also essential for building strong relationships and making a positive impact in the world.

Furthermore, participating in an extracurricular activity can also improve a teenager's academic performance. Research has shown that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have higher grades and test scores than those who do not. This is because extracurricular activities often require time management, organization, and dedication, which are all important skills for academic success.

Personally, I have seen the benefits of extracurricular activities firsthand. When I was in high school, I joined the debate team, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Not only did I learn valuable communication and critical thinking skills, but I also made lifelong friends and gained a sense of confidence and self-assurance.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that teenagers should participate in extracurricular activities. Not only do they provide opportunities for personal growth and development, but they also help teenagers build important skills that will serve them well in the future. Whether it's playing a sport, joining a club, or volunteering, there is an extracurricular activity out there for everyone. So, I encourage all teenagers to take advantage of",1,933
"The Google cofounder Sergey Brin thinks that the genius idea of driverless cars will be around by the year of 2020. This would mean there would be fewer accidents if it is put out into the world when it's working properly.

Driverless cars would cause fewer wrecks and be safer to pedestrians. If you were drinking you could put the driverless part of the car on, so there wouldn't be a problem getting you home. Many accidents are caused by people that are tired, drunk, or under the influence of something. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This quote shows that alert drivers would be the best for our safety, but the drivers not alert or under the influence of something could cause serious damage to someone or something which is why the car should have a setting for the human to drive and one setting for the car to drive.

Driverless cars is a great idea and have some flaws at the moment buy in a couple of years it will run perfectly or close to perfect, so it can keep people safe. This would cause less accidents in car related things.",0,934
"
The development of driverless cars is a topic that has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. While some people see it as a revolutionary innovation that will change the way we travel, others are skeptical about its safety and practicality. In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the development of driverless cars, using details from the article to support my position.

One of the main advantages of driverless cars is their potential to reduce the number of accidents on the road. According to the article, driverless cars are programmed to follow traffic laws and avoid reckless behavior, which means that they can significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. This is a significant benefit, as accidents caused by human error are a leading cause of death and injury on the road. Additionally, driverless cars are equipped with advanced sensors and cameras that allow them to detect potential hazards and react faster than human drivers. This means that they can avoid accidents that human drivers might not be able to avoid.

Another benefit of driverless cars is their potential to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. The article states that driverless cars can travel closer together than human-driven cars, which means that they can fit more cars on the road, reducing traffic congestion and improving travel times. This is especially important in cities, where traffic congestion is a major problem that can lead to frustration, wasted time, and lost productivity.

Furthermore, driverless cars have the potential to improve mobility for people who are unable to drive. According to the article, driverless cars can provide independence for people who are elderly, disabled, or visually impaired, allowing them to travel without the need for a human driver. This can greatly improve their quality of life and increase their independence.

However, there are also some concerns about the safety and reliability of driverless cars. Some people are worried that the technology might not be reliable, and that driverless cars might cause accidents or malfunction. While these concerns are valid, I believe that they can be addressed through rigorous testing and regulation. The article states that many companies are already testing driverless cars, and that government regulations are being put in place to ensure their safety.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a promising innovation that has the potential to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and improve mobility for people who are unable to drive. While there are some concerns about their safety and reliability, I believe that these can be addressed through rigorous testing and regulation. Overall, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the drawbacks, and I am in favor of their development.",1,935
"Some schools give out the option of attending classes from home. Instead of going to school, students learn their subjects online or through video conferencing. Even though this method of learning is not as popular, it is more effective for students. I know students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home.

First, being at home is better than being in a stuffy learning facility. Multiple studies have proven that students learn better when given time outside away from the iridescent lights and circulated air. When students are crammed in a building with different people for hours, it tends to get harder to focus from distractions, some people get tense, and others might get antsy from boredom or anxiety. When at home, you do not have to be with multiple people in a boxy building, sitting, for hours; you can go outside and breathe fresh air if you want. You can choose where you want to do your work as long as there is internet access around, like in your bedroom. Being at home is all around more comfortable and when people are comfortable, they tend to excel better at what they are doing.

Second, in a school there are hundreds, and in some cases maybe even thousands, of people you may not know; there are regulations that some may find annoying and restricting, but when at home, you are most likely in a space that you know and feel comfortable in. You are around familiar faces that do not intimidate you, so the chances of peer pressure are slim. You do not have to be afraid of wearing headphones or failing because of the stress teachers give when expecting students to finish stacks of work in one class sitting. Instead, you can wear whatever you want and classes are most likely on a schedule that work for you. Since you are at ease, it is easier to focus on what needs to get done and succeed at the curriculum.

Some may say, that people who attend classes from home, will slack off and not learn anything. This is because there are not as many authoritative figures around to execute and remind these students of what is to be done. However, the students who do their schooling online are in a better and comfortable learning environment. Therefore, making it easier to learn and complete the necessary assignments vital to their subjects.

In conclusion, attending classes online is given by some schools and includes online work or video conferences. The online schooling is more supplemental toward students and their learning because they do not have to deal with detrimental factors that can slow down learning such as: peer pressure, strangers, unknown or uncomfortable learning environments, stressful teachers, or strict rules. Online schooling is an all around better learning environment and will benefit students. All schools should give out the option of attending classes online.  ",0,936
"Electoral College method should not be kept because it gives larger states a bigger advantage and is unfair to voters. Even though it can be argued that the Electoral College method should be kept due to avoiding problems of a run-off in an election.

The Electoral College consists of electoral votes that each states receives due to the population of the state. This gives larger states like California having 55 electoral votes to have a bigger say in the election. Meanwhile, states with a less population rate like Alaska only have 3 electoral votes. This turns off voters because they know that their state isn't a big deal in an election. Candidates go for the electoral votes of the bigger states with the most population to win the election.

The Electoral College is a method that is unfair to voters. The winner take all system in each state's makes candidates or even voters not want to spend their time on current states they know will not have an impact in the election. It ends up being the electors who elect the president, and not the people. The Electoral College method is not democratic in that perspective.

The Electoral College is a lack of democratic pedigree and unfair to voters, it is impacting votes due to electoral votes being in power over the people. Due to the Electoral College method turning off voters it should not be kept.",0,937
"While the Facial Action Coding System technology described in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" could potentially provide some benefits if used to read student emotions in the classroom, there are also significant risks and ethical concerns that need to be considered. 

One potential benefit is that teachers may be able to gain insights into how effectively their lessons are being delivered by monitoring student expressions in real-time. If many students appear bored or confused, the teacher could adjust their approach. This could help improve teaching methods. Additionally, signs of negative emotions like stress or anxiety may help identify students who need extra support. On the surface, this type of monitoring seems aimed at helping students.

However, there are also several issues with this approach. Firstly, student emotions are complex and identifying them based solely on facial expressions could lead to incorrect interpretations. More subtle emotions may not be detected accurately. Secondly, constant monitoring of expressions may make students feel uncomfortable or lack autonomy over their emotional responses. They may censor their natural reactions if aware their faces are being analyzed. This could have unintended mental health consequences over time. 

Perhaps most importantly, without student consent this type of surveillance could be considered a violation of privacy. Classrooms are intended to be safe learning spaces, not laboratories for emotional experimentation. Even with consent, there are questions around how the data would be stored, shared, and possibly used against students in the future. Overall individual student privacy should take precedence over potential teaching benefits when such invasive technologies are involved.

In conclusion, while the goal of helping students through emotional insights is reasonable, the risks to student well-being and privacy posed by this surveillance technology outweigh any educational value it could provide in a classroom setting. More research and oversight would be needed to address ethical concerns before such systems could be considered appropriate. On balance, their use does not seem justified or advisable given less invasive alternative means exist to gain student feedback and identify needs. Student consent, well-being and privacy should be top priorities in educational decisions.",1,938
"Many people think or believe that they should get rid of the Electoral College vote for the president. Well in my opinion I believe they should not keep it because why do we even need them for? We have the people of the US. They can vote for a president, that's why the Constitution was written, to gives us the rights, freedom of speech, the right to vote. Why else would we have that if our vote won't really matter.

They should get rid of the Electoral College Vote because we already have many people voting for the president. We don't really need many people just to choose one man or woman to lead the country. They can just count how many citizens voted for a president and the one who has more voters is the winner. If it ends up as a tie, then just let the members of the House of Representatives vote. Or at least let the popular vote decide who the president will be.

Having the Electoral College vote is useless, because they just vote for a slate of electors, who in turn will elect the president. It just adds more steps to elect the president. They should just get rid of it and keep the popular vote for the President of the United States. Let the qualified citizens vote who they want to be the president. It'd make more sense, because they just vote for someone who is not holding office, anyone. I say get rid of it so that we don't get a ""disaster factor"" anymore. That 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century.  This electoral college vote is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Its unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

However, many people may disagree. They believe that we should keep the electoral college vote. There are five reasons of why they think we should keep this type of method of choosing the President. The first reason is the certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely to happen than a dispute over the popular vote. The second reason is everyone's president. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal and no region has enough electoral votes to elect for a president.  The third reason is the swing states. The unfair method of winner-takes-all electoral votes induces the candidates and focuses on the voters in toss-up states whom more likely pay close attention to the campaign. The fourth reason is the big states. Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance by letting a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. And the fifth reason is to avoid run-off elections. It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

So in conclusion they should get rid of the electoral college vote because it's unfair to the small states. Knowing that their vote will not have any effect, they have no reason to pay attention to the campaign. They can just let the popular vote decide or the House of Representatives. Bob Dole was right. Let's get rid of the electoral college vote. Mostly get rid of it because it's unfair to some states or people. Its is really an irrational way to settle on an agreement of whom the president may be. And yes is may have fewer disputes over the outcome but it better to have some disputes over it, so we elect the correct president and see what all their qualities may be. In my opinion I believe we should abolish the electoral college.",0,939
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it would be highly beneficial for students to have a longer summer break, a one-week break in the spring and fall, and a shorter winter break. This would allow students to spend more time with family, travel, and have fun during the break times.

During the summer break, students can take advantage of the extra time to spend with family and friends. This is a time when families can plan trips, vacations, and other activities together. It is also a time when students can catch up on any missed time with their friends and catch up on their hobbies and interests.

In the spring and fall, students can have a one-week break to recharge and relax before the final stretch of the school year. This break can be used to catch up on any missed time with family and friends, or to explore new places. It is also a time when students can take advantage of the changing seasons to try new activities such as hiking, skiing, or snowboarding.

The shorter winter break is a time when students can catch up on any missed time with family and friends, or to take advantage of the winter holidays to spend time with loved ones. It is also a time when students can take advantage of winter to try new activities such as ice skating, snowboarding, or skiing.

Personally, I have experienced the benefits of having longer breaks during the school year. During the summer break, my family and I took a trip to Hawaii, where we spent time exploring the beautiful beaches and trying new activities such as surfing and snorkeling. During the spring break, my friends and I took a trip to the mountains, where we went hiking and explored the beautiful scenery. During the winter break, my family and I spent time together playing board games and watching movies.

In conclusion, I believe that it would be highly beneficial for students to have a longer summer break, a one-week break in the spring and fall, and a shorter winter break. This would allow students to spend more time with family, travel, and have fun during the break times. By having these breaks, students can recharge and return to school ready to learn and grow.",1,940
"Dear state senator,

There has been some controversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful (there have been a few times problems have occurred, but rarely it happens). As time has passed, and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work, and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote. However, even though there have been a few problems in the past about this system, the Electoral College is still the best method of voting.

It is hard to argue that there are some problems with the Electoral College. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Bradford Plume). The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. ""The Electoral College method is not Democratic in a modern sense."" (Richard A Poster). The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (Bradford Plume). The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want (and it has happened a few times in the past). ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" (Bradford Plume). That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.""(Bradford Plume). The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All in all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time.

However, despite the worries and concerns that some people may have, the Electoral College is still the best method for voting. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote."" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"".(Richard A. Poster). This system also can often prevent disputes. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote."" (Richard A. Poster). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal... This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Poster). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. ""Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign."" (Richard A. Poster). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. ""The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" (Richard A. Poster). And lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid run-off elections. ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" (Richard A. Poster). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.

All in all, the Electoral College is the best way for voting. With this system, there are many benefits to the election process that people may not realize. With benefits like it avoids run-off elections, and it makes the voters more aware, some people still believe that a popular vote is still the best way. It is important to remember that there is a reason that we have certain methods, to benefit our country. And that is what the Electoral College is, a benefit to our country. So senator, and based on the evidence given, it is important to keep the Electoral College for all the benefits it brings and for the sake of our great nation that we live in.",0,941
" Dear : Principal

I believe that allowing students to participate in community service would have a positive impact on the school and the community. By engaging in community service, students can not only contribute to the cleanliness of the streets but also develop a sense of empathy and compassion towards others. While it is understandable that some people may not enjoy cleaning, I believe that by starting small and encouraging students to help in a variety of ways, such as painting the sidewalk, cleaning the beaches, or helping those in need, we can begin to change the behavior of others and make a positive impact on the community.

While it may not be feasible to require students to participate in community service every day, I believe that setting aside a few hours each week for service would be a good start. This would allow students to continue with their studies while also giving them the opportunity to give back to the community. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial for the school to partner with local organizations to provide students with opportunities to help those in need, such as the elderly, disabled, or veterans.

Overall, I believe that allowing students to participate in community service would be a valuable addition to the school curriculum. Not only would it benefit the community, but it would also help students develop important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and empathy. I hope that you will consider this proposal and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.",1,942
"We, the people of the United States, live in a car happy society. Every teenager can't wait until their 16th birthday because, for almost every kid, that means that they go get their driver's license and possibly their very own car. Also, adults always look at getting a nice luxurious car and the top make and model of that year. Well, without a shadow of doubt, we should adopt the plan to cut down our usage of cars. It seems very successful considering 70% of Vaughn's families don't own cars. It is detrimental to our country.

In case you haven't noticed lately, but there is a lot of pollution in the air.

According to article 1, anywhere up to 50 percent of car intensive areas in the US make up the greenhouse gas emissions. It is depressing seeing all of this smog and pollution in the air every day. Just a little heads up, but the pollution increases every single day we use cars. It is a shame seeing such an extravagant and extraordinary country go to crap due to pollution. If you want to see how every state is going to look if we keep relying on cars then go to California and see how much of an eyesore it is. Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and pollution. Solution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care lot about making and having the lot of Benjamin. Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all the things you wouldn't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even carpool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen every day and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is terrifying and nerve racking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple of years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the ruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would have been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question, it is necessary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our pollution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little and see what the result is. At least once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well-thought-out, and it will definitely show improvements that we want to see. So let's do it and see how much it affects our country.",0,943
"Dear senator,

I have done research and would like to change the Electoral College to the popular vote for the President of the United States. Source 1: ""What is electoral College?"" explains that ""each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" Many people do not know what that really means. It means that the people of the United States do not actually vote for who their president will be. They are voting for someone who gets to choose who the president will be. Having the Electoral College is very confusing. I think it is more fair to have the people of the United States vote directly for their president instead of voting for a slate of election that than choose the president.

By getting rid of the Electoral College, the vote for the United States president will be more fair. We, the people of the United States, would not be voting for a slate of electors. We would actually be voting for whom we want to become our president. These votes would be more direct and accurate.

Source 2: ""Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states that voters may get confused and vote for someone that they didn't want to vote for. The people should be the ones voting for their president. It is unfair that only the electors get to vote in the end. Voters of the electors cannot even control who the electors vote for. The people have to put their trust in the electors to vote for the president. It makes smore sense for the people to have a say and for them to have the ability to vote directly.

When I turn eighteen, and I am allowed to vote, I hope that my vote actually matters. I hope that my vote does not just go towards an elector. I hope that my vote will count towards whom I think will represent our country well.  ",0,944
" Car usage is a major contributor to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic congestion. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards limiting car usage as a way to address these issues. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage and provide evidence from multiple sources to support this claim.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of pollution, accounting for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and reduce our impact on the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Cars are a major cause of traffic congestion, which can lead to longer commute times, increased stress levels, and decreased productivity. By limiting the number of cars on the road, we can reduce congestion and improve the flow of traffic.

In addition to these environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. Car ownership and maintenance can be expensive, and by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce the cost of owning and maintaining them. This can lead to increased disposable income for individuals and families, which can in turn be reinvested in the economy.

However, some may argue that limiting car usage is unrealistic and that it would be difficult to enforce. While it is true that enforcing car usage restrictions can be challenging, there are examples of successful implementation in other countries. For example, Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has implemented a strict car ownership policy and has seen a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions as a result.

Another potential counterargument is that limiting car usage would be too restrictive and would limit individual freedom. However, it is important to note that limiting car usage is not about completely banning cars, but rather about reducing their usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation. This can include public transportation, walking, and cycling, which can provide individuals with more freedom and flexibility in their daily lives.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and economic costs. While it is important to consider counterarguments and potential challenges, there are examples of successful implementation in other countries, and the benefits of reducing car usage make it a worthwhile consideration. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation and reducing our reliance on cars, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and our planet.",1,945
" In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Michael Choose, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS for short, enables computers to identify human emotions. Although this technology sounds helpful in a variety of situations, for example detecting whether an athlete is in pain following a major injury, I believe that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. This is because it is invasive and defeats the purpose of education.

Those in favor of using FACS in an educational setting might argue that it would be a useful tool to ensure that students are paying attention. Indeed, the article describes a situation in which instructors, by collecting data on a student's facial expressions, were able to determine whether the student was paying attention or not. However, there are many non-invasive ways to ensure students are engaged, for example through participation or regular homework. While using facial recognition software may be more efficient, it comes at the cost of privacy and personal space.

Those who disagree may argue that it is a waste of time to collect data on facial expressions, as any determined student could easily learn to mask their facial expressions and fool the software. Furthermore, even if every student was expressionless, that does not mean they are not paying attention or are not interested; they may simply be deep in thought. Thus, previous implementations of FACS in a classroom have been unsuccessful, and it is not a sound investment.

While the article describes how FACS can be used to help diagnose autism, the technology could easily be misused. For example, instead of using it to diagnose medical conditions such as autism, it could be used to discriminate against students with mental disabilities. As there is no way of stopping the technology from being used in such a manner, it poses a serious risk and thus should not be introduced into classrooms.

Those against my viewpoint may argue that FACS can be useful in helping teachers understand students' expressions and thus tailor their teaching methods accordingly. While this is true, it once again highlights the potential for the technology to be misused, as a teacher may adapt their teaching method in a manner that disadvantages a particular student.

In conclusion, while the article describes FACS as a breakthrough in facial recognition, I believe that it should not be used in a classroom setting. It is an invasive technology that threatens the privacy of students, and it risks being misused. Therefore, I do not believe that using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable.",1,946
"People ask for advice and feedback almost every day. It could be advice regarding fashion, education, or artistic feedback. For example, imagine a student finishing a project she's been working on for quite a while. Before turning the assignment in, this student will most likely ask her peers for their opinions on it. However, notice how she won't ask one single person, rather multiple people for feedback.

Seeking multiple opinions and advice can help someone make better decisions by understanding and seeing different perspectives on the subject, and receiving new ideas they previously have never thought of.

Asking a single person for his opinion will only result in one perspective of the topic. If people were to ask and receive only one response, the outcome becomes very limited and may not connect with a large audience. In order for it to apply to the audience, everyone would have to have the exact same thought process and opinions as the person the author asked; which is very unlikely. If someone wishes to connect with a variety of people, in this case a larger audience, they must have an understanding of many perspective and points of view. This way the outcome will apply to more people with different thoughts and opinions.

When someone gives feedback, it's usually based off of the original idea that was given. However, there are scenarios where the advice given provides a brand-new idea regarding the topic. Asking more than one person for advice and feedback allows a person to suggest ideas and concepts one may never have thought of. To put into context, a student asks her peer for feedback regarding her art project. While most of her friends give feedback and opinions that relate to her project, one of her friends gives advice that suggests a new idea to add onto her original project. Not only does the student know how to strengthen what she has already made, she can now add a new element that benefits her assignment.

Seeking multiple opinions and advice can be beneficial to someone because it can provide new ideas that previously have never been thought of, and help understand different perspectives on the topic. It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience. Overall, asking peers for their opinions can be an eye-opener, and refresh one's mind in order to get their point across a variety of people. The more feedback one receives, the stronger the outcome becomes. ",0,947
"Looking at the factors of being able to visit Venus the author has some great points in the passage due to how dangerous it seems, The author is very correct on even asking why scientists are so drawn to visiting this unexplored planet for good reasons alone. The planet Venus has some pros and also cons. It may well once was a planet just like Earth a long time ago but that we only know. And some pros is that maybe that planet could possibly even help scientists with new possible discoveries.

Elon Musk is one who is also trying something beyond of what we have ever set our sights on. He is trying to find a way to colonize Mars!!, yet we also have plans to visit Venus. The Author also has some very good points on why it's so difficult to even get close to the planet at all. When stated ""Each previous emission was unmanned, and for a good reason"" in paragraph 2 is almost foreshadowing the dangers of the planned Venus.

Due to a very thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blanket Venus is one of the dangers of the planet, so looking at the factors again on why the Author thinks why Venus is very difficult to set foot on or even get close to, We can just look at the planet from a safe distance.

"Everyone has dreamed about aliens living on Mars at least once in their life. As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on Mars, there is no evidence today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. The Face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the Face here on Earth.

When analyzing a digital image, you can discern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars.

Here on Earth we have many types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures? There is no evidence that proves the Face could have been created by alien life forms.

In conclusion, although everyone here on Earth would love to discover that the Face was created by aliens, there is no evidence that can prove that theory. There are not any alien markings and there are landforms on Earth that look very similar to the Face on Mars.",0,949
"Many people believe that owning and using a car or other motorized vehicles is an advantage. But is it really? Citizens might be able to get somewhere faster or not have to exert the energy to get there. But is it worth polluting the air, taking up all that space and creating traffic and frustrated citizens, and creating the mindset of a lazy, human being? Maybe instead of spending money on a car, citizens wouldn't be in as much debt, some kids might have college already paid for, and some citizens have their housing paid for. Therefor, this is making happier, stress-free, citizens.

The pollution of the air is a major argument for people who support the non-usage of cars or other motorized vehicles. In Source 1: In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal claims that motorized vehicles play a major part in the pollution of the air. Rosenthal says that Europe is responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the United States is responsible for up to 50 percent.

Most of the time, traffic causes a driver to be frustrated. What causes traffic? Vehicles. So why does everybody drive them? In small, well-populated suburbs, traffic is a major issue. With the dense population and the majority of those citizens driving vehicles, traffic is very easily created. Thus, making more citizens frustrated and creating road rage. Road rage also causes more accidents which causes more deaths. Making driving, a dangerous thing. Although, citizens still drive motorized vehicles. Most of the time it is to get to a certain place in a short amount of time, but if a destination is closer than one mile, there is no excuse to use a vehicle to get there. But most citizens do. This creates a lazy mind set.

The average cost of a brand-new car is roughly $30,000. If citizens avoid buying a car, it would be a great benefit for them. $30,000 can pay off college, or help with bills or debt, or payoff housing. With more money, this creates happier, and less stressed citizens.

The creation of ""car dues"", and ""car-free days"" could make a huge difference in the environment, economy, safety, traffic, and even the health and stress of a citizen. Although most people still believe that having a car is an advantage, it can be. But not having a car or not using a car as much is a much greater advantage. Not just to an individual, but to society as a whole.  ",0,950
"The FACS(Facial

Action Coding System) is a computer software that can scan the muscles of someone's face and tell the emotions that person is feeling. The FACS seems like a very useless piece of software.

In the article, you read about how they used this software to ""decode"" the face of the Mona Lisa. The software was said to have worked and was able to tell the emotions she was feeling that very day. She was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Using this type of software on students in class will be useless and also a waste of time. Decoding the face of a student in class won't change anything in the classroom. Paragraph six, line six, the author is telling how we can use the software to tell when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and is able to modify the lesson for the that student. Using this software would only be efficient to those who learn on computers. A teacher could not use this software on a big class full of students because she would get different emotions from many students. The teacher would not be able to give a lesson for just a couple of students in class based on the FACS

The FACS(Facial Action Coding System) would be useless for students. Online schooling could use this software, but students in a classroom would make the software useless ",0,951
"Studying abroad is an excellent way to gain new experiences, explore new cultures, and broaden one's horizons. In recent years, many colleges and universities have made it mandatory for students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country. In my opinion, I strongly agree that colleges and universities should require their students to study abroad for several reasons.

Firstly, studying abroad helps students to develop independence and self-reliance. When students study in a foreign country, they are forced to navigate a new environment and adjust to a new culture. This requires them to be self-sufficient and responsible for their own well-being. For instance, they will have to manage their finances, communicate with locals in a foreign language, and navigate unfamiliar regulations. These experiences help them to develop skills that will be useful for the rest of their lives, such as problem-solving and decision-making.

Secondly, studying abroad provides students with the opportunity to learn a new language or improve their language skills. Living in a foreign country will expose students to a new language and culture, forcing them to practice their language skills every day. This immersive experience provides a more profound understanding of the language and it's nuances than learning in a classroom. Moreover, learning a new language will open up more job opportunities and enhance social interactions.

Thirdly, studying abroad broadens the student's perspective and increases their understanding of the world. When students study abroad, they are exposed to different cultures, ideas, and beliefs. They become more aware of the world beyond their own country and, as a result, become more open-minded and tolerant. They learn about cultural differences and similarities, which allows them to understand and appreciate diversity. This cultural awareness is essential in today's globalized world, where the ability to interact with diverse groups of people is becoming increasingly important.

Finally, studying abroad enhances a student's resume and increases their chances of getting a job. Employers are always looking for candidates who have international experience and a global perspective. Students who have studied abroad have demonstrated that they are adaptable, flexible, and can thrive in different environments. They have also gained valuable language and intercultural skills that can be applied in the workplace. In addition, the experience of studying abroad provides students with a unique talking point in job interviews, which can help them stand out from other candidates.

In conclusion, studying abroad is an excellent opportunity that should be mandatory for all college and university students. It provides a range of benefits, including personal growth, language acquisition, cultural awareness, and career prospects. By studying abroad, students develop skills that will be useful for the rest of their lives, and they become better equipped to navigate an increasingly globalized world. Therefore, colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.

"Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.

Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.

Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.

Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do. Teachers are the ones ensuring that their students are prepared and know the material, and it is their responsibility to prepare their students for their curriculum. At the end of the day, the students are not the ones getting paid to teach their students.",0,953
"Dear Principal,

I think students should have to do community service. In my opinion community service helps kids become better citizens.

First, let's say someone is cleaning up litter as community service. By cleaning a park or the playground at a school the community would seem like a clean place to live. More people would be interested in moving here. They would think, 'Look at how clean it is!' or, 'What a great place to live'. Cleaning up trash as community service wouldn't only benefit our community, it would benefit our planet. We would help reduce pollution in the air and global warming.

Someone who disagrees with me might say that kids should have an opinion on whether to do community service. But think of this: how many kids actually want to do community service. Would you have done community service as a kid, I think not?

Lastly, community service would give kids something to do in the afternoon. More kids would stay out of trouble. Fewer kids would spend their afternoon playing video games. I honestly think that community service would have a positive effect on students.

"Dear Principal,

I am writing to respectfully provide my view on whether community service should be required for all students. While helping the community is undoubtedly important, I do not think requiring community service is the best approach.

Some benefits of community service are clear. It allows youth to contribute to meaningful causes, learn the value of volunteering, and gain experience that can help their personal and professional development. For students who already see the value in volunteering, making it a requirement would validate their efforts. And in some cases, mandatory service may inspire a lifelong commitment to volunteering. 

However, requiring community service risks diminishing its positive impact. When volunteering is compulsory rather than motivated by personal choice, some students may resent it and see it as a chore rather than an opportunity. As a result, the quality of their work could suffer. Mandatory service may also negatively impact students who have limited free time due to jobs, family responsibilities or other commitments. Rather than feeling empowered, these students could become stressed or resentful about having to squeeze in hours of mandated work on top of their other obligations.

Instead of making service compulsory, I think the best approach is to continue encouraging it of students' own volition. The school can promote existing volunteer programs and explore new ways of partnering with community organizations, which helps those in need while allowing students to opt in based on their interests and availability. For those who are still unsure, inviting past volunteers to share their experiences may inspire others to get involved. While maintaining high standards of civic participation, this approach respects students' freedom and time while fostering truly meaningful, self-guided service.

In closing, while the ideals of community service are admirable, mandatory programs risk burdening students and reducing volunteers' motivation. I believe voluntary service, supported through promotion and leading by positive example, can achieve civic goals while respecting individuals' choices. Thank you for consideration of my perspective on this important issue.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,955
"Dear my state senator.

I have some concerns I would like u to know, it's about the electoral college.

I know that it is a process not a place and that the funding fathers established it and all but to me, I don't think the electoral college is fair and here's why.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral votes that is required to elect president, now under the 23rd Amendment the constitution, District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in the of November. To be honest you help choose your electors when it's time to vote for president because when they vote for a candidate they are actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential election a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of the respective electors.

The electoral college, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. Consider the state legislatures are technically are to blame for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of people.

Now I have done some more research and what I also found out is that back in 1960, segregation in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in doing away with Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john F. Kennedy. It also happened in Hawaii in 1960, but Vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent's electors, I mean what if this happens again?

And i also heard that if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this that in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have an impacted deadlocked the election. It also has happened many times after that. I mean the election is only a few swings away from catastrophe.

It's official to me and a lot of other people, the electoral college is unfair, and irrational. I mean I have been told that the best arguments in the favor of it's most assertions without the basis in reality. I think you need to put a stop to this before things go wrong, I mean if it's not fair then why do it? It makes no sense.

Thank you for taking the time to read me letter and I hope I helped about the electoral college to be fair.

Sincerally a concerned citizen.  ",0,956
"Do you ever want more opinions and options when it comes to advice? Well you can! You can simply ask more than one person for their opinion, so you can choose yours! It is good to go to multiple sources for opinions, because it opens your mind up to new things, you can get good or bad feed back, and you can now see things from different points of views.

Seeking for more opinions can open your mind up for new and different things. This can help you think outside the box and form new thoughts on a situation. Thinking outside the box can help you be more creative and have a different/new look on your problem. You can also ask advice from new people or people you normally wouldn't ask advice from. By doing this you could solve your problem/situation with new and different things that this person could help you find. Lastly, knowing how to ask multiple people for advice can help you later in life. This can be helpful when you have to work with others in a job, and you need to understand that you are not the only one with good ideas, and you need to know that asking for help is a good thing that can make whatever you are working on even better with even more minds. Therefor asking many people for advice can help your mind open up for new and different things.

You can see things from different points of views. You can get a better understanding of that person. By this I mean you can see their perspectives, and can maybe get to know them more based off their advice. The person that is giving you advice could have gone through similar situations. If they have been through something similar then they could have good advice on it and what you should or should not do, and the right way of taking care of the situation. The person giving you advice could have also been through different things. But this can still help when receiving advice because they will see things different, and having a completely different mind from yours can still be good and helpful. Overall, you should always try and see things from different points of views.

You can also be open to feedback by asking peers for their opinions. This can help cancel something's out when the advice is given, and can cancel out the bad ideas for whatever the advice is needed for. Canceling out ideas is a good strategy when needing advice or opinions so you can separate the good from the bad in the situation. Feedback can come in good or bad ways like constructive criticism. For example someone could give good advice that the person may not want to hear, but they still should to be open to it. Some people may have their mind already made up about their conflict/situation, and just may want some extra thoughts. That is why feedback is good because it is small, and you are still making the decision for your self, just with commentary of others. As you can see feedback is a good strategy when needing advice from others.

Seeking out multiple people for good advice is a good strategy. This is because it makes it easy to cancel out bad ideas, to collect feedback, and to have a more open mind to new things. Therefor seeking different sources for advice is very useful.",0,957
"Phones and driving

This essay is about if drivers should or not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road.

Using your cellphone can actually be deadly. Because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective.

Using your cell phone while driving is very common nowadays. When people use their cell phones while driving it sometimes has a negative effect. Cell phone usage while driving is a common occurrence in today's society. Unfortunately, it often has a negative impact on drivers using phones and those surrounding them. Because of the growing popularity of cellular devices in modern society, the urge for the public to use their phones frequently is severe.

When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second. Many deadly accidents are caused by someone bending down to simply pick up their phone that fell on the floor of the car. Many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens. That's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours.  ",0,958
"Alright, so this facial emotional technology that's supposed to know your emotion based on your facial expressions is wack. The articles say something about how being able to read student's emotions in class is valuable.

The article states that the computer will read a students emotion and modify the lesson if they seem bored or confused. Okay so if the student is confused there needs to be a more simple way to put the lesson. How will the computer decide with way is more simple. What if its more simple way is actually more confusing. Or let's say the student is bored, we have the same problem. There isn't much a computer can do to make it more fun. I mean can you even make it more fun besides just wording it differently? It isn't an effective way to do it and even harder for a computer to do so. It's far easier for a human instructor to word the lesson differently than a computer because the computer lacks the real connection that a person can have with you.

Then there's is chance that the students' emotion isn't even related to the lesson, but may be from the outside. Maybe they got mad at someone, a loved one died, a breakup maybe, or even hears parents got divorced. Not only would it be hard for a computer to determine the emotion is caused by an outside force but even to figure a way to help. The technology may even be wasted on helping students when there could be better use for it.

The article doesn't give you much evidence as to whether this would help besides saying it will modify the lesson. How, in what way?

Not only would it be difficult to do this, but would it even be effective? So maybe it is a little effective and the computer can put some things on screen to make you happy, but if it isn't that effective then there is no good uses for it and no one will use it. If you are creating something that can add value or help people in some way, it can't just be barely effective or even just a little. The cost of making this, testing it, and everything else going into the program, and for it to just kind of work is not an effective way to help people or even get them to consider using it because it will just waste their time more than anything.

At the end of the day we humans have to complex emotions to create something to not only recognize our emotions (which is the easier part), but to help us when feeling negative emotions.",0,959
"Dear; state senator

It states that keeping the electoral college is a more promising way to vote for the President of the United States. If they change it to election by popular vote then it probably won't be fair. Just like in 1960 when they send two slates of electors to congress, but that was probably because they had the popular vote and not the electoral college.

The electoral college is a process, not a place people might have thought that is what place like maybe a college [school]. The thing is who ever thought that was wrong because it was found by the father established it in the constitution as a compromise. It's a long story lets just cut to the chase the electoral college consists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect president. On the other had the third is if you elect your president by the popular then the required number will be higher and possible won't have a president because they will never finish counting the votes.

Electoral college is the best way to go because like that will only have one slate of electors. But if the popular vote then most likely will end up with two or more slates of electors and personality I wouldn't like that. It would be better just to stick with the electoral college so people and the congress wouldn't have to go through so much work just to pick a president.

Look also if the popular vote that doesn't mean that they will win most likely they will lose the presidency for example Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 percent of the voters. See having the popular vote wouldn't be the best thing to do. Just stay with the electoral college don't make it so hard on people.  ",0,960
"Should summer projects be designed by students or teachers? I believe that summer projects should be designed by teachers, not students because the students won't know much about the class because they haven't taken that class. So how could they make a project about a topic they don't know much about? If students got to design their own projects how would teachers grade them if they are all completely different? Would there be just be one cubic? How would teachers use just that one rubric for completely different projects?

How could students make a project about a topic that they don't know much about? Students wouldn't be able to make a summer project because they don't know much about that topic. I believe that if you are going to make a project or an assignment you must know about the topic that you are making the project on. That's why I feel like teachers should make the projects because they know what the topic is about. If the students design the projects it wouldn't make sense and would probably be all over the place and not organized, because they have probably never designed a project on their own. The project also wouldn't have a good structure because the students wouldn't know where to even star with the project.

How would teachers grade the summer projects when they are completely different? This is another reason why I believe that teachers should make the projects, because if they let students make their own projects they are going to be completely different, so they can't be graded the same. If students were to design their own projects I feel like it would take way longer to grade than if teachers designed it because each project is unique and different. If the students design the projects then there would be no structure to the grading so the teachers won't know how they should grade the project. So if teachers were to design the summer projects you would get a little taste of how the class, assignments, and grading would be like, but if you make your own assignment you won't know what to expect for that class.

Would there only be one rubric?

If so how would teachers use one rubric for completely different projects? If teachers designed the summer projects they would only need one rubric because the project would be the same for every student, but if students designed their own projects how would the teacher use only one rubric for different projects because they won't be the same. When teachers assign you a project they give you a rubric on how they are going to grade you, but if students make the project they wouldn't be able to get a rubric on how the teacher would grade their project because they are the ones making the project. So if the students made their own project would they have to make their own rubric as well?

If teachers design the projects they will know how to grade it, they will know what to put on the project, and there would only be one rubric so everyone's project would be graded equally. Teachers should also design the summer projects because summer projects are really important, it is the first assignment you get in that class. When your teachers assign you your summer project you get a little taste of what the class and assignments will be like. You also get a little taste of what grading would be like as well, so you know what to expect in the class. These are the reasons why I feel teachers should make the summer projects instead of the students.",0,961
"Did you know that in some car intensive areas in the United States 50 percent of pollution come from car emissions? 50 percent, that's half of the pollution in a city or area just off of cars alone. That's a huge number, to huge if you ask me. But some steps are being taken to lower of car emissions around the world. Creating communities like Vauban, Germany, also by banning driving and having car free days. These are something that have taken place in order to lower car emissions.

In the suburbs of Vauban cars are not a factor in everyday life. There is no street parking, driveways and no home garages. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. People get around by walking, bicycling and the occasional tram. This drastically reduces greenhouse gases. In result this is one of the cleanest communities to live in.

In Paris after days of near record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban. Motorists with even numbered license plates were ""ordered to leaf their cars at home or suffer a fine. The same thing would happen with odd numbered plates the following. Car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital city of France. That helped the city a lot, enough to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.

Bogotá celebrates a car-free day. Hiking, biking, skating and bus riding all great chooses to get from place to place on this day. This helps to clean the air around us and help us breath better air. The goal of this is to reduce smog in the air. Other countries have also taken notice and started doing this as well.",0,962
"While the idea of the ""Face on Mars"" being created by aliens is intriguing, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that it is simply a natural landform formed by geological processes over time. There are several reasons why the Face should be considered a naturally occurring mesa rather than evidence of extraterrestrial visitation.

Firstly, high-resolution images of the Face reveal that it lacks distinct features one would expect of a constructed face, such as eye sockets, a nose, or other facial details. Upon closer inspection, the supposed ""face"" falls apart and simply resembles an eroded cliff with shadows creating parabolic patterns. If aliens deliberately constructed a giant face, they likely would have included distinctive facial characteristics rather than leaving a vague outline open to various interpretations. 

Another key point is that Mars experiences strong winds that are capable of shaping rock formations over millennia. The solar system's only known currents capable of carving rock are wind and water, and there is no evidence water ever flowed on this part of Mars. The scattered mesas in the surrounding terrain show how wind erosion sculpted the local rock. It is quite reasonable that natural wind erosion over eons could form something resembling a human face purely by chance, without requiring alien intervention.

Finally, as technology has advanced, we have gained a better understanding of surface features and geological processes on Mars through instruments like high-resolution cameras and spectrometers. Features that may have seemed bizarre from low-quality images have turned out to have rational scientific explanations. There is no compelling chemical, geological or visual evidence that definitively proves the Face is anything other than a naturally formed mesa. Extraordinary claims of alien construction require extraordinary evidence, which has not been found.

In conclusion, while the chance coincidence of a face-shaped mesa on Mars captures people's imagination, the preponderance of scientific evidence points to the Face being a product of natural forces rather than alien design. Further study of the surrounding terrain and comparisons to wind erosion on Earth strongly support classifying it as just another weathered Martian landform. Unless compelling proof of its artificial nature is discovered, the safest conclusion is that it is a natural wonder, not a monument left by visitors from another world.",1,963
"The claim for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions are amazing, and could benefit a low risk of suicide and bullying of other students or people. The technology could keep peoples mind focused and maybe make them more open-minded. Like if you were sad and the computer detected that then the computer might pop up a game or video hat could make you feel differently.

The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. The muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them.

The conclusion to this statement is that new technology could be a good thing doing through the decades of the universe. Mostly because some people don't know how to show their emotions, or hide them from their friends and family and could really be feeling self vulnerable or have a very low self-esteem of themselves.",0,964
"Imagine not having to wake up earlier in order to shower, eat and put clothes on. Some schools have the convenient choice to let students study from home via online courses or through video. Some Students are fortunate enough to learn from their own home so, they wouldn't go through these minor setbacks. Many students wish they were able to learn from home and not having to go to a public or private school. Students could also take courses that are necessary for them and could help them with things that really are needed for the rest of their lives. For these students learning from home brings many benefits because, students would not worry about getting to school, they would still be able to learn while sick, and they would learn at a pace they needed to.

First, the students wouldn't worry about how they were going to get to school. Students could relax a lot more knowing that they did not have to make those sacrifices to get to school. Having to make it on time to school adds an defense amount pressure to a student, because they know that their teacher would be angry for being late to their class, but when taking online courses they would be able to learn from home and not worry about making it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing because being late could have you getting lectures for hours on end and could get you in trouble with your administrator, which is why when you learn from home you could do it any time throughout your day because it's an online course and it's available at all times, when you also learn from home you're able to take your time on certain activities and such other tasks. Depending on the weather that could be even more time-consuming, for example if it's snowing you would have to warm your vehicle up in order to be able to drive it, and for people who walk to school they suffer the most because they have to either sweat or be so cold on the way to school and on the way back.

Second, students wouldn't have to make it to school even when sick. Many schools suggest that students should stay home when sick in order to prevent the sickness from getting every other person in that building sick. When a student takes an online course, they could still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things, all because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take the online courses area lot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do, they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book until they complete the test on what ever make up day is assigned to them. When students who take online sources miss the test day they could complete it when ever, just because it's online, and it won't have to be taken on hard copy.

Lastly, the student would be able to learn at he paces that they desire. Students who attend public schools know that they don't always move at the desirable pace because there are many others in there learning with them. For example when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or the teacher is really slow. But when online you could have the teacher to please repeat themselves and move at the pace you would really like to. When a teacher has a class of twenty-plus kids she/ he really can't give you undivided attention because there are so many students in that class. For students who take the online classes they could have full attention of the teacher because every student has one specific teacher assigned to just for them, with this they are able to learn a lot more and are able to move from subject to subject a lot quicker. The student who take the online class will also move at a much faster rate, because they wouldn't have any sort of distractions, but would give the teacher a lot more attention than they would in a public class.

Some schools across the United States offer students the choice to take online courses from home. This helps many students that have problems getting to school and home, it allows students to learn at the pace they will be more successful at, and would help when a student is not feeling well enough to go to school. Many of the students wish they were able to take an online course, which is much better than an online school.",0,965
"Dear Principle,

I agree with your idea to keep students from playing sports unless they have a grade B average or higher. This idea, if carried through, will have a positive effect on the school for many reasons. These reasons include more discipline, and higher academic performance. Please make your idea a fact, and do not let students play sports unless they have at least a B grade.

Though the connection isn't as obvious as other reasons, student's discipline will in fact be improved. Students will want to pay more attention to their teachers so that they will get the higher grade and in turn, play sports. The fact is, that learning comes from listening. They couldn't get a higher grade if they did not learn. Also, students will be less inclined to act up. When a student distracts the class, nothing is being learned. Grades will have no chance to go up. The thought of not being able to play on the sports team is a great persuasion to many people. Finally, it is common knowledge that boys in middle and high schools are more likely to be ""cool"" if they participate in sports. Other students are always trying to mirror the popular people in hopes of becoming popular as well. If they suddenly see the popular kids listening and being good in school, it is likely that they will also copy that.

Higher academic performance should be strived for in all schools, but unfortunately, there will always be those few ""bad apples"" that can spoil the bunch. But there is always some sport that will interest people. Even those ""bad apples"". If they suddenly can't play there favorite sport anymore, then they will be prone to do almost whatever it takes to get back in. Even raise their grades. Secondly, sports can clash with homework. If a student that plays sports can not get their homework done after practice, then they have to make time. School can't be cut out, so sports must go for them. Playing on a team is a privileged, not a requirement. Finally, I have already said in my second paragraph that people try to copy the cool kids. That means that not only are the people who want to play sports going to get better grades, but so are the people who copy them.

Please make it so, and do not let any people who have lower than a B average play sports. My reasons are higher discipline in your school, and higher academic performance. Nothing negative could come out of this. Only something greatly positive. I am a student, and I support your idea. More students support me.",0,966
"""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal. To understand Rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slow. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.

Firstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in Colombia used public transportation during a car free day ""leaving the streets of this capital city "", according to Andrew Silky, ""eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Hadron Walter states ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. When an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. Limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Silky ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"". Fewer cars mean healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.

Secondly, listing car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Nowadays people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yes;pollution is bad for the environment. Yes; a bad endowment means unhealthy living. Yes; cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completely dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.

Additionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possession. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As David Goldberg says ""all our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly developed. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective development. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal ""cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway"". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. People have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage, these effects could be controlled.

To conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. Limiting car usage is a positive way to enforce an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be referred to as a successful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.  ",0,967
"Have you ever thought about what life would be like on Venus? Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star"", is said to be a challenge when it comes to exploring. The author develops a main point that Venus is a fascinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped.

First, Venus, also known to be Earths ""twin"", is a mystery. The author tells the readers about what past explorations have been like and why no one is living or has traveled to Venus in almost three decades. """"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."". The author also tells of why no spacecraft has been able to survive the landing on Venus. ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."". However, that does not stop scientist from trying to create more explorations to gain more research.

In addition to the surface being inhospitable, that does not stop scientist from planning more explorations to gain more research. The author asks us, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface?"". Well we are told that, ""Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those son Earth."". Which tells us that even scientist are still figuring out how Earth became Earth, and if Venus was just like Earth. Which leads to more research and more information.

Finally, we are told about how a-like Earth and Venus are through the research of the scientists. Which scientist believe we should not stop our travels just because of dangers. In paragraph 8 the author states,"" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". This shows that the author does not believe that the danger should hold us back and stop us from exploring. In the same paragraph it also states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

Over all, the author develops a main point that Venus is a fascinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped. By showing the readers that there is more than what meets the eye when talking about Venus. Also, that one should never let danger stop them from exploring.",0,968
"I believe that driverless cars are a great invention for the people. It would be great for anybody in my personal opinion. I believe the sensors, Dubbed LIDAR, and GPS receiver are great idea's for a driverless car. Say you spilled a drink while you were driving, and you needed to grab the cup before the liquid from the cup gets all over your school bag, or work portfolio? You could always switch on the ""driverless"" car feature and clean it up real quick before you started driving again. I like how you can switch this on and off. Say you were feeling sleepy, and you were awake, but you were kinda drowsy? You could use the driverless care feature. The vibrating seats from Gm, The flashing lights informing you that there's something you need to do so take the wheel. Those are both great and fantastic idea's.

Safety is a big concern in these cars. Can the car stop when needed? Can the car set off-air bags in the middle of a crash, so the crash is less deadly and there are no fatalities?

Yes, I believe the cars in the future will be able to do everything listed above, and more. If somebody is injured by a smart car I believe it should be the manufactures fault, but only if the person driving the car is actually using the smart car feature. If the person driving the car isn't using the feature then the driver should be held responsible",0,969
"Dear Principal Smith, 

I am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy that is currently under review. Of the two options being considered, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. Allowing students to bring their phones but requiring them to be turned off during class time strikes the right balance.

If phones were completely banned as in Policy 2, it could cause issues. Many students rely on their phones to contact parents for rides after school or to coordinate after school activities and jobs. An outright ban would make communicating very difficult. It could also lead to students hiding their phones on campus instead of following the rules. Policy 1 avoids these potential problems by still permitting phone use during free periods. 

Policy 1 also recognizes that most students are responsible with technology use. By allowing phones but limiting use to non-academic times, it teaches students how to appropriately integrate phones into their daily lives. They can still stay in touch with friends and family outside of class in a controlled manner. Completely banning phones does not set students up for managing technology use appropriately as adults. 

Most importantly, Policy 1 supports a learning environment where students can focus during lessons and discussions. However, it does not overly punish all students for the actions of a few by confiscating phones entirely. This balanced approach is fairest for the student body and best prepares them for adult responsibilities.

For these reasons, I believe Policy 1 is the better cell phone policy for our school. It both facilitates communication yet maintains an engaged classroom setting. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my recommendation. I am happy to discuss this issue further.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,970
"Sir Winston Churchill remains a powerful example of perseverance and success despite failure. Churchill was a British statesman most famously known for his leadership during WW2. However, his successes as a politician did not come easy. Despite experiencing a multitude of failures early in his life, he refused to give in and kept pushing himself forward, ultimately becoming one of Britain's most legendary figures. His famous quote, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”, emphasizes the importance of not giving up in the face of difficulty, instead persevering and striving for success.

To understand better how to continue striving in the face of repeated failure, let’s examine a hypothetical scenario. A student is struggling to pass a difficult college course and has already failed the course four times. It would be easy for the student to become disheartened and give up, especially with the overwhelming challenge of preparing for and taking yet another exam. But that student must remember Churchill’s advice and take courage in the knowledge that failure can lead to success if it is met with dedication and consistency. 

To support not losing enthusiasm after failure, an essay should emphasize that life is full of challenges and how failure is inextricably linked to success. Point out the detrimental mental, emotional, and physical effects of allowing the persistence of failure to cause someone to give up. Remind readers that a success story is more than just endings and that the path to success is likely to be filled with setbacks. Finally, encourage readers that re-centering and recalibrating after failure is a normal part of life and essential for anyone seeking to reach their goals. 

On a personal or professional level, it is important to remain consistent and not give up after failure. Through researching the achievements of Winston Churchill and exploring a hypothetical scenario, it has become clear that the courage to continue despite failure is the only way to experience lasting success.",1,971
"I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, rather than compete. There are many reasons for this belief.

First, cooperation is more likely to lead to success than competition. Studies show that competition almost always leads to loser syndrome, in which individuals lose focus, give up, and become negative in their attitudes and behavior. In contrast, cooperation leads to synergy, or the enhancement of the abilities of those involved.

Second, competition can be harmful to the development of self-confidence and self-esteem. When children are often forced to compete against others, they may begin to feel inferior and insecure. This can have a negative impact on their overall well-being.

Third, competition often leads to bitterness and hostility. When one person wins and the others lose, it can be difficult to maintain friendships. In fact, some studies have even shown that competition can lead to violence.

In conclusion, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, rather than compete. This is because cooperation leads to success, is more likely to lead to positive attitudes and feelings, is beneficial to the development of self-confidence and self-esteem, and is less likely to lead to violence.

"Dear Principle,

I personally think that you should require all the students from our school to do community services for many reasons. One reason is that it will teach you a lesson, also that it will keep students from doing bad things, and it will influence younger kids to do not litter because if they do, they will have to do community serves also in the future.

Doing community services is good for you because you are helping others and helping others will show you how people are in need with will lead to energies with will be used to help others in the future.

The other reason is also that it will keep students from being outside. Being outside your home means that there are people that don't want you and that will lead you in the bad path and doing community serves will keep you from going in the bad direction.

The last reason why I think that you should require all students to do community serves is that it will influence little kids to not liter because then they will do community serves",0,973
"Electoral College is the way American people get to chose who they want to represent their state or country. Why get rid of a system that has few flaws and gives people a since of picking their people? Electoral College should be kept because gives candidates a fair chance and lets everyone pick a representation.

To begin, electoral college gives candidates a fair chance. In source 3 it states"" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This explains that even if only a candidate only represent one region of the country electoral college can still give them a chance to win presidency. In source 1 it states"" Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This means electoral college gives a candidate a group of supporters to help him or her win an election.

Furthermore, electoral college gives the people a right to pick a representation. In source 1 it states"" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". Everyone who is a United States citizen has the right to vote for whom they want for representation for each state. In source 3 it states"" Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". Thoughtful votes or people who just vote because everyone else is doing it doesn't matter. Everyone could vote for anyone with electoral college.

""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college"". I disagree with this statement because the electoral college gives candidates a fair chance to win elections and the people get to pick who they want to represent their states.

In conclusion, electoral college should be kept because it gives candidates a fair chance and allows the people to pick who they want to represent them.",0,974
" As we move forward in time, it is important to reflect on who we are now and how we have evolved from the past. Character traits are an integral part of our identity, and they begin to develop in our teenage years. As we grow older, we keep some traits and discard others, often influenced by our choices or external factors. Many people strive to change themselves, whether it's for others or for their own personal growth.

When we know who we want to be as individuals, we begin to cultivate traits that align with our goals. For example, someone who wants to be a successful businessperson may start learning about finance and leadership, while someone who wants to be an artist may focus on their creative skills. Character traits are the qualities that others notice about us, such as our sense of style, interests, and behaviors.

It is fascinating to observe the different character traits that people exhibit, and we can learn a lot from them. For instance, we may notice that one person is always impeccably dressed and well-groomed, while another is more casual and laid-back. We may also notice that one person is very outgoing and social, while another is more introverted and reserved. Despite our differences, we can all learn from each other and strive to become the best versions of ourselves.

However, it is important to recognize that character traits are not entirely beyond our control. While we may inherit certain traits from our parents or upbringing, we have the power to shape and develop them over time. We can learn new skills, challenge ourselves to try new things, and surround ourselves with positive influences to help us grow and evolve.

In conclusion, character traits are an essential part of our identity and play a significant role in shaping who we are as individuals. As we move forward in time, we have the power to continue learning and growing, and to become the best versions of ourselves that we can be.",1,975
"Senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College establishes judgement and fairness by giving upcoming presidents a fair shot. People have voices and the popular vote can be biased from state to state. The process if mature because they chose unbiased electors, and there is a majority of 270 electoral votes. The Electoral College has 538 electors, which gives a good amount of unbiased people. They figure this amount by one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for the Senators, which you could be one.

The Electoral College is one of the best ways to keep a fair election. We people do not make the brightest decisions sometimes, and the Electoral College keeps us from making the wrong decision for who is going to be our next president.

People can be easily affected into turning on a candidate. They could not realize that the candidate would be a great president. The Electoral College gives the candidates a fair chance. The member of the Electoral College are fair and know what is best for the country. The specific Electoral electors for your state vote what the state wants, and is not biased on what other senators or electors want. This gives the people a good amount of say in the election.

Electoral College keeps the people in line and gives the people a sense of establishment. The election of the president is every four years. This gives people time to decide on a new president and who they want representing their votes. Overall the Electoral College is one of the brightest decisions that America has made. For one the Electoral College gives people a fair chance in becoming president. Also, the Electoral College helps make the voting process a lot easier.

We people don't yet understand why there are not more people realizing that there is an Electoral College, and what underlies is a great idea and even a better reality.  ",0,976
"Failure is a natural part of the pursuit of success. When we fail, we learn from our mistakes and persevere in finding ways to succeed. Without taking risks, we would never reach our goals and be able to fully achieve our potential. Alongside taking chances and learning from our mistakes, enthusiasm also plays an essential role in our success. Being passionate and driven motivates us to stay focused and empowered. When we put effort into our projects and dreams, we increase our chances of succeeding and reaping the rewards for our hard work.

By understanding that failure is a necessary part of success and embracing our enthusiasm, we can reach our goals and be successful.",1,977
"Everyone, at some point in their lives, has made a decision. Whether it be as small as what to eat for lunch or as big as what job you want to have for the rest of your life, but some people try to get others opinions to help make these decisions. Getting opinions from other people to help make decisions can help with getting a different point of view, having more experience in a topic, and having more knowledge about a topic.

Something someone might have that you don't is a different point of view(POV). Someone else might view someone differently, whether it be a better or a worse POV. You might have seen this person as a good person all your life, but your friend might think otherwise. Someone else also might think of somewhere differently because where the live or have been. For example, you might think Orlando, FL is great place to visit and have a good time at but someone who lives there might think it's annoying with fireworks going off all the time. Someone else might think of times or events differently too. For example, you might think December is the best time of the year with all the holidays and family but someone else might think It's stressful to try and please everyone. If you're trying to make an important decision, try to get someone else point of view, it might help you.

Another reason you might want to get advice from someone else is they might have more experience in a topic than you. Someone might have been around different people more than you. This means they might have social skills than you or can talk in front of a crowd better than you. Someone might have been different or more places than you. This might make them better navigators or know more things about place than you. Someone else might know more than you by what they do or have done for living. For example, if you want to race cars when you grow up don't ask a plumber how to race cars, ask someone who has experience in that industry. If you need advice always to try to get it from someone who has more experience in the topic than you.

In my opinion the most important reason you should get advice from others is if they have more knowledge than you about the topic. Someone else might have known more about people and how that act more than you. Getting advice from them might help decide who to associate yourself with. Someone else might also have gone to school for learning about a specific topic. If you are also interested in the same topic they went to school for it will definitely help to get advice from them than it will be from anyone else. Someone else might have more information about a place than you. They can help you decide where to take a vacation to, what to do or where to stay on vacation. Getting advice from someone who has more knowledge on the topic will definitely help you make the right decision.

I think getting advice from other people is great. It can help you get a different Point of view on someone or something, they might have more experience or exposure to a topic than you, and they might just have more knowledge than you on the topic. So the next time you need advice make sure to consider what the people you are getting advice from have been through before in there life, it will affect the advice they give you. ",0,978
"Do you think you should get advice or opinions from yourself or others? How about finally getting an answer to your problem? Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice. It is better than just coming up with a better solution by yourself because it might never help you. We all need to talk to others and see what they think or want to say about it. If we listen to them, we will know what to do. People have different perspectives, have experience from the same situation, and knows how to help.

People have different perspectives of a choice or decision. Everybody has a different opinion since we are all different people. If you talk to multiple people, they all have different answers that can help your problem. One time, my friend was in a very hard situation and needed help. She asked for others on what to do. My friend got many answers on how to solve it. She didn't agree with some people, but it still helped her. After talking to a lot of people, my friend finally got an answer that she really liked. Finally, she felt so much better just because of talking to others. Another reason why we should seek multiple opinions is that some people have been in the same place as we are right now.

Some people have experience from the same situation as we might have. Many people might have been in the same place as us and knows what we should do. Studies have shown that over 60% of people worldwide has had the same problems as others. These people have dealt with the problem could help us. Reaching out to others that had the same problem will help you a lot. If you don't have many connections, maybe go to your school or neighborhood that could help. Even your friends might have been in the same position as you. Not everybody has the same exact problem, but there is a chance that maybe at least one person that you talk to has. Not only do people have experience from the situation, they also have knowledge on what is best.

The last reason why you should seek multiple opinions is that people know what to do based off wisdom. Many people are smart when it comes to choices or advice. They know what to do when a problem arises and could try to solve it. Many months ago, my sister was having a lot of stress and needed advice. She was in college which is hard and gives her a lot of work. My sister wanted to talk to others since they might have knowledge on it. She went to her friends, family members, and neighbors. She got a lot of advice but none of it worked. Some advice might not help, but you should still try to talk to people. Then, somebody gave her very long talk about stress and also gave her advice that actually helped. He didn't have experience from it but still knew what to do. My sister took his advice, and it made her feel much better. Although some advice didn't work, my sister kept on trying, and we should all do that. Many people know what to do and how to help.

All of us need to seek multiple opinions, so it can help us. We should always listen to others instead of ourselves. It will help us now and could help us later in the future. People have different opinions, have been in the same position as us, or just has knowledge of it. All of this can help somebody make a good choice.",0,979
"Summer is the time for most students to take a well-deserved break, and to relax until the next school year arrives. However, whether or not students should have homework during this time is very relevant, and many can't seem to find a consensus on the multiple aspects of that question. One part of said question is whether projects should be teacher-designed or student designed. There are many advantages and disadvantages in both viewpoints; however, one is more logical than the other. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would be more challenging and relevant than student-designed projects, effectively keeping students brains active over such a long break. Being teacher-designed also enables students to have a glimpse of what their future classes for that school year looks like, and enforces a more equal and realistic standard on the actual work itself.

One advantage of having teacher-designed projects would be the aspect of challenge and relevance that it would bring in opposition to a student-designed project. The teachers certainly have the credibility to assign work specific to their class, while many students (if given freedom to design their own project) may not have an idea of what to do or how to start. The challenge of potentially new material also helps keep their brains fresh, and sparks a sense of interest towards the class. Having teacher-designed projects is also useful in reviewing material for classes that may have more levels. For example, many students forget basic algebra that they learned a couple of years before taking Algebra II. Being given a project or homework from the teacher to guide them through re-learning some of that material would be beneficial not only for keeping their brains sharp, but for the helpful review for the class that comes with it.

Although one might say that it's unfair to do work over break and that the students should have the ability to choose the work they must do, it is less practical to operate in such a way. It is much more beneficial for the students in the long run to be able to keep their minds sharp over break, because it is easier to ease back into school and is helpful in becoming more intelligent overall. As a student myself, I have experienced summers where I have had summer homework, along with others where I have not. It was much easier to get back into school when I had summer homework to keep me occupied during the summer, and there was also a sense of accomplishment that came along with finishing it. Having the tangible assignment and deadline was also something that forced me to work on it and not procrastinate. On the flip side, if I hadn't had those certain restrictions it would have been much more difficult for me to work on and complete the project. Realistically, if projects were student-designed, it would also be much more difficult for teachers to accommodate every student individually and keep the criteria equal if they were to give them too much freedom. Therefore, it is just simply easier and more practical to have one guideline provided from the teacher.

Another advantage for the students is the fact that they would be able to have a glimpse of what the work for their future class entails, allowing them to have more flexibility in determining whether they would want to continue taking the class before the school year begins. It is generally easy to pick up on a teacher's way of teaching/the difficulty of the class when assigned summer projects directly from the teachers themselves. This allows students to have the option to switch to a higher or lower level if they find that the work doesn't match what they were expecting. If students were to design the project themselves, it would be much harder to pick up on how difficult the course actually was, which could be an unpleasant surprise at the beginning of the year.

Overall, the mere practicality of having teacher-designed projects outweighs the advantages of having student-designed projects. It is more beneficial for both the students and teachers as they come into the year feeling a little more prepared for the class. Looking forward, we should strive to implement (or re-implement) summer homework in schools because of the advantages of keeping a sharp mind and having more flexibility with the classes. However, we also must keep in mind that there should be certain restrictions on what the teachers can assign so that students can enjoy their break and not be overwhelmed or stressed by a sheer mass of work to complete. Generally, it is important to keep the minds of the students active in order to help them ease back into the school year easily. ",0,980
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home, so students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because school are not safe enough.

I think that students would benefit from being able to take online classes because schools are not able to protect students. School does not have enough security guards, and there is only one police officer in the whole school. Also, the security recording system has a bad video recording quality, and it is are not well located. For example someone stole my friends phone from her backpack, and some cameras recorded it, but you can not see who stole it because of the bad video quality.

Another reason I think students would benefit from online classes is because they will develop technological skills. Technological skills are very important now days, Most likely they are necessary to get a job or just in your everyday life.

Some say that normal classes are the best for student; however, I believe that online classes are better.

In conclusion, online classes are the best option because students develop technological skills, and schools are not safe enough.",0,981
"Humans have always been seen as superior to machines; however, the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to debate on whether machines have surpassed or will eventually surpass human minds. I disagree with the statement that the human mind will always be superior to machines. Machines have already surpassed us in many aspects, and there is no doubt that they will continue to do so in the future.

To begin with, machines are capable of performing complex calculations at a much faster rate than humans. For example, computers can solve complex equations or algorithms almost instantaneously, while it would take humans a significantly longer amount of time to solve the same equation. Furthermore, machines are also able to store massive amounts of data without the need for any physical memory storage, as opposed to humans whose memories are limited. This means that machines are able to access and process information much more quickly and accurately than humans.

In addition, machines are also able to perform a wider variety of tasks than humans. For instance, robots are able to perform many mundane and repetitive tasks, such as assembly line work, that would be difficult for humans to do for long periods of time. Furthermore, machines are also able to perform dangerous or difficult tasks that humans would not be able to do, such as deep sea exploration or space exploration. 

Another aspect in which machines are able to surpass humans is decision-making. Machines are able to analyze data and come to conclusions or decisions much faster than humans can. For instance, self-driving car technology is able to make decisions based on data from its environment much faster than a human driver would be able to. This technology has been proven to be much safer than human drivers and is likely to become increasingly commonplace in the future.

Finally, machines are also becoming increasingly advanced in their ability to simulate human interaction and behavior. For example, artificial intelligence systems are able to simulate human conversations and interact with people much more naturally than was previously possible. These systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are now able to hold more complex conversations and even understand emotions. 

In conclusion, while the human mind is still superior to machines in certain aspects, the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has allowed machines to surpass humans in many ways. They are able to perform complex calculations faster and more accurately, are able to perform more tasks, are more efficient at decision-making, and are able to simulate human behavior and interaction. As machines become increasingly more sophisticated in the future, it is likely that they will surpass humans in even more aspects. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that the human mind will always be superior to machines.

"Dear state senator, to the people voting is the most important part of politics. You out of all people speak politics, so you should understand. Keeping the electoral college would be many more great successful years in voting because of the certainty of outcome, it would take care of the swing and big states, and it avoids runoff elections.

Disputes over the outcomes of an electoral vote is possible. The winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds the popular vote. In other words in 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the votes while Rodney received only 51.3, and because almost all the states award winnertakesall even a slight chance of popularity could change the results. It is very unlikely for this to happen. Although there are many things wrong with the electoral college like making peoples votes not exactly count, it is something to figure out.

For the swing and big states, the voting is slightly different. The voters in the tossup states tend to pay more attention to the campaign than any other place. They really get into the whole campaign and really listen to all of what the competing candidates say and do. For the big states, the electoral college does them a favor and gives them more electoral candidates. It restores the weight in the balance that large states lose by virtue.

The electoral college does us a big favor by avoiding runoff situations, that could lead tome complicated situations. The runoff election occurs when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. These runoff elections cause a lot of pressure, and surely does complicate the presidential election.

In conclusion, staying with the electoral college process, it would maintain our problems of runoff elections, certainty of the outcome and the big and swing issues.",0,983

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated system that does not represent the will of the people. Furthermore, I urge you to support a change to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States.

The Electoral College was created in 1787 as a compromise between the small states and the large states. The small states wanted to have equal representation in the Electoral College, while the large states wanted their population to be taken into account. The compromise that was reached was to give each state a number of electors equal to the number of its senators and representatives in Congress.

This system has worked for over 200 years, but it is no longer fair or representative. The population of the states has changed dramatically since 1787, and the Electoral College no longer reflects the will of the people. In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became President. This is just one example of how the Electoral College can produce an outcome that is not in line with the will of the people.

There are a number of other problems with the Electoral College. It is a winner-take-all system, which means that a candidate can win the presidency with just 270 electoral votes, even if they did not receive a majority of the popular vote. This can lead to a situation where a candidate who is not supported by a majority of the people becomes President.

The Electoral College also makes it difficult for third-party candidates to win. A third-party candidate would need to win many states in order to get enough electoral votes to win the presidency. This is very difficult to do, and it is why third-party candidates rarely win any electoral votes.

I urge you to support a change to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. This would be a more fair and representative system that would reflect the will of the people.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Citizen",1,986
"Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is no different for individuals who are learning English as a second language (ESL). In fact, failure can be a valuable learning experience that can ultimately lead to success. In his famous speech, Sir Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement highlights the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of failure, which are essential qualities for ESL students to possess.

Research has shown that failure can have a significant impact on the success of ESL students. A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that ESL students who experienced more failures in their language learning were more likely to give up on their studies and ultimately fail to achieve their language goals. However, the study also found that students who were able to learn from their failures and use them as opportunities for growth were more likely to succeed in their language learning.

The role of failure in the pursuit of success is particularly important for ESL students because language learning is a complex process that requires a great deal of practice and repetition. Failure is a natural part of this process, and it is important for ESL students to learn how to handle it in a constructive way. This means being open to feedback, seeking out opportunities for improvement, and using mistakes as a way to learn and grow.

Churchill's statement on the role of failure in the pursuit of success is particularly relevant for ESL students because it emphasizes the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of challenges. ESL students who are able to bounce back from failures and continue to pursue their language goals are more likely to achieve success in the long run. This requires a mindset shift from seeing failure as a setback to seeing it as an opportunity for growth and learning.

In conclusion, failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is no different for individuals who are learning English as a second language. However, the impact of failure on the success of ESL students can be significant. ESL students who are able to learn from their failures and use them as opportunities for growth are more likely to succeed in their language learning.

"The use of this technology called the Facial Action Coding read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it will be very benefiting for the schools. The schools needed this technology to identify the emotional expressions of the students. Sometime things happen in school that the teachers don't know about; they don't know how their students are feeling. There are three benefiting about this technology. The Facial Action Coding System help the teachers identify the emotion of their students. The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy.

The first reason is the Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it helps the teachers identify the emotion of their student. It said in the article ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Some students in the school won't talk about how they are feeling in the classroom, and some of them would be scared to ask question when they are confused. The new technology would help the teachers so much on how to find out if their students are understanding the works they did in the classroom.

The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. Everybody in this world needs someone that could tell if they were happy or sad, so they would feel like someone is understanding them at lest. "" Beckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". These are the great things Beckman has classified that can help us and make us smile.

The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy. Sometimes we can tell that the person is happy or sad, but we can't tell it all the time. We can make the wrong assumption about a person by the look on their face.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. So we need the new technology to help to tell us about a person feeling.",0,988

In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around.  You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk.  It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependent on motor vehicles.  If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution.

It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to ""give up"" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house.  In Vauban, Germany, this ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area.  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walter, a mother of two and media trainer.  70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.  The town is not completely ""car free,"" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg.  Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way.

Smog is a big problem in Paris, France.  After several days of ""near-record pollution,"" Paris temporarily banned driving to clear the cities air.  About 4,000 drivers received a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine.  The fine worked and the cities' congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.  The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France.  The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared, and the band was lifted.",0,989
"## The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement is driven by a number of factors, including the desire to reduce air pollution, improve public health, and create more sustainable communities.

There are many potential advantages to limiting car usage. One advantage is that it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which can cause a number of health problems, including asthma, heart disease, and cancer. Reducing car usage can help to improve air quality and make our communities healthier places to live.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can improve public health. Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise, and they can also help to reduce stress and improve mental health. When people walk or bike instead of driving, they are also less likely to be involved in car accidents.

Limiting car usage can also create more sustainable communities. Cars take up a lot of space, and they contribute to urban sprawl. When people walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving, they can help to reduce the need for new roads and parking lots. This can free up space for other uses, such as parks, schools, and affordable housing.

There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to make it more difficult and expensive to drive. This can be done by increasing the cost of gasoline, tolls, and parking. Another way to limit car usage is to make it easier and more convenient to walk, bike, and take public transportation. This can be done by building more sidewalks and bike lanes, and by providing more public transportation options.

Limiting car usage can be a challenge, but it is also a worthwhile goal. By reducing air pollution, improving public health, and creating more sustainable communities, we can make our world a better place for everyone.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also have a number of economic benefits. For example, when people walk or bike instead of driving, they can save money on gas, parking, and car maintenance. They can also save time, as walking and biking are often faster than driving in congested areas. In addition, limiting car usage can help to revitalize downtown areas by making them more attractive to businesses and residents.

Overall, there are many potential advantages to limiting car usage. By making it more difficult and expensive to drive, and by making it easier and more convenient to walk, bike, and take public transportation, we can make our world a better place for everyone.",1,990
"Working at a local bakery has always appealed to me, and I believe that I am suited for the role on so many levels. Firstly, I have always loved experimenting with ingredients and recipes – something I think could be perfect for a bakery setting. This love of experimenting means that I am very open to learning new things and have a real enthusiasm for different flavors, styles, and methods.

I also think I would relish the opportunity to make new friends in the local community by working at a local bakery. Bakers and customers alike are an important part of any bakery, and I think it would be great to forge relationships with regulars and simply talk shop with like-minded bakers.

Finally, I believe I have the energy and enthusiasm required to successfully showcase this local bakery to potential employers. From working tirelessly to craft the perfect product, to thinking proactively about marketing strategies, I have confidence in my ability to take the bakery to a new level of success.

In conclusion, I am drawn to the idea of working in a local bakery and am confident I could integrate quickly into the role and make a positive impact.",1,991
"Dear Teacher,

I think the legalization of marijuana is a really important topic that people have been talking about a lot lately. Some people think it's a good idea, while others don't. In my essay, I'm going to argue for the legalization of marijuana and give some reasons why.

Firstly, I think it's important to say that marijuana is already being used by a lot of people, even though it's not legal. According to a survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 36 million people in the United States have used marijuana in the past year. That's a lot of people! By making it legal, the government can regulate the production and sale of marijuana, which would make it safer for people to use.

Secondly, legalizing marijuana could help reduce crime. Right now, a lot of criminal organizations make money from selling marijuana illegally. If marijuana were legal, these organizations wouldn't be able to make as much money from it, and that could help reduce crime. Additionally, law enforcement agencies could focus on more serious crimes instead of spending resources on investigating and prosecuting people for possessing small amounts of marijuana.

Thirdly, legalizing marijuana could also help people who are sick. Some people use marijuana for medical reasons, like to relieve pain or nausea. If marijuana were legal, it would be easier for these people to get the medicine they need. Doctors and scientists have found that marijuana can be effective in treating conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS, and multiple sclerosis.

Finally, I think it's important to say that legalizing marijuana wouldn't necessarily mean that more people would start using it. In fact, studies have shown that the number of people using marijuana doesn't necessarily go up when it's legalized. For example, in Colorado, where marijuana is legal, the number of people using it has actually stayed the same.

In conclusion, I think the legalization of marijuana is a good idea. It would make the drug safer, reduce crime, help sick people, and wouldn't necessarily lead to more people using it. I hope this essay helps show why legalizing marijuana is a good idea.

Sincerely,

"Dear, State Senator I would for you to change the way presidents get elected to the United States of America. The reason for this is because, it would be much easier for the president, it would be easier on the states who have racial problems, and states who might cheat.

To back up my argument, It would be much easier to abolish the electoral college. If the college was to be abolished then presidents themselves would be easily elected. Instead of electing 34 democratic electors. It would be fair to do that so that everything goes smoothly and better for everyone especially for presidents.

Next, it would go easier on states who have a bit of a racial issue. On some states it is difficult to get elected because of racial issues. For instance, in Arizona there is a huge racial problem there, and it would be difficult to elect different types of Democratic electors. Thus making it difficult for Arizona to elect a president. In other States it would also be the something, just voting for the president would be easier.

My last reason, to abolish the electoral college is because of some states who might cheat. During election, it is a difficult time because of every state wanting their president to one. That made the state would cheat the votes into elect those 34 democratic electors that will do anything to cheat. Another example, is in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose popular John F. Kennedy.

In Conclusion, the Electoral college needs to be abolished because it would be easier to vote for presidents, also it would be easier for states who have racial issues, and for states who are unfaithful.  ",0,993
"I believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I think that this is because they are too busy living their own lives and trying to find their own way in the world. Furthermore, I also think that they are not used to working in teams. Furthermore, I think that it is important for young people to get involved in their local communities and help out with things like cleaning, landscaping, and more. Furthermore, I think that this will make them more involved in their surroundings and make them better people.

Furthermore, I have some specific examples to back up my argument. For example, I have heard about young people who are not used to working in teams. They are usually the ones who do the most work and are the ones who are always last to leave the workstation. Because of this, they often do not get the credit they deserve. I have also heard about young people who do not know how to use the surrounding resources. They often end up using things that are not safe or that are not good for the environment. I think that it is important for young people to learn about the different things that they can do to help their local communities.

I think that young people today need to be more involved in their local communities. Furthermore, I think that this will make them better people and make them more involved in their surroundings. Furthermore, I also think that it is important for them to learn about the different things that they can do to help their local communities. This will help them to be more responsible and better citizens.

"While distance learning offers some benefits for students, I do not believe it can fully replace the traditional classroom experience. Some benefits of distance learning include increased flexibility, the ability to work at one's own pace, and avoiding the hassle of commuting to school each day. However, distance learning is lacking in important ways. 

One of the biggest drawbacks of distance learning is the reduced human interaction and sense of community that comes from attending school in person. Part of education is learning how to interact and collaborate with others. In a physical classroom, students can more easily ask questions, work together on projects, and form study groups. The social aspect of school plays an important role in a student's development. Distance learning makes meaningful socializing and teamwork more difficult.

Additionally, staying focused and engaged can be a challenge for many students when learning from home without face-to-face guidance from a teacher. It is all too easy to become distracted by electronics, household chores, or other responsibilities when attending class remotely rather than from a dedicated classroom. Some students may also find it difficult to self-motivate without the structure and accountability provided by in-person lessons. This lack of direct oversight could lead to gaps in learning if students do not stay on top of their studies independently. 

While distance learning has its benefits, high school students in particular would benefit more from the traditional classroom experience overall. The social interaction, accountability, and engagement that come from in-person instruction are important factors for students' development and academic success. Distance learning should not fully replace traditional schooling but could complement it to provide some increased flexibility in limited cases when necessary. For most students, attending classes at school on a regular basis would likely lead to better long-term outcomes.",1,995
"Phones and Driving

Having a cellphone when driving is dangerous. Dangerous for you and the people around you. Most people lives are taken each and every day by a simple act called ""Careless Driving"". The act of texting and has come across from this new generation.

Statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone and at least 341000 involved text messaging.

Texting while driving is worse than talking while driving. Talking while driving isn't as bad because your focused on the road but at the same time, you're trying to listen to someone else's conversation, and you try to get over, and you think your focused, and you're not then boom a car crash. Texting while driving as to be the worst thing ever and causes more effects and injuries. Texting while driving you have look down at your phone instead of it being in front of you the boom when you rise back up to see the road, you're on the other side of or about to hit a car.

Statistics show that 37,461 lives were lost on U.S. roads in 2016 an increase of 5.6% from 2015 until 2017. Also, in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers. So, it seems that texting while driving is way dangerous then talking while driving its many proving facts you get kilt faster while texting and driving.

They have cars today that can stop people from having cellphones in their hand. Bluetooth is more optional and more used in high classed cars for more protection, but still can cause accidents. There are our laws today that can send you to jail containing the driving and texting which is if you don't have a car that has Bluetooth or a stand for your phone then you're not able to use it and your will get a ticket.

To conclude this please don't text and drive if it's not meant to do. You can save a lot of lives mostly yours. More lives are saved every day because its less wreck less drivers and more safety.  ",0,996
"Do you want to take care of horses, young cows, and mules? Well if you do, Join the Seagoing Cowboys in taking our adventure OT help people and places bombed in World War ll.

When Luke and Don were traveling overseas in the Seagoing Cowboys, They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, Headed for Greece. The cargo was 335 horses and enough oats to feed all the horses.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18, Which back then meant that Luke could be drafted for military service.

A couple of years later he was discharged, Luke had made nine trips, The most of any Seagoing Cowboy ever. The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable experience for Luke being a small town boy. Before helping anyone he had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But Luke also got to see the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Itlay.

Luke also toured at the evacuated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern United States and a month to China.

"I am personally for the development of these cars. Driverless cars can bring so much to the world. Impaired driving accidents would decline in numbers because of these cars. One of the goals of driverless cars is to eventually have taxis from driverless cars and use less fuel as they would be more accessible than buses. These cars would also provide safety to the elderly. Once these cars are produced at large rates it will change everything.

Impaired driving is one of the most talked topic on the news as they are the cause of many deaths all through the world. Driverless cars could decrease the amount of deaths from impaired driving as the intoxicated driver could select an option to tell the car that he is unable to drive. The car could then safely take them home without the risk of anyone losing their lives. Other forms of impaired driving exist such as texting. Reducing the amount of impaired driving deaths could help many people.

The cofounder of Google envisions a world where these cars could function as taxis and lower fuel usage. Big cities like New York City could benefit from this as they have hundreds of taxis throughout the city. Lowering fuel usage in just New York City would save not only fuel but also help the environment. In smaller cities everyone would not need a car. They would call for a taxi and just go where ever they need to go.

Everyday people always encounter elderly drivers who just seem a little too oblivious. Special cars with some sort of elderly setting could make driving safer for them. Sometimes an elderly person just wants to get out of the house and drive around. Well these cars would enable them to do this safely. This way they wouldn't run a red light or ignore a stop sign and potentially risk someone's life.

In conclusion mass production of driverless cars would benefit thousands of people. No one would be in risk of their life taken because someone made a choice to drive while impaired. Lower fuel usage would help our environment. Elderly people could be safer on the roads. This technology will help many for different reasons and will make roads a safe place for everyone.",0,998
"Isn't technology just great? Through time technology has been advancing, and it's just getting better, but is it minimizing our connections with the human contact? I believe It's had a good positive effect on peoples lives. See it this way, technology helps us so much like buildings cars and airplanes, technology has taken over restaurants in such a way that you no longer have to tip! Technology and stores do mix and its just speeding up the process.

Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! By using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, that's incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative it's all online no need of customer service. Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. Org get the piece you need the next day. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize.

Who would've known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members, but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your fingertips. While your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing something's else unless called by a customer. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! Thanks to technology nowadays?

Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? I have and It was devastating to watch! Or have you witnessed a wrong change? Things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money. That's why they invented self-checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. Just scan and go! Sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Yes they'll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. Is it weird not seeing an employee in the cash register? Yes but you'll get use to it as time continues.

Having technology in our side has made us better and has lightened our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives. How stressful would it be for Ford Junior to hire millions of workers, and finish one car every five hours? Or opening up a restaurant and hire twenty workers who are rude, lazy to their customers? And last but certainly not least, Walmart having hundreds of workers who take forever to scan and pack your items. All of this would stink if we wouldn't have such great technology in our hands.",0,999
