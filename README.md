# MLOps DTU Course 02476 - Detecting AI Generated Text 

##### Students: 
Christian Raasteen s204148 - Christoffer Wejendorp s204090 - Jasmin Thari s204155 - Johanne Franck s204088

##### Goal of project: 
The goal of the project is to use natural language processing to solve a binary classification task to detect whether a text is AI generated or not. See our deployed model here: <https://predicter-qkns26jbea-ew.a.run.app/>

##### Framework: 
As we are working with Natural Language Processing (NLP), we will use the [Transformers framework](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from the Huggingface group. As a starting point we intend to use one of the many pretrained models in the Framework on our data and then further improve the model performance.

##### Data: 
We will be using the [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data) that consists of 1375 essays written by students. They are sorted into two topics: "Car-free cities" and "Does the electoral college work?" and are written in response to a prompt. 
We augment the data set with 1375 essays generated by the openAI API. The essays are written in response to the same prompts as the student essays. We furthermore augmented the data by adding data from this [daigt-dataset]<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-proper-train-dataset>

The final data set contains the following columns
* text - The essay text itself.
* label - Whether the essay was written by a student (0) or generated by the AI(1).

##### Model: 
We will be using a pre-trained [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert) model (present in the Transformers library for Huggingface) for the NLP classification task. DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base. It has 40% less parameters than bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERT’s performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark.

##### Checklist
In this project we focus on keeping a good project structure and make our project reproducible. In order to obtain this, we will utilize tools as cookiecutter for organised document structure, hydra for configurating hyperparameters, docker for reproducibility as well as dvc for data handling.  

Please see the [checklist.md](https://github.com/ChrisRawstone/Detecting_AI_Generated_Text/blob/develop/checklist.md) for what learning objectives the project fulfills.
