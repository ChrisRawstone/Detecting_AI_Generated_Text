# MLOps DTU Course 02476 - Detecting AI Generated Text 

##### Students: 
Christian Raasteen s204148 - Christoffer Wejendorp s204090 - Jasmin Thari s204155 - Johanne Franck s204088

##### Goal of project: 
The goal of the project is to use natural language processing to solve a binary classification task to detecting AI generated text. We are 

##### Framework: 
As we are working with NLP, we will use the [Transformers framework](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from the Huggingface group. As a starting point we intend to use one of the many pretrained models in the Framework on our data and then further improve the model performance.

##### Data:  
We will be using the [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data). The data consists of 1375 esssays written by students. Initially, we will simply augment the data set by using the openAI api




 The data is available in .csv format (4.43 MB).  The training set is then augmented by using       

Each row in the dataset contains:

* id - A unique identifier for each essay.
* prompt_id - Identifies the prompt the essay was written in response to.
* text - The essay text itself.
* generated - Whether the essay was written by a student (0) or generated by an LLM (1). This field is the target and is not present in test_essays.csv.

##### Model: 
We will be using a pre-trained DistilBERT model (present in the Transformers library for Huggingface) for the NLP classification task. DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base. It has 40% less parameters than bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERT’s performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark.

##### Checklist
In this project we focus on keeping a good project structure and make our project reproducible. In order to obtain this, we will utilize tools as cookiecutter for organised document structure, docker for reproducibility as well as dvc for data handling (even though the data size is small).  

Please see the [checklist.md](https://github.com/ChrisRawstone/Detecting_AI_Generated_Text/checklist.md) for what learning objectives the project fulfills.
