"I'm a scientist at NASA and me and a group of scientist have been discussing the face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. While Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible lading sites of his sister ship Viking 2. He had spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Viking 1 snapped a photo of it and sent it to the Jet Propulsion lab.

A few days later the NASA unveiled the image for all to see. Scientist discoverd that the face was formed by a shadow giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Over the past years scientist believe it would attract more attention to Mars. It certainly did! The famous face on mars became a pop icon all over the world. It stared in many things like hollywood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows as well.

After the big news that the face was a success scientist soon found out that other scientist believe it was an alien artiract. Jim Garvin explained that they felt this was important to taxpayers. He also photographed the face as soon as he could get a good shot at it.

On april 5, 1998 a group of

Mars Global Surveyor flew to mars and took ten more photos, That were sharper then what the Viking 1 took. Thousands of people have been waiting for the images to be posted on the website JPL. Soon after the photos were taken Mars global Surveyor have posted the images there wern't actually alien monument after all.

Many people wern't satisfied with the information that has came back to them including Garvin. Garvin stills believe that the faces that were found were yet to be alien artifacts. Garvin wants them to retake the pictures and do the research again. The Mars Global Surveyor does it agian and they retake the pictures more clearly. Scientist has come to an conclusion the the faces that were found on Mars is not yet found.                ",0
"Dear Principal,

I agree with policy 1 because you can interact with your peers more and talk about hanging out after school or talk about something private. I agree with number 1 again because if your having a bad day let that friend know by texting them. I also agree with them being turned off because people could cheat on tests and stuff, but if someone comes to the school with a gun you have your phone to call the police or your parents for help.

Like our school we have to have them off all day until we get outside, when most people have them on anyway. If you get caught with your hone here they take it for two school days then your parents have to come and get it. I think we should be able to have our phones during school hours in study halls or free time because we can get to know our peers more, which is good for our social life, so your don't die alone or go being depressed.

I hope you read this letter and enjoyed this letter. Thank you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that attending a regular school is much more beneficial than attending classes from home through online or video conferencing. While some students may prefer online classes due to convenience and flexibility, I argue that the social and academic benefits of attending a regular school outweigh these advantages.

One of the most significant advantages of attending a regular school is the opportunity to interact with other students face-to-face. This interaction allows for the development of social skills and the building of meaningful relationships with peers. In online classes, students may miss out on these opportunities and struggle to develop social skills that are essential for success in the future.

Additionally, attending a regular school provides students with a structured environment that can help them stay organized and motivated. In online classes, students may struggle with procrastination and lack of accountability, which can negatively impact their academic performance. A regular school setting provides a consistent schedule and routine that can help students stay on track and achieve their academic goals.

Furthermore, attending a regular school provides students with access to resources and support that may not be available through online or video conferencing. For example, students may have access to tutoring services, counseling, and extracurricular activities that can help them succeed academically and personally. These resources can be invaluable in helping students overcome challenges and achieve their full potential.

However, I understand that some students may prefer online classes due to convenience and flexibility. For example, students who have busy schedules or live far from a school may find online classes to be a more convenient option. Additionally, some students may prefer the flexibility of online classes, allowing them to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.

In conclusion, while online classes may have some advantages, attending a regular school provides students with numerous benefits that are essential for their academic and personal success. The opportunity to interact with other students face-to-face, a structured environment, access to resources and support, and the development of social skills are all advantages of attending a regular school that cannot be replicated through online or video conferencing. While some students may prefer online classes, I believe that attending a regular school is ultimately the best option for most students.",1
"Working with a group has several distinct advantages. Group members can help to share the workload, bring different skill sets and perspectives to the project, and may even offer encouragement and support. On the other hand, working alone has its own advantages as well, as it allows for quicker decision making, fewer delays, and complete autonomy over the project. 

However, a group experience also carries some distinct disadvantages. Projects can be complicated by conflicting opinions and ideas, communication issues, and the challenge of managing a cohesive team. In contrast, working alone carries the risk of project stagnation, limited resources, and a greater challenge in staying motivated.

Overall, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the project and the team. Working with a group may be a better fit when tackling a complicated project, while a small project may be best suited for working alone. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the project goals and the individuals involved.",1
"Yes, the use of Facial Action Codying Stystem would be very useful for students in the classroom. Not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in an another way. Along with this, this technology could introduce a lot more job intrest, hobby intrest, or just pure intrest among students. Lastly, this technology would be beneficial to students because it would give us a reason to be taught about the science of emotion, we could learn and go more into depth about our basic human body and mind and how easy emotions can show.

This technology can change lessons for kids who aren't understanding, or are just completley bored of the material being shown. This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. From paragraph 6 the author stated, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Ending the conversation with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work.

Secondly, the FACS can show students a different range of technology that is fairly new. It could show some kids something they may be passionate for but never knew of, it could be a possible job intrest, a new hobby interest, anything at all. The people using this technology are doing so many things, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;"" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements."" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.

Lastly, having this technology in our school would give us a reason to talk about the basic science of emotion. We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8. Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers.

Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct. This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about. ",0
"George Washington once said, “I have no other view than to improve our success by keeping the utmost vigilance…and resolving never to be discouraged.” This simple yet profound adage captures the concept of ""failure to failure equals success"", which implies that success is achieved through a series of failures. Indeed, many successful people from various realms of life have found success despite failing multiple times. 

Take for example the story of media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who was once fired from a local news station for being ""unfit for television"". This an inflection point for Oprah, who had failed and was ready to give up, but decided to keep pushing and eventually became an influential figure in the world of media and entertainment. Her mantra became, “Turn your wounds into wisdom.” 

These stories show us that success is achievable even after multiple failures. Rather than giving in to doubt and despair, people can find strength and perseverance to continue trying until success is achieved. As Winston Churchill famously said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”",1
"Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. Every parents wants to see them successes in life, and be happy, but what they don't understand is how much pressure and anxiety they put on their child. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture.

Do you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you don't even like and want. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . But Generic_Name's family didn't understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesn't want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. That's why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not.

dreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didn't let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Always stay strong and never give up.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. In today's world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and that's where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. We should be doing the thing we love and dreamed of no one has the right to tell you otherwise. You should never change yourself to make others happy or to show them you care about them, because if they really care about you they will accepted you for you.

Changing yourself for other just so could show them your carrying, perfect, and happy is not love. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. Generic_Name's mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers'. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Name's mom never agree with him she told him"" you have to study music and that's that."" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him"" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you don't have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future"". Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didn't want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back.

In the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment.",0
" The summer break is an essential opportunity for students to take a break from the rigors of the school year and recharge their batteries. While some educators may argue that the summer is too long and that students should have a year-round school schedule, I believe that a long summer break is crucial for students' academic success and personal growth.

Firstly, a long summer break allows students to take a break from the academic grind and spend some quality time with their families. This time can be used to catch up on any missed time with loved ones and to create new memories together. Furthermore, spending time with family can provide students with valuable advice and support that can help them achieve their academic goals. For example, students who spend time with their families discussing their school year are more likely to be motivated and have a clear goal for the next school year.

Secondly, a long summer break can provide students with the opportunity to participate in various positive activities outside of the classroom. This can include sports, music, art, or other extracurricular activities that can help students develop new skills and interests. These experiences can also provide students with a sense of accomplishment and boost their confidence, which can translate into academic success in the classroom.

Finally, a long summer break can provide students with the time to review their school year and identify areas where they need to improve. This can include catching up on missed work, studying for upcoming tests or exams, or seeking out additional help from teachers or tutors. By taking the time to reflect on their academic performance, students can set goals for themselves and work towards achieving them in the upcoming school year.

In conclusion, while some educators may argue that a long summer break is too long, I believe that it is an essential opportunity for students to recharge and prepare for the upcoming school year. By spending time with their families, participating in positive activities, and reviewing their academic performance, students can set themselves up for success in the classroom and beyond.",1
"Sports and activities. At this point in our lives, who doesn't really do one? Doing things like these keep our minds, and our body's active. It helps keeps us stay focused on our weight, grades, and the way we act. If our principle wanted to move the grade average to a B to play sports, I think that there would be a lot of chaos. Our schools practically revolve around our work, our sports, and our other activities. We are all on the same team no matter who you root for, it's still what we enjoy doing.

If you had to have the grade average of a B to play in any activities, i don't know what would happen. Maybe it could help people bring their grades up, or maybe it wouldn't. You never know til you try something, so it's always hard just to guess. I would go against the grade average being moved up, because I don't think it would really help. Sports or activities are always your choice, whether you want to play or not. Whether you should shoot, kick, jump, tackle, or just close your eyes. It's your choice, and no one else can change that for you.

I also think that if they moved it up, many people would just stop playing. If you don't understand a school subject, and yet you can still pass I think that it's okay. I mean, yes you would want to be able to understand things a whole lot better, but if they're not going to help you in the future what's the point? Getting good grades is a fantastic thing, but if you really want something it all comes down to you. It's your choice to follow your heart and do what you want to do, or to do what's best for you.

Whether you're for, or against something it's still your choice to do what you want. Making choices can be tough, but you can always try to find something out. That's why I would be against moving the grade average up to a B. I believe that it could be a good thing, or a bad thing but you'll never know til you try. Those are my reasons to be against it, but no matter what it's still passing. In the end, it will always come down to your choice, and what's best for you.",0
"It is a good idea to join the Seagoing Cowboys because, it is a good process of learning how to take care and train horses, cows, and mules, and other animals that suffered in the ruins doing the war, and provide food supplies for the animals.

You also get to go places you never seen before like, in the passage it said that Luke explored Venice, Italy. It is very fun too because, you get to also play fun sports like tennis, volleyball games, and table tennis tournaments. It takes a lot of hardwork to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

"Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  I'm so excited to write this essay about cell phones in classrooms.  I know, I know, some people might think it's, like, super obvious, but I gotta share my thoughts. 🤷‍♀️

First of all, let's talk about the advantages of allowing cell phones in classrooms.  One thing is, it's super convenient for teachers to communicate with students during class. Like, if a student is absent or needs help, they can just send a quick message. It's also super helpful for students who have learning disabilities or need extra support. They can use their phones to look up information or take notes, which can help them stay focused and on track. 📱🧠

But,  there are also some pretty big disadvantages. For one thing, it can be super distracting for other students.  Like, if someone is constantly checking their phone during class, it can be really annoying and take away from the learning experience. And, , it can be hard for teachers to keep track of who's on their phone and who's not. It's like, how do they know if someone's just scrolling through Instagram instead of paying attention? 🤷‍♀️

Personally, , I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.  Like, think about it, if we can use our phones to help us learn, why not? It's like, the future of education and stuff. 🤖 Plus, it's not like we're gonna be on our phones the whole time.  We'll still pay attention and stuff. Just, you know, sometimes we might need to look something up real quick. 😅

I mean, , there are already so many apps and websites that can help us learn stuff. Like, Khan Academy and Duolingo are super helpful for math and language learning.  And, *writes down",1
"Dear principal,

I think you should make it a requirement to all students to provide at least 100 hours of community service because if we were all to go downtown and pick up a full large bag of garbage from the streets our town would be much more cleaner and nicer.

I also think it would be a good idea to visit the elderly a couple times and maybe read to them or play a board game with them.

If the elderly don't have anyone to talk to or play with the last years of their life they` re going to die sad and lonely.

What we can also do is have people and students walked around the school and look for trash then we can have a cleaner school.

And I think you should make it a grade to do because if students think they can stay home and do nothing while other student go and do the work then they` re wrong.

Imagine if no one cleaned the streets and just left them like that with McDonald and Burger King wrappers on the ground.

the streets would look like a total wasteland and junkyard all pilled with millions of peoples trash.

If we live in them don't you think it` s our responsibility to clean them and take care of them.

If students walk the streets and go to the stores and buy candy and food then leave the trash on the ground instead of taking two steps the garbage can in front of you.

I also think we should put garbage cans out on every block so people can put their garbage into.

This is why you should make it a requirement to serve at least 100 hours of community service.

"Driverless cars

You may think that driverless cars are good but I think that driverless cars are senseless I wouldnt want that I would want to drive my car myself. I waited a long time to get my driving license and drive my own car but no they had to come up with the diverless car and make all the other cars seem useless. Im going to figure out what makes this car so good, and see if would come in handy because its alot of people are craveing this car.

This car seem so crazy because what if my car startes to act all crazy and catch on fire what am i going to do im waisted my money and time on that car and it would be hard to buy a new one . I think we should all this stick with the cars we are use to. Because when you get this car you wont know what to do, and most people dont read manual to cars they just say they figure it out on their own. Once they try that they end up messing something up and having to spend more money on getting it fixed.

The car may come in handy because they have senseors even though sensors are nothing new they help stop the car like when the person driving the car hits the brake the brake sensors each wheel to ruduce speed so the human can gain controll over his or her car again. It can help older people to like when they arent suppose to be driving. This car is like having a driving assistant. They dont wont need to drive the car would drive by its self that would be good for some old people that like to get out a lot.

Most drivers focus on keeping the riders saft but it this car is a smart car so if they had a accident the car can prevent it from happening. In some staes this car is not saft for people to drive so the car comapany must prove that the car is saft.

if some one gets injured in that car should it be the manufacturer fault or should it be the drivers fault i think that it should be the manufacturer fault because they built they car and i should feel saft I it.

Overall i dont that this car is smart to build because i wouldnt feel saft in it.

I think they should come up with another idea for a car because if a lot of people get hurt it that car they might end up bankrupt and sewd so bad that they would have to close down there shop and just start their retirement. This car seem very senseless and I wouldnt buy it.   ",0
"Libraries have been a vital part of our society for centuries, serving as a hub for knowledge and learning. However, with the advent of the digital age, the role of libraries has come under scrutiny. Some argue that libraries are no longer necessary, while others believe they are more important than ever. In this essay, I will argue for the continued importance of libraries, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, libraries provide a free and accessible source of information. With the rise of the internet, it may seem that information is readily available to everyone. However, not everyone has access to the internet or the skills to navigate it effectively. Libraries offer a space where people can access information without the need for a computer or internet connection. Additionally, libraries often have resources that are not available online, such as rare books, archives, and special collections. These resources are invaluable for researchers, students, and anyone looking to expand their knowledge.

Secondly, libraries are a vital source of community engagement. They offer a space for people to come together and learn from one another. Libraries often host events, workshops, and programs that cater to people of all ages, backgrounds, and interests. These events promote literacy, creativity, and social cohesion, fostering a sense of community and belonging. For example, my local library hosts a weekly book club, where members can discuss books and share their thoughts and opinions. This not only promotes literacy but also provides a platform for people to connect and make new friends.

Thirdly, libraries are essential for supporting education. They provide students with access to resources and materials that are often not available at school or home. Libraries also offer study spaces, quiet areas, and research assistance, all of which are critical for students looking to succeed. Furthermore, libraries often provide access to digital resources, such as online databases and e-books, which can be accessed remotely. This means that students can access information and resources from anywhere, at any time, making it easier for them to learn and succeed.

Finally, libraries are adapting to the digital age by embracing technology and innovation. Many libraries now offer e-books, audiobooks, and digital media, allowing people to access information in a format that suits them. Libraries are also using technology to improve accessibility, with tools such as text-to-speech software and screen readers. This means that people with disabilities can access information more easily, making libraries more inclusive and accessible.

In conclusion, libraries are just as important in the digital age as they have always been. They provide a free and accessible source of information, promote community engagement, support education, and are adapting to technology and innovation. While some may argue that libraries are no longer necessary, the evidence suggests that they are more important than ever. By continuing to support and invest in libraries, we can ensure that they continue to serve as a vital hub for knowledge and learning for generations to come.",1
"When the school year ends most students are just exited to know that they don't have to learn, knowing they can just relax, hang out with friends, or party. On the other hand, isn't this just holding them back in their learning process? Shouldn't they do some type of project that will allow them to exercise the mind and keep them learning? Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven't completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals . Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student?

Students are very lazy when they start to get closer to summer and to the break, they don't want to deal with the stress of the school. Having a project over the summer is the last thing that a student wants to do, so if they have the option of choosing what to do they will always chose something that isn't going to challenge them in anyway and will chose to do a easy topic that they can get done fast, that they already know, or that they have done before. For students summer is supposed to be the break from school and going out and having fun with friends and family, having vacations, and having a project to do over the summer break isn't really a break anymore. Summer break is more of an excuse for students to have fun and not worry about anything, but if you put a project for them to do they understand that they have to get it done while having a pretty long time to do it right, others will leave it for last minute. However this over the break project gives students about 2 months to get it done without having to be stressed, being able to do it at their own pace. That is why teachers assign the different project to each student, because they want the student to succeed by giving them something that, as a teacher, they know what they outcome would or could be and for the student to be challenged, yet doing something they can comprehend.

Even though students are the ones doing the project, teachers are the ones who understand the subjects that student should be learning. If you let a student pick a subject to work on over the summer, he could chose something very unnecessary that would have no impact in the students growth as an intellectual, he could say he is doing a science project that would ask how many hours he can play a video game before he gets hungry and eats food, or before he has to go to the bathroom. Teachers who got to know and understand their students throughout the year would know what they could be interested in and would work on during the summer. For students to be interested in something they want to understand how it works and find it fun to do. In order for students to not slack off and procrastinate they must find it interesting to them or they wont work on it. That is another thing that teachers must considered when giving out the projects that their students must do over the summer, if teachers assign the same project to everyone, many of them can get such projects done fairly quickly and not challenge them at all, having it done so soon they didn't learn anything for the project, or having all of them do the same project would just have them copy each other. Having teachers know their students strengths and their weaknesses, can help the teacher determine what project the student can work on that they will enjoy doing and will challenge them, helping them learn all at the same time.

All teachers want for their students is for them to be successful, in order for them to achieve such success they need to understand and go though the challenges that they have to face and the failures they must grow from in order for them to grow their knowledge as an individual. During the summer break, students benefit from having a project that can help them keep the knowledge they gained though out the school year, and not having to be shocked back into the next school year when they come back and have to re-learn stuff from the previous year that they may have forgotten, after that they can finally move forward and learn new things. The teachers give out this project for the whole purpose that given project helps students move forward, they assigned the project to the individual students knowing what would help them grow without having the summer break erasing everything they learned the previous year. ",0

"Do you feel that it is safe for someone to have their phone while driving? I believe that that there are reasons why you should and shouldn't be able to have your phone while driving. For example one of the reasons i believe that driving and being on your phone is dangerous is that many accidents can be caused. By that i mean when being on your phone you have no time to pay attention to the road. When driving your attention should be focused on the road at all times when looking down on your phone you can't tell who or what is coming at you, which is a easier way to cause you and or someone else to be injured.

Another reason i believe that it is dangerous for you to be on your phone and driving is because this is now another way to get arrested. By this i mean now if you're riding with your phone in sight the police is liable to arrest you. By doing this you're risking your freedom. Not only are you risking your freedom you're also putting others in harms way. By this i mean what if someone is walking in the cross walk and you happen to be on your phone and accidentally hit someone then not only is that more charges but that's also you injuring an innocent bystander.

There are also good reasons why you should be able to have your phone while driving. For example when going to a place and not knowing the directions your phone has a built in navigation system to help you get there. You don't always have to have your phone in your hand you can buy the stand where your phone can sit on that way you can see both your phone and the road.

So it isn't always bad having your phone while driving.

Another good reason to have your phone while driving is because what if there is an emergency and that is the only way someone can contact you, you don't have to hold your phone you can always get Bluetooth and or wireless headphones. By doing this you are preventing accidents from happening and your also preventing yourself and or anyone else from being in danger. Not only that but you are also able to focus on both the road and the situation that may be happening.

These are the reasons why i believe that having your phone while driving is both a good and bad thing. There are many more reasons why but these are my main three. By stating these i hope that people take caution while using there phones while driving. Now that reasons are listed i hope that people look out for themselves as well as others.         ",0
"Hello, Principal my name is STUDENT_NAME and i recommend that students should take position in which being required to perform community service.

I think students should perform Community Service why because it will help not only us the kids of the future but others as well and if they see us helping out the community then they would try to do the same as well. Community Service is very important to our environment if we don't keep it clean then who will, that's why we need to take a step ahead and put what people say about us helping out the community in the trash , they will try to join us one day . The specific matter is to teach our environment that we can stay clean such as not littering , recycling, and Community Services for a good purpose.

Sometimes i see people my age doing Community Services and mainly because the stole something from a warehouse or store or fail to go to court . Us as young people need to teach each other not to fall because if we do were going to fall in a hole that we cant get out of , when we could dig that hole for a community pool or basketball court or something to keep us in a educated service.

Community Service will change the way other people look at us , if someone came down here from Boston they would wont to turn back around because of how we treat our community but if we had a clean and neat environment they would enjoy staying down here for a couple of weeks or even longer.

This is what i recommend to students being positioned and taken part of Community Services.",0
"Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be required to take part in community service.

It is a great way to connect yourself with your community and help out others who are less fortunate than you or the environment.

As an eighth grader, I take part in tutoring some of the younger sixth graders at my school.

I think of this as community service because I do not get paid for these actions.

Also, it is community service because I am helping some of the younger children at my school understand what they are learning better.

Some students might not want to take part in the community service at first.

They might be reluctant to try.

After beginning the process, those certain students might realize that by taking part in community service, you can learn more about yourself as well as the environment and others around you.

The students who at first did not want to take part in the community service, might come to realize that they enjoy helping others and from doing so, benefit personally.

An issue with requiring all students to perform in community service is the time commitment.

Some busy students might decide that community service is not worth their time when they could be doing things that directly benefit themselves.

For example, they might rather spend time with their friends than spend time with children in a homeless shelter.

I think it is important that you understand that these students might take more time to convince to take part in your community service than others.

You should not simply tell them to do the community service because they are required to but you should explain to them why it is so important and you have decided to put emphasis on it.

I think that it is important for everyone to take part in making this world a better place.

Community service is one way to get people to contribute to that.

Students should show that they have a say and have their own individual rights.

By helping others or the environment around you, students can show that they can change this world, one little step at a time.

Community service could be that first little step.

I find it very important for all students to take part in community service some time in their life.

I think by making it a requirement for the students that attend our school, everyone will find that community service helps to better understand yourself as well as others.

It is a great opportunity that we should all take advantage of.

Sincerely,

Your student",0
"Not everyone can do things without any help. Some people need others to support them. When you make difficult choices, you always want advice before it actually happens. Sometimes people aren't sure of themselves, and they might not think that only one person is trustworthy enough. People talk to more than one person for advice because they want to make a better choice. They want to hear what other people have experienced, their personal feelings about the situation, the pros and cons, how they view everything, so they don't feel anxious about it as much. No one wants to do something when they don't know what will come out of it, and not only one person can help them. Sometimes people just need more assurance before they do something big, and talking to more people helps them a lot more than one person can alone. People talk to more than one person because they want their choice to be the best and most beneficial choice no matter what.

Everyone has lived a different life, whether you were rich or poor, healthy or ill, no one has lived the same life as another. When you need help making a choice, you talk to people because they haven't lived exactly like you. They haven't lived exactly like anyone. I would need to know what other people have spectated or experienced when they have had to make a choice similar to mine because I don't want one person to help. I want more people to help advise me because they might have experienced more than I have. You get more wisdom to make your choice when you hear more experiences. They view things differently than someone else. Getting more than one opinion makes sure you don't hear just point of view. It opens your eyes to many other things instead of being one-sided. Everyone has experienced different things in their lives, so not a single opinion alone will be correct. You would need many experiences to truly know what can happen from your choice.

People have anxiety when making hard choices. They always think of all the things that could go wrong in the process. Talking to one person doesn't always help, some people might think their opinion isn't enough. I don't always trust my opinion or my judgment. I need others to make me feel safe and secure, so that I can really trust what I'm doing. I don't want to make a choice when I'm anxious because then I will regret it later. I know I wouldn't be in the right mindset to make a choice if I'm anxious, so talking to more than one person would relieve most of my stress and anxiety. If you talk to only one person, you only get one of everything. You don't know everything that might happen, so you don't really know if you're doing the best thing. No one should make a choice when they are not sure about it. They should always feel that their choice was the best that they could have done. When you talk to more than one person, you know more the possible outcomes. You don't think about everything that can go wrong, but instead you think about all the things that you're doing right. You make your choice in the best mindset when you're not anxious.

You always want to know the pros and cons of things, but it is normally hard to find them on your own. Talking to one person doesn't always help because they are also just one person. Putting multiple minds together to think of pros and cons will give spectacular outcomes. Sometimes I need all the facts, pros, and cons. My mind and others needs help to come up with these pros and cons because we have a lot on our minds already about making the decision itself. We would be preparing to actually do it. I know I wouldn't be able to do it all on my own. I know I would need multiple people to help me because sometimes people aren't feeling their best. They might not be able to help you find all the pros and cons, but bringing together multiple people ensures that you get the facts you want. I wouldn't want to make a choice without knowing the cons of it. I want to know all the bad things that might happen even if it's for the best so that I can prepare for it. You would also get more detailed and possibly more profound pros and cons. You get all the facts when you work with more people, because more minds means more knowledge.

Everyone needs a support system, whether it's family or friends. When you ask for advice, you go to multiple people for help. You ask them for things to help you make your choice. I want people behind me to help me after I make my choice. If the choice knocks me down in any way, I want people to be there to support me. If I talk to multiple people, I know all of those people will help me if I fall. No one wants to feel alone after their choice. I would only make a tough choice if I was certain I had at least one person to help me. If I talked to more than one person, I know at least one of them will be able to support me because they helped me. They know what I was going through when I was making this choice. Talking to more than one person ensures that you have at least one person to fall back on after you made your choice.

No one knows if they're doing the right thing. Sometimes they don't trust them self, sometimes they're too anxious, and sometimes they just need more people to support them. Talking to more people helps you make the best choice. You know what you're doing is for the best. You know that you heard what might happen, you've seen things through other points of view, you aren't anxious when you make your choice, and you know people have your back. Talking to more people helps you make a better choice because no one can do everything alone. If you talk to more people, you trust them and yourself even more. You know what you're up against and you know what will come out of it. Asking more than one person for advice does wonders for you.

After you talk to people you trust, you know what you're doing is the best you can do, and you know that your choice gives you the best outcome possible.                    ",0
"yes this may seem like the aliens did it so it can think its no real , but you have to look at the facts around it. This was taken 25 years ago.

The face of mars is a pixel image .It is a exact degree angle span.

""As a rule of thumb , you can discern things in a digital image 3 times biggger than the pixelsize, he added"". This tells how the image s an exact formation at which you can tell. Aliens wouldnt be able to do that , it can also be a different object other then a face.

this also can be many different things other then a face. It states "".. but the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusua shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the the image for all to see.

This shows the imaghe can reveal anything. Aliens coukd not make anything if they knew what they were gong to make .But scince can also prive that .

Scince equitament how the image can really come off as. For example ""...which resembles a human head .. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes , nose and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars....Thousands of anxious web site sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL wed site , revealig ... a natural landform.

"Dear Principal,

While I understand what you are saying, it is highly unreasonable. A B would be a nice grade to maintain but, many students may not be able too.

Some students who are having trouble with comprehending the material, even with help will not be able to maintain a B average. It may be difficult and put more pressure on them causing stress. Do you want your students to be even more stressed out than they already are? I don't think you want a whole bunch of stressed out kids running around your school.

There are also some students with learning disabilities. They may be having a hard time maintaining a C average. A B would just drive them crazy.

While some students may not play sports or do other school related activities, those who do are mainly there to have fun. They may not be able to have fun if there stressed out because they have to maintain a B.

Look at your students grade before you make a decision like this. Think about your students. Think about all the stress you'll cause them. Please reconsider this rule. It would really keep the students life balanced.

Sincerely,

"Our Town Does Not Need Cars

Green house pollutants from motor vehicles has been a major issue in America. Many discerning towns have made strides to stop the car exaust epidemic. I believe that our town should join the pollution free bandwagon.

Initially, living without a car will result in a happier planet. As stated in Source 1 line 5

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Our town needs to join the fight against pollutants. if we don't stop these greenhouse emissions Earth will be a disgusting wasteland of smog. As stated in source 2 "" Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" If we dont do something quick, Our home will reach this point.

To continue, life without a car would equal less stress. Imagine not being having to pay for gas, financing, insurance, and maintenence! As stated in Source 1 line 3 ""When i had a car I was always tense. im much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter."" Imagine our neighborhoods without the noise of motors. I believe life would be alot better.

To sum up, our suburbs would be increasingly better without cars. Life would be simpler. And our planet would be healthier. Getting rid of cars is a win-win situation. So please limit your car usage in our town.         ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that if you try to stop students from playing sports because they have a C or lower is ridiculous. Because besides being at school to see their friends, sports are the only thing that have to look forward to in school. And if you keep students from playing sports because of their grades then there will be some very angry students and parents. And i don't think you want the other parents talking bad about you or the school.

And the student who don't play sports have other things in school that they like and that will effect them to.

And most students can't grasp the concept like others and just because of that reason they won't be able to play the sports they want to. many students love playing basketball, football, and baseball and other activities . And many of those students who do love those sports can't keep a B average in some subjects. Because when students start playing their favorite sport they don't think about school work they think about winning the game. and students who are doing their favorite activitie

Because if you keep students from playing their favorite sport or activity they will not only get even worse in school their attitude will change completely. Some students won't even consider doing school, because you got rid of their favorite sport.

And to take that away from them because of grades is completely redundant. This is the reason why i think that if you keep students from playing their favorite sport because of the grade average is ridiculous.

"What if your principal said that everyone would have to stay after school for and extra hour only to participate in a useless activity? How would you feel if someone where to interfere with your schedule? The school says that we must participate in an extracurricular activity. You might be wondering why the school would want us to participate in a club. The whole reason is because they think that it would shape our future, give us a learning experience, and make us want to learn something new. Although this is true, there are more downsides to this rule than you think. It is completely unfair to force students to partake in an activity.

One of the disadvantages in a required school activity is that people might not have enough time to do things they normally do. If we take an extra course, there might not be enough time to finish all our homework. When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options.

Although time is no problem for some people, we students have to choose which activity we would like to do. Maybe you don't like any of the clubs or classes that are provided. Then they would have to choose a club that they do not enjoy, and would most likely not gain anything from their experience. Students will not gain any experience from the activities because it seems boring to them and they do not pay attention. I don't take any clubs because of the lack of time. There are some days however that I feel that I have no homework and I can do whatever I want to do. I try to join a club and there is nothing that interest me. I don't play any of the insanely popular sports, neither am I good at chess or other things. There is one club that I am interested in doing but they are only open on the days that I'm busy. I can join other clubs that my friends are in, but I will feel awkward because I don't know anything about certain topics. If the school makes it required to do an extra school activity, then some of us will not feel like going to our certain club. Because the clubs might be uninteresting for some students, they will not want to attend, and students will lose interest, and teachers will eventually get tired from teaching unfocused students.

Feeling tired after a long day of working is very common. We get tired because of all the stress and thinking we had to do all day. After a normal school day is over, kids are really tired and are exited to go home. We go to sleep late at night, and wake up relatively early, making it hard for us to get up, which makes us more tired than the average person. Making clubs required means that school will be extended. It is not reasonable to force the students to stay an additional few minutes to do more work. Even if the we are not tired from a school day, we still have loads of work to do after school. The same goes for the teachers. They don't want to teach kids for any longer. If the teachers have a bad day than it's even worse because they want to be alone. After their final teaching session is over, they have to do more work like grading test, projects, or homework. When school is over, I'm extremely exited to go home. I'm am sure that everyone else feels the same. If I had to stay in school for any longer, I wouldn't feel good when I come home. When I get home from the extra activity that I'm doing, I'll feel so drained and I won't be able to practice tennis, or focus on studying for a test. My English teacher, Generic_Name, says she is very tired from teaching all day. She thinks that there is no point in making kids more tired because they probably can't do their work correctly at home. With the tired students and teachers, there is no point in required extracurricular activities.

There is more to just being tired, time management, and interest. We are not going to gain anything from the classes and we will certainly not approve of it. Making after school clubs required creates more problems, Not just for the students and teachers, but for the whole school. Think about what you would gain from the extra school classes, and how easy it is to get that experience by a different, easier method. Our schedule is so cramped we can't add anything else. Some of us might not have like any classes that are provided. Almost all of us would be tired from all the new things we have to do. Think about how tired you would be, and how much time you really have, because extracurricular activities should not be required.",0

"The author uses a lot of clear evidence to discribe how the scientists are tring to study Venus. Also, the author discribes the dangers of doing so. The author also tells us what the problems are with studing Venus. The real question is, is it really worth it?

One of the biggest problems with exploring Venus is that Venuses aptnosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide and the timperatures average over 800 degrees. Another problem is that the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than here on earth. Also Venus is some times mistaken for a star because the plannet is so bright.

At one point Venus would have had features just like earth and have water surounding it. Venus is also known as the the twin to earth because they are so similar in features. NASA would send shipes into space and go to Venus but they could never lang on Venus. They haven't had a succesful space travel to Venus in 30 years. NASA is thinking about sending a blimp like craft to venus and have it hover over Venus at like 30 miles off the ground. Even at 30 miles off the ground the tempurtures will be around 170 Fahrenheit.

With what the passage states it is safe to say that there are a lot of dangers NASA would have to address before they launch another space ship to Venus. But also there are a lot of possibilities that NASA has when they launch the space ship to Venus. NASA can be the ones who discovered Venus, also they could learn more about Venus and why it lost all its earth like features.

In conclusion, the idea of learning more about Venus is a great opportunity to learn more about the planets around us. Also, learning about how Venus lost the Earth like features is a good way to learn about our planet and how to keep Earth from becoming that way. This idea of risking everything to go and explore Venus is a great opprtunity for us at earth to learn about how other planets like ours were destroyed.",0
" The perception of someone's impression is not always fixed and cannot be easily altered. While it is true that people's impressions can change over time or in response to their surroundings, it is not always possible to change someone's initial impression.

For example, my friend is someone who is constantly changing her mood and behavior, and her first impression can be very different from her subsequent ones. When I first met her, she was very friendly and positive, but when she came to my house the next day, she was in a bad mood and seemed unhappy. However, when I asked her about her day, she was able to explain why she was feeling that way and we were able to have a productive conversation.

Similarly, my parents often comment on how my friend's voice is very good, but her impression changed after I saw how she reacted to others. I was surprised by how different she was from me and how she seemed to have a different set of values and beliefs. However, I later realized that people are like doors that need a specific key to open them and understand their thoughts and feelings.

In conclusion, while it is possible for someone's impression to change over time, it is not always possible to change someone's initial impression. It is important to understand that people are complex and multifaceted, and their impressions can be influenced by a variety of factors, including their surroundings, experiences, and emotions.",1

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that extending the school day by two hours could have both positive and negative effects on students' ability to learn and succeed. On one hand, it could provide more time for students to complete their work and improve their grades. On the other hand, it could lead to cognitive impairment and reduced availability of after-school activities.

Firstly, extending the school day could provide more time for students to complete their work and improve their grades. This could be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with time management or who have a lot of homework assignments. By having more time to work on their assignments, students could reduce their stress levels and improve their grades. Additionally, teachers could use the extra time to provide additional support and guidance to students who need it.

However, there are also potential risks associated with extending the school day. One of the biggest risks is cognitive impairment. Studies have shown that students who attend school for longer periods of time are more likely to experience cognitive impairment, which can negatively impact their ability to learn and succeed. This could be particularly problematic for students who already struggle with attention and focus.

Another potential risk is reduced availability of after-school activities. Many students participate in extracurricular activities after school, such as sports, music, and clubs. If the school day is extended, it could limit the time available for these activities. This could be particularly problematic for students who rely on these activities to develop their social skills and interests.

Finally, having a four-day workweek could also impact students' ability to learn and succeed. While some students may prefer a four-day workweek, others may struggle to manage their time effectively. Additionally, teachers may struggle to provide adequate support and guidance to students who are not in the classroom for as much time.

In conclusion, while extending the school day by two hours could provide more time for students to complete their work and improve their grades, it could also lead to cognitive impairment and reduced availability of after-school activities. Additionally, having a four-day workweek could also impact students' ability to learn and succeed. Ultimately, whether or not the current school day should be changed depends on a variety of factors, including the needs and preferences of students and teachers, as well as the potential risks and benefits of different options.",1
"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I completely understand your reasoning behind this policy. I also agree that grades come before sports, and that you should be doing well in school before you participate in an after school activity. However, I feel that a B average is asking a little too much.

These after school activities often take up 1.5-2 hours of our day after school. That is also 1.5-2 hours of time that we could use to complete homework. We as students have lives outside of school. We may have family matters, Boy Scout meetings, other sports activities, instrument lessons, etc.. These activities can be very pressuring on the students. When we often have up to five hours of activities after school, and two hours of homework, having to maintain a B average can be very stressful on the students. Me, being in multiple accelerated classes, receive a lot of homework. It usually takes me about two hours to complete all of it thoroughly. I also play sports year-round, and I have boy scout meetings once a week. With all of these tasks that I must complete, holding on to a B average is often difficult.

Things that are happening at home often come into play, too. I have four brothers that are all younger than me. Like most small children, they like to run around and make a lot of noise. Most people would agree with me when I say that these are not ideal working conditions. With these conditions, I most often cannot complete all of my work as soon as I get home from school. I do have the option of waiting until they go to bed to complete my work, however staying up late is not something I enjoy, for the reason that I am a teenager, and need more sleep. If the requirement for participation is lowered to a C average, not only will more students be able to participate in after school activities, they also won't have to be as concerned about completing everything. I'm not saying that students will stop trying, they just won't have to go beyond the impossible, just to run cross country, or play basketball. If the limit is a C average, they will be able to continue what they are doing and still be able to enjoy school.

In conclusion, if the minimum grade for participating is lowered to a C, instead of a B, many students will enjoy it. They will feel much more relieved, they will be able to enjoy their after school activities without a huge worry about homework, and they will be more inclined to listen in class because of the lack of stress. Because the stress level is lowered, the students' grades could naturally raise to a B average, possibly an A.

"hello, state senator, i argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. there aree many things wrong with it. voters dont actually vote for a slate of electors, who elect whos the president. the elctors could be anyone not holding office. voters cant always vote for their electors either.

the single best arguement againt the electoral college is the disaster factor. faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their parties canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

perhaps maybe there was a tie in the electorial vote. this is considered the most worring of all. the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, this is unfair to voters.. because of the winner takes all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.

as to end this argument, i have to say the electorial college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.    ",0
is setting an good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people or are there better ways too influence others my opinion is that setting a good example can influence other people around you why because if they see you do something good they might catch on and say oh since he was being nice im start doing the same thing and start doing good deeds and that will help others because than people will start catching on and start being to nice to everyone. your setting example for the younger kids because most of the kids look up to there older siblings saying when i grow up i want to be like them so setting an example for the youth or anybody is great. it also helps with safety too if there was something going down like a robbery or a shooting adults will probaly try yo protect the younger kids and than when some adults see some kids by themeselves they will see other adults and run to protect more kids. and if your in school and you went to class and show up on time teachers can use you as an example for coming in on time being ready to do your work and people will look up tp that and say i want my teacher to use me as an example and start doing the same thing they'll be on time and ready to do there work.,0
"Hey, so I'm gonna write this essay about why first impressions are possible to change. I think it's pretty cool because I've had some experiences where I've met someone and they were really mean or whatever, but then we hung out more and they were actually pretty cool. Like, my sister's friend was super rude to me the first time we met, but then we did a project together and she was actually really nice and funny.

So, the first impression thing is like, it's not always accurate. Sometimes people are just having a bad day or something, and they're not really being themselves. And sometimes, like, people can change their personality or something. Like, my best friend used to be really shy and quiet, but now she's more outgoing and stuff. So, it's not like you can always judge someone based on one interaction or whatever.

And also, like, rudeness is not always a bad thing. Sometimes people are just trying to be funny or whatever, and they don't mean anything by it. So, you can't always assume that someone is gonna be mean or whatever just because they were rude at first.

I think it's important to give people a chance and get to know them better before you judge them. Because, like, you might find out that they're actually really cool once you get to know them. And also, like, you might learn something new about yourself too. Like, maybe you're not as shy as you thought you were, or whatever.

So, yeah, first impressions are possible to change. And it's important to keep an open mind and not judge people too quickly. Because, like, you never know, they might end up being your best friend or something.

Oh, and I guess one more thing. Sometimes people can change their appearance or something, and that can change how you perceive them. Like, my friend got a haircut and it totally changed how I saw him. So, it's not just about personality or whatever, but also about how they look.

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you think it's good. Let me know if you have any questions or whatever. Thanks for reading!",1
"The faicl action coding seems like a good idea. My claim is that it would be cool to go into a classroom and be able to tell what mood your are in. It says in the passage ""a classroom computer could recognized when a student is becoming confused or bored."" That would be a really cool thing to do at school. I think its a good idea asnd I am not going to argue about this suggestion. If you can walk into a classroom and you can tell if a child is happy, sad, confused or even just bored you will be able to know if they are okay. If a child is sad you can try and help them and out and see what is going on.

In the passage it says, ""hold on, we can actually calculate emotions."" well yes if you actually give it a try. It would be seriously so cool to know how someone feels just by looking at a screen when they walk into a classroom. I think it would help some students, honestly if you tried this expirement. Students wouldn't know what to think if they had this in their classroom. None can just walk into a classroom and tell if they are happy or sad. It says that ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans.""

They said that they have classified ""six basix emotions- happiness, surpirse, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This might help a lot of people out if they do this. If you can tell a kid is sad you can help the kid. Maybe he or she is having problems at home and they need help but they don't say it. The facial action coding system might help people. It's a good idea, but it's actually a reall good expirement to test it out and see whats going to happen. You can alwyas take it out if it doesn't work out, or if it does you can keep doing what you are doing and you'll be able to see kids facial expressions and what they feel when they tell you they don't feel anything.

Facial Action Coding is just a different way to expirement different things about children. Maybe teachers can bump their classrooms up to funner and more satisfying things, because you will know if a kid is bored in your cass if they have that. It says that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Let's just try the facial action coding out and see where everything goes, but it seems like it's going to go good. I totally agree and I don't argue with this expirement. You learn something new everyday.       ",0
"The summer assignment is a term that middle school and high school students know all too well. Not all students are assigned a project to complete over the summer, but for those that take higher level classes (a decent portion of modern high school students), there is typically some form of work that they must complete through the summer months that relates to the course they will be taking. It has been argued, though, that summer projects are far too strenuous on students, and that, if the students had the power to synthesize their own assignments to complete through June, July, and August, it may warrant less work and a generally easier time for them. However, summer assignments are better off being designed by the teachers themselves, as teachers are experts in the subject(s) they teach, teachers possess a higher level of skills in creating projects and assignments, and an inadequate project put together by students may lead to an undesired grade in the class, as the students would not be nearly as well prepared.

At the core of every class is the teacher; teachers are masters in their field, and are highly trained to answer whatever query or insight is thrown at them in their class. To put it simply, the teacher is the one who knows the material better than anyone in the room. For example, just about every teacher within the United States must obtain a degree in teaching from a four-year university, as well as extended classes in the subject that they would like to teach. Many teachers do not stop at a four-year degree though, and continue their training through a graduate program. Quite a large part of a teacher's time and life in general becomes dedicated to this training. An extensive amount of effort is exerted by these colleges and schools, as well as the teacher, to instill the subject material into the teacher's head. It is the job of the teacher at this point to relay their extensive knowledge of a subject to the students. Many teachers become knowledgeable because of their background as well; a physics teacher may have a father who is an aeronautical engineer working at NASA, or a science teacher may have a mother who is a biologist at a genetic engineering company. Because of what these teachers have been exposed to through a large portion of their life, they have gained a further understanding of the subject they will teach, and have an open attitude to learning more about it. Teachers become experts of their field, and have the knowledge necessary to assemble a project or assignment to be done over the summer that will prepare the students for the class. A student who is assembling a summer project would never possess nearly as much knowledge as a teacher has of expectations or standards of the class.

With this extended schooling comes not only a further knowledge of the teacher's subject, but an attainment of skills in designing projects and creating assignments. As mentioned above, many teachers obtain four-year degrees in preparation for their careers, but often their degree is not in the subject they teach, but in the actual field of teaching itself. These degrees teach the essential skills necessary to educate students, and one of these skills is creating assignments. Teachers spend extensive amounts of time putting together worksheets and project rubrics, pulling material from numerous sources. What better person is there to assemble a summer project, to prepare you for a class, than someone who has undergone extensive training in putting together projects and assignments? It is important to consider, though, not just training, but experience as well. Every school day, students are assigned some form of an assignment or project to complete to further their understanding of the subject, which in turn means that every school day, there is a teacher behind each one of these assignments, creating them for the students. Teachers spend large amounts of time putting together the right assignments for their students, and with this comes a mastery of the skill. Creating projects for students is one of the core tasks a teacher must do every single day, and it would be quite contradicting of a teacher to free the job of creating a summer assignment for students, to the pupils themselves, who may have never even planned a hangout with friends, or a basic schedule of their day.

As previously mentioned, students are obviously not experienced in the skill of creating an assignment. The common sophomore or junior in high school is anywhere from fifteen to seventeen years old, and has likely never faced a situation in which they had to prepare a curriculum or a rubric for someone to complete that pertains to a specific subject. If they were given the task of compiling an assignment of a subject (that they have not learned and are not extensively knowledgeable about), the outcome would not work in favor of the student. Not only would the project likely be of low quality. but the results reaped by the student from the project may set them up for failure in the class. Another important perspective to consider is the work ethic of students, or lack thereof. High school students are not disciplined enough to sit down and put together a school assignment for themselves that, not to mention, will eat into their time away from school during the summer. This would result in a sloppy project and a deficit in the student's future performance in the class.

Every school throughout the United States, and the world in general, should aim to have strictly teacher-designed summer projects. The prospect of student-designed projects could have disastrous outcomes for the students themselves. When comparing a knowledgeable and well-trained teacher's project with an uncoordinated and inexperienced student's project, the answer should be nothing but obvious. For the sake of the student, and for the sake of common sense, no summer assignment or project should ever be student-designed.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by presenting examples of how NASA is trying their best to find a way to survey Venus, as well as state how these examples could work, and why NASA is wanting to go to Venus at all.

In paragraph 4, the author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in out solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be out nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable[.]""

The author stating the reasons why NASA (as well as other astronomers) wants to go to Venus is exactly the answer to the question. The planet could have Earth-like minerals or even evidence of past life that may have lived there long ago. Going to Venus would be risky, but given the opportunity we should explore all the planets we can, just to see what it's like.

Like Christopher Columbus exploring new lands around the world, we should be pioneers in the context of space exploration. Seeking out new life, and to go where no man has gone before, for the sheer benefit of exploration. ",0
"Dear senator,

I am not in favor of the electoral college. The electoral college may seem helpful in some ways in terms of voting, but not entirely. Think of it this way; you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether or not your votes are making a difference because you have no control over who the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.

Our county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no power for who is elected, does not help the case of being called ""corrupt"" or ""incorrect"". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the elecotrs cast their vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.

In addition to the fact the American people do not hace full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.

In paragraph eleven, it states that ""legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.

Take into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The popular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The popular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election. In paragraph 16 of the article, it states that ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)..."" Yes this trust may rarely be betrayed, but it is entirely possible. Just because it does not happen often, does not mean it is impossible...and who knows? What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?

Finally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system. Trust can always be betrayed, even if it does not happen often it can still happen without our knowledge. The people residing in the United States and under the laws of our country do not have full control on who is elected as president. I am, however in favor of election by popular vote. This means that a state casts its vote based on who the majority has voted for, and I truly believe this would system would best suit our country.                       ",0
"When people ask for advice, they mostly don't talk to one person they talk to more then one. This can help you and other people to make a better choice. They can give you more opinions. You would have more people to talk. They all have different ideas.

One reason that can help you and other people to make a better choice is talking with more people other then one. When you are talking to more then one person they have more opinions then one person. Making a cirlce and talking about what you think is going to help you make a better choice could help more then one person. If you think that one opinion is not going you make you do a better choice you have another choice to make.

Talking to more people for an advice. They could have different ideas that you can help you with the right choice that you want to make. You can hear different people taliking and not only one. If you and other people think that the choice that you are going to make is not a good choice you have more then one person to talk to. You would have more people that will help you with your adice.

This are my reasons why this can help more people make a better choice. They are many more reasons that can help people to make a better choice. If you are talking to one person they are going to help you but if you are talking with more then one person. You have a better chance to make a good choice.      ",0
"This is why I think the principle should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time because students should be able to have cell phones in school as long as they don't use it in the middle of learning things. Also as long as the ringer is off so that the student does not disturb anyone.

student should be allowed to have their phones in school because teachers hate when the students are loud when their not supposed to be talking, but with cell phones they would be occupied for a longer period of time. Also because most students who have phones already use them during school anyways so I think it would be much easier for you to just let us use them. Teachers hate having to take phones from the students when they have them out and some students may need with them at all times for personal reason. Maybe even for medical reasons. So that's why I think that we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.",0
"Dear Principle,

I know that you have been contemplating on whether or not it should be a requirement for the students of our school to perform community services. I think it would be in your best interest to read the letter i have taken the time to type for you. I believe that community service should be a completely voluntary thing. But i do think that you should initiate a school wide punishment for those caught littering on campus.

I know that my opinion might not really matter to you, and i am sure that the school board is already discussing what to do, but please hear me out. I believe that most kids don't want to do volunteer work or community service because it doesn't appeal to their interest. But i do believe that if you were to schedule field trips where we were able to go to a national park or something of the sort, students would be more enthusiastic about helping to clean the environment.

I hope you will take the time to read over my letter and take it into consideration. If you do not, i will understand. But if you do use the things that i have mentioned, i would like to receive full credit for the inspiration of my ideas. Because i believe in giving credit, where credit is due. I hope you come to a decision soon.

Sincerely,

"One example of an inspiring individual who has used failure as a way to become successful is the entrepreneur Steve Jobs. Jobs was famously fired from Apple, the company he founded, in 1985. In 1996 he returned to Apple with a renewed sense of ambition and drive, and made the decisions which turned the company around and made it the international success it is today. Jobs himself stated that being fired from his own company forced him to push himself and think differently than before, stating ""Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me... The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.” Jobs' experience with failure ultimately inspired him to become even more successful, thus demonstrating the beneficial effects that failure can have in inspiring people to become successful.",1
"Dear School Board,

I strongly support the proposal to extend the school day by one and a half hours. I believe that this change would greatly benefit students, teachers, and the school community as a whole.

Firstly, students would benefit from a longer school day in several ways. For one, they would have more time to learn and practice new skills. For example, if students had an extra hour and a half to devote to math, they could spend more time practicing problems and working on their understanding of the subject. This would lead to better academic performance and a stronger foundation in math. Additionally, a longer school day would provide students with more opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs. This would allow them to explore their interests and develop new skills outside of the classroom.

Secondly, teachers would also benefit from a longer school day. Teachers are responsible for not only teaching their students, but also preparing for their lessons and grading assignments. A longer school day would give them more time to plan and prepare for their lessons, as well as grade assignments and assessments. This would reduce their workload and allow them to focus more on their teaching and interacting with their students. Furthermore, a longer school day would provide teachers with more time to collaborate with their colleagues and share best practices. This would lead to better teaching and improved student outcomes.

Lastly, a longer school day would benefit the whole school community. For one, it would lead to a more structured and organized school day. With more time to learn and practice new skills, students would be better prepared for their future careers and lives. Additionally, a longer school day would provide a more consistent and reliable schedule for students, teachers, and parents. This would reduce the stress and confusion that can come with changes to the school schedule.

In conclusion, I strongly support the proposal to extend the school day by one and a half hours. I believe that this change would greatly benefit students, teachers, and the school community as a whole. Students would have more time to learn and practice new skills, teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for their lessons, and the school community would have a more structured and organized school day. I urge you to consider this proposal and make it a reality.

Sincerely,

"The author states that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, venus is a really hot planet and the earth is in between venus and mars but venus is closer to earth. Scientists start to study venus but it's very too hot to go to venus so scientists try to make inventions that will get information on why venus is so hot. Venus is dangerous because it is soo hot and you wouldn't make it in the conditions there.

In paragraph 3 the author states "" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments"". It also states some examples of the dangerous things like ""erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes "". Scientists are still trying to visit to venus surface even tho it's inhospitable because they are fascinated by venus because venus use to be the earth's most-like planet in our solar system. Scientistist wants to know what it is that is making venus sooo hot because like in paragraph 4 it says "" long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". Then scientistst study that venus is the hottest planet and they are now trying to study why venus is so hot.

Now NASA is trying to send humans to study venus. NASA also has a solution for scientists to go study venus in paragraph 5 it says "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" NASA made this solution so that scientists would study venus but at the same time they would be safe while doing it . NASA is now workin on other approaches to studying venus. In paragraph 7 the author states "" some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". This also shows that tying to study venus is dangerous because you wouldn't make it very long on the planet even if you've invented things to try and help.

The author is trying to get out that studying venus can be very dangerous because of the conditions venus is going thorugh. Venus is the most hottest planet and it is not the best planet to be studying because it is very dangerous. ",0
"As technology advances, humans find themselves wondering whether it is helpful or if it hinders humanity. According to Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, computer software is now able to detect emotions in facial expressions. Although the software could help notify teachers when the students feel confused, this software could also make students feel insecure and violated. The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in the classroom.

Dr. Huang believes that his new software could inhance the classroom setting. It would ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson,"" (paragraph 6). However, it is healthy for students to have human interactions with a teacher. Also, having the initiative to speak up if they do not understand something is part of becoming independent. School prepares kids for life beyond high school by giving them the freedom to speak up and to make their own decisions. Placing a Facial Action Coding System in the class would not help solve the need for students to learn how to live independently.

In paragraph two Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" I strongly disagree with this statement. Being able to express ourselves and being able to interpret things in different ways, is in our human nature. If we, as a race, should expect to rely on a computer to detect our emotions, humans would become robotic. The beauty of human nature is being able to see through peoples' emotions and forming different connections. Taking away any room for interpretating peoples' feelings would also take away the mystery and joy in life.

Just as nobody can read thoughts, our feelings should also be kept private. By adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students would not have the privacy they deserve. They would never learn how to live independently and this system would not prepare the students for life beyond school. Finally, the need for human interaction is constant. Humans need to be able to communicate face-to-face and have the freedom to interpret things differently. This open communication is what creates bonds and friendships between people. Without it, humans would not be able to enjoy life.",0
"Dear Principal [last name], 

I am writing to express my views on the proposed policy change requiring students to maintain at least a B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While I understand the intention is to encourage academic achievement, I do not think imposing this restriction is the best approach. 

Requiring a B average would unfairly punish students who are working hard but still struggling to maintain higher grades. For some students, participating in sports or clubs is important for managing stress and maintaining motivation in their other classes. Taking away these activities could actually have a negative impact on their academic performance. Every student learns differently, and extracurriculars provide an opportunity for learning skills and developing talents outside the classroom. 

A C average still shows that students are passing their classes and making an effort to succeed. Minor grade fluctuations do not necessarily indicate a lack of effort or commitment. Factors like changes in a personal or family situation could temporarily affect a student's grade without representing their true abilities. Restricting participation may discourage students from continuing to try their best if they face the risk of consequences from a single bad grade. 

Instead of requiring a B average, I think the present C average policy is fair while still reinforcing the importance of academic achievement. Students could be allowed to participate conditionally, with the requirement that they attend study sessions or work with teachers if their grades begin to drop below a C. This balanced approach supports students' well-being and continued involvement in school, while also challenging them to be responsible.

In closing, while raising standards is reasonable, an inflexible B average mandate risks doing more harm than good. I ask that you reconsider maintaining the current C average eligibility and explore alternative ways of motivating academic success that do not exclude students who are earnestly striving for improvement. Please let me know if you would like me to further explain my perspective.

Thank you for your consideration.

"Have you ever asked your friends for advice on an issue or to help solve a problem? If so, did you take that advice, or throw it to the wind without ever looking back? I believe that seeking multiple opinions allows for better decisions to be made. Asking for multiple opinions on a subject is efficient because it allows us to view an issue from multiple angles, allows for a more unbiased response, and hearing several opinions can change our thinking on a certain subject for the better.

First, asking for multiple opinions on a topic allows us to view an issue from all sides, rather than just our own. Hearing several sides of a story or particular topic, can often have an affect on our decisions. Say you and a friend get involved in an argument and you aren't sure how to handle it. You ask some friends what to do. They explain that your friend is having a bad day and some family issues at home. Rather than be upset with your friend, you decide to do everything in your power to help your friend out. Hearing other angles or sides of a story changes the way we view an issue or person, therefore plays a key role in the making of that decision or series of decisions.

Secondly, seeking advice from several people allows for a more unbiased response. For example, say a woman and her boyfriend have a disagreement. Asking her boyfriends best friend may not be such a great idea, seeing as he could be biased on the subject. Asking a group of neutral friends would prove most effective, therefore less biased. In more cases than none, one particular person may favor one side more than another, where as multiple people could appeal to both sides.

Lastly, receiving advice from several people can change our thinking on a topic for the better. An example would be, a friend of yours pulls a ruthless prank on you. Instead of laughing along with your friend, you become upset and infuriated. You make a split second decision to retaliate. Several people encourage you to inform your friend that their actions bothered you, rather than getting even. Hearing the same thing from several people can often affect the way we view a topic. Rather than repeating those infuriating actions towards your friend, you explain to that individual that you were offended and deeply upset by their prank. When we decide in our minds that something negative is a good idea, or our only option, hearing differently from multiple people with our best interest at heart becomes a deciding factor in the choices we make daily.

To sum it all up, asking multiple people for advice is more efficient that asking only one. Hearing several opinions allows for neutral, unbiased advice. Receiving advice from several friends, teachers, peers, or family members can play a rather important role on our thought process on a given topic in a positive way. And viewing all sides of a story, instead of just our own, can allow for better, more beneficial choices to be made.",0
"""Alright class now here is where you need to pay attention...,"" and the screen goes black, not to mention the only thing written in big, bold letters is the word Rebooting, planted right in the center of your once lit up screen. Online classes seem like fun at first, you get to stay home, relax and work at your own pace, until they're not. In fact online classes can bring many issues that can not only affect you majorly in the academic world but also in your mental world. The idea that students can benefit more from taking at home classes is invalid; due to students being at a bigger disadvantage than those at school and the fact that online classes can lead to overall mental health issues.

Although students taking classes at home are in a more comfortable environment than those at school, they're continuously put at a disadvantage from those who are able to receive more help at school. As understanding as it is, wanting to be in a comfortable position while tons of different information is shoved inside your brain, online students find themselves struggling to understand what is being taught to them at least 50% of the time. While students located in schools have the opportunity to ask for assistance in any subject needed by teachers, those at home are not as lucky to have teachers at home who take the time to slowly break down information for students until it fits their understanding. Struggles in comprehending subjects leads to overall, no further progress for online students who than must try and catch up to those already a subject ahead of them. Another disadvantage for students at home is the fact that they dont receive as much mental support as those in schools. For example, teachers motivate students to complete work continuously, or to do well in classes and tests all the time; students at home don't receive that support which means they dont feel motivated enough to pass tests or complete work, which than leads to failing grades and failure to turn in work. In my school my English teacher tells us a phrase that not only motivates me everyday, but encourages the idea that its okay to fail because you just have fight harder to pass in the next attempt. Or as she says,"" the first step of passing is to fail,"" thats the type of motivation that kids at home need. Though staying home while receiving an education sounds fantastic, understanding that a student will always be at a disadvantage from those at school is not, because wanting to be comfortable is not a good enough reason for falling behind.

Additionally, students taking at home classes can also be at risk of suffering through many mental health issues in the future. Normally, when a student struggles to comprehend materials they tend to get very frustrated with not only themselves but with everything around them. Later on those frustrations turn into big ball of stress. The Stress of falling behind, stress of trying to catch up, and finally, stress of not being able to understand. Eventually, that frustration and that stress, just keep building up until, one day, one just can't take it anymore,and they pop. While being in that terrible phase the anxiety monster finds that moment of weakness as an opportunity and decides to take over the students subconscious, all because at home students, as previously stated, have harder times comprehending subjects than those at school. So, we have anxiety, we got frustration, and we have some stress going around,that should be it right? Wrong, because theres is one more mental health issue that at home students are at risk of getting that not only controls a small part of the body but at least the majority of it. Ladies and gentleman, please welcome Mr. Depression to the list of mental health issues to the table. Although depression seems unlikely for students at school to get, it is actually very possible for those students at home to obtain. In school many students go through many interactions daily; whether it be talking to friends at lunch, or talking to a teacher for help, even talking to the principle when your in trouble is a daily interaction that school students go through. on the other hand, students at home dont have many interactions daily as those in school, they dont have friends to sit with at lunch or teachers to help them with work or even a principle to yell at them when they break dress code, it's just them. Eventually they will start feeling that emotion of isolation and once its there it wont go away, than that feeling of being alone well become permanent and the depression beings. Overall students at home are at bigger risk of going through many mental health issues than those in school.

However, objectors may argue that at home education encourages students to take on, and later gain, more responsibility. At home education allows students to do work at their own pace, but the student must be responsible enough to work as hard as ever to make progress. Another way students at home have more responsibility is because, if they dont understand subjects fully, it is up to them and only them to look up additional information to help them get that full comprehension. Additionally, they must stay on top of classes and work by their own will, because nobody will be there to push them to do their work besides themselves. Although at home classes can bring upon many issues for a student. they do have the opportunity to gain much responsibility, and eventually, mature.

In conclusion online classes may seem like a good idea at first, but can later be the worst decision you could ever make. online classes bring many disadvantages towards students both phiscally and mentally. They also bring on many mental health issues like stress and depression. Overall, the idea that students benefit more from taking online classes is false because, they bring students to a bigger disadvantage and the affect scholars with many mental health issues in later life.",0
"When asking for advice, some people talk to more than one person. They might want to do this for a wide array of reasons, but one of the main reasons is, because asking multiple people will help someone in making a better choice for themselves. This make the best choice this way because, they get different points of view, they can get advice they need, and so they don't get led the wrong path.

First, getting different points of view on something is important. It helps someone see both sides of an argument and what might happen if they choose one side over the other. By asking multiple people and getting multiple opinions on advice, someone would see what different people think about the situation they need advice on. One person may think that one thing might be better than another, and someone else might think something else is better, but by listening to all these options, someone would have a lot of options to choose from where they can make the best choice for themselves.

Secondly, different people think differently, so when asking for advice, someone would know something that they didn't before. This is the whole reason to ask for advice. Some people might not have a proper response to the advice someone needs, so asking the most amount of people for their take on things would be the best thing to do. Someone might not get the advice they need by asking one person because of this.

Finally, asking just one person for advise could lead someone down the wrong path, because that person may not have the best intent. People only know themselves the best, and don't know about what someone else might want to do. Inherently, we think that everyone will want to help us, but this is not the case in the real world. Someone might want to actively sabotage someone, which would lead to the person asking for advice to go ask more people for advice. Those new people that they asked for advice might actually give them the advice, because they might have good intent.

In conclusion, getting advise from multiple people is better than getting advice from one person. Someone will get different points of view that they might need on a situation. They get the advice they need, because many people think different way. Also, some people might want to lead someone astray by not giving them the advice they actually need. So, because of all this, someone should get advice from the most amount of people, so they can make the best decision or themselves.",0
"In response to driverless car technology I am personally against it. I think there are certain things that we can't be lazy about, and I strongly believe driving is one of those things. Now I commend the enginers who have worked so hard on this facinating technology. But just because I think the invention is cool doesn't mean it is effective in our everyday lives. As great as technology is in the times we live in, it can always make a mistake. I think that risking people's lives by them not having to drive is a risk I wouldn't personally take. Yes, I do see how it would be nice getting to be driven around but it could only be a matter of time until mistakes start to arise.

A point I find very important to make is the danger with mishaps occurring. This isn't just the type of technology can have a small glitch and then be fine later on. If a small glitch were to happen with this technology and results can be devistating. Now I do know that these cars can signal to the driver to take over when something goes wrong, but sometimes it only take a split second and then its to late for anyone or anything to take over.

Another very important topic is the deal with the legal system and that just seems like problems on top of problems just waiting to happen. When I say, ""the deal with the legal system"" what I am refering to is who would be responsible for an accident? Would the blame go on the driver or rider you could say, or would it go to the manufacturer? Know I realize that laws would be put in place, but I can't help but feel that these laws would be in favor of the big companies that produce these machines.

What I have been trying to say is I have come to the conclusion that the list of cons on having a driverless car are much greater than the list of pros. One thing I am sure of is that if these cars do come out that they will be quite expensive, which might be a hidden blessing. What i mean but that is that while some people might be sad they can't afford this vehicle, they might actually be saving themselves from possible injury and complications. in the future I hope that if these vehicles become available to the public that people will seriously consider the risks before investing their money into a driverless car.

"I dont not feel driverless cars are needed,because driverless cars are only going to make humans more and more lazy. There not safe for the driver or for the pedestrians. If the was to be a crach or the car were to hit someone who would be resonable the buyer to the car or manufacturer of the car? These are just some of the thing that could go wrong that the artical has pointed out.

There are also thing the artical didnt say like how meny job there getting rid of by making the cars driverless. There are job like taxi-drivers; bus-drivers; lemo-drivers and semi-dervers all out of jobs. Then you have people who aren't comterble not being the one driving and get car sick. What happend if theres ice on the ground and the car reads the spead limit as 60mps. It may break, but its going to slid and hit something or someone. There's also the fact what if someone doesn't have a driverless car and there trying to run a red light a human that was driving might be aware and stop, but someone in a driverless car are more likely not to see it because there mor then likely texting or playing on the phone then watching the road. Then there's a huge crash. These are someone of the little things no one thinks about because people think the more lazy we're able to be then the better off the world is, but its not.

I can see all the good things that can come of driverless cars but bad thing weight out over the good things. There isn't a way to be sure of the safty of drivers, pedestrians, and property. To meny things can go wong that if there was a human driver if wouldn't happen. Thing like driving slow in rain and snow or even being able to pay attention to the road the someone with the money to buy a driverless car is trying to run a light. I feel if we can't garanteed the safty of all perple animals and property around us im not for driverless cars. ",0
"When it comei to automobilei they can provide ui with numeroui benefiti. However, it would appear that limiting car uie hai far more advantagei than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide eaiier meani of commuting, and it can cut down on traffic congeition.

To begin, it would appear ai though that limited car uiage ii a environment iaving technique. For initance, within the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goei On Without Cari"" by Eliiabeth Roienthal, it itatei of the exiitence of a imall iuburban city namei Vauban, Germany that hai nearly obiolete the uie of automobilei. Within the fifth paragraph of the article they talk of why it ii io neceiiary for thii to become a trend,""Automobilei are the linchpin of iuburbi... And that, experti iay, ii a huge impediment to current efforti to draitically reduce greenhouie gai emiiiioni from tailpipe...paiienger cari are reiponiible for 12 percent of greenhouie gai emiiiioni in Europe..."". Thii bit of information informi thoie that drive of the harmful effecti that our cari are creating upon the environment. However, if we are to limit our uiei of cari, and like the reiidenti of Vauban, and find alternative meani of traniportation then maybe we can reduce the amount of greenhouie gaiei that are being given off by cari. Similarly, Parii hai taken up a iimilar idea. In Robert Dufferi article, ""Parii bani driving due to imog"" he talki of the percautioni that France hai taken to driving and why. Parii hai created a ban io that thoie who have a liicenie plate that begini with an even number cannot drive on a certain day, and the next day thoie who have a liicenie plate that itarti with an odd number cannot drive. Thii all began becauie, ""...after fivedayi of inteniifying imog... The imog rivaled Beijing, China, which ii known ai one of the moit polluted citiei in the world.""paragraph 14. Pariii efforti to create leii imog wai a iucceii and they now implement the ban on Mondayi and Tueidayi. Due to leii driveri, they were even able to reduce the amount of imog polluting the air. Limited and reitrictive uiage on cari ieemi to be very helpful when iaving the environment.

Next, the near obiolete uie of cari hai made for eaiier modei of traniportation. For example, in Eliiabeth Roienthali paiiage "" ""In German Suburb, Life Goei On Without Cari"" ihe telli of the many benifiti that limited car uie have upon their community. In paragraph iix ihe itatei that iuburbi are beginning to be,""...more compact and more acceiiible to public traniportation, with leii ipace for parking. In thii new approach, itorei are placed a walk away, on a main itreet, rather than in malli along iome diitant highway."" Thii meaning that there will be more of an eaie when traveling and everything being cloier together. No longer will people have to drive milei away for iome groceriei, they will iimply either walk or ride the bui to their deitination. They will no longer be itreiied ai to what time they have left to reach a itore that ii a diitance away. Along the iame linei, ioemtimei it can be eaiier to not drive at all. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" the author, Eliiabeth Roienthal, itatei how many people have found diffrent meani of getting to where they are going. In paragraph thirtyieven ihe iayi,"" New Yorki new bikeiharing program and iti ikyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolli reflect thoie new prioritiei..."". From the information given, it appeari ai though finding eaiier meani of traniportation have become a new popular trend. Since pricei to travel by car are ioaring, the cheapier iolution appeari to juit be walking, or ai itated, riding a bike. Leading people to belive that the near extinction of car uiage hai left ui with eaiier meani of travel.

Laitly, chooiing to not uie cari more frequently hai left ui with leii traffic. In Andrew Selikyi ""Carfree day ii ipinning into a big hit in Bogota"" he talki about the reaioing for thii. ""...millioni of Columbiani hiked, biked, ikated or took buiei to work during a carfree day yeiterday, leaving the itreeti of thii capital city eerily devoid of traffic jami.""paragraph 20. Due to the environmentaly iafe meani of travel, traffic hai become a thing of the pait. Thii can alio mean for the reiidenti, a faiter, iafer way of traveling if they take a taxi or bui to their deitination. Even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company had input to thii. Eliiabeth Roienthal wai able to incorporate a itatement into her article ""The End of Car Culture"" when on the iubject of the decline in car uiage. Mr. Ford had to iay that, ""...pedeitrian, bicycle, private cari, commercial and public traniportation traffic are woven into a connected network to iave time, conierve reiourcei, lower emiiiioni and improve iafety."" paragraph 43. Thii itatement can inform the general population that from the drop in cari on the road, it can improve our iafety and iave time becauie of the fewer motoriit on the road. That traffic ii nearing an end which can be a new age in which traffic ii gone. Which ii why, when people chooie not to uie cari it can help to reduce traffic.

In concluiion, when it comei to automobilei they can provide ui with numeroui benefiti. However, it would appear that limiting car uie hai far more advantagei than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide eaiier meani of traveling, and it can reduce traffic.",0
"Caught in An Endless Loop

In today's world, students of America are stuck in a horrendous cycle of waking up, going to school, then participating in some pointless after school activity just so they can put it on a resume for colleges. School should be a relaxing sanctuary for students to be their most authentic selves and comfortable. Some schools offer an option of online classes, which leads me to strongly believe that this should be an option everywhere. There are several different learning types, which makes it hard to please everyone, and there are so many mental disabilities that prevent students from having an easy time learning. Our school system is jaded and if we ever want to move forward in society, just like with everything else, the school system needs to be rethought out.

Imagine sitting in a crowded, noisy, dim, depressing classroom. Now imagine trying to take notes from a visual perspective when a person might be an aural learner. This is my reality at school. I am forced to learn in a visual way when my preferred way is through listening; however, this is only somewhat true. Everyone has their own way of learning, yes, but some people can learn in multiple ways. I am actually a mix of aural and visual learning; furthermore, some days I can learn best one way and other days it's the latter. Sometimes, it depends on the class and teacher. I need a visual in a Math, Science or Econ class, not necessarily for a History or English class. Some people are a tactile, hands on, learners. The word comes from a Latin word, tactus, meaning to touch. They are great in a science lab or working out math problems, or any hands on activities. With all of these learning habits, it's no wonder that some classes are harder than others. If aural or visual learners had the opportunity to take online classes, they might find that it is easier. Tactile learners might not have the easiest time with online classes, but if they learned on their own, hands on, they would have the best time.

Mental illnesses are not a joke anymore. They were never a joke; however, for the longest time, they were a taboo or simple not talked about enough. With the rise of Generation Z, which I am a part of, they are bringing more attention to mental illnesses, and schools have started taking precautions. Thankfully I do not have a mental illness, but I have friends who have shared their experiences with me. One of my friends, Generic_Name, has extreme anxiety, and so does another one of my best friends, Generic_Name. They both find that school causes way more stress for them because of having anxiety.

It's possible for them in school to have significant anxiety attacks when specific experiences trigger their anxiety. Generic_Name gets anxiety when having to make a conversation with a stranger in an unfamiliar situation. I've often had to calm her down, or at least be with her. Generic_Name's anxiety stems from the same kind of thing, but her's is more of the pressures of school in addition to interactions. To help Generic_Name, I try to take her mind off of the troubled thing to help her feel better. If Generic_Name and Generic_Name had the option to do online schooling, it would take them away from triggering their anxiety. Another friend, Generic_Name, gets anxiety from a keyboard clicking. She has trouble doing these very SOL writing tests. School should not be a pain chamber; instead, students should get the attention of care that they need.

I haven't talked about the other side of the story. If classmates are getting uncomfortable at school, then why have the schools not changed their policies. There are political stances that I could take for this, but that's not why I'm here; I'm going to give the social stance. The first point that people argue that this is the way that schools have always been. This is just the most ridiculous argument, because since when has keeping the same policies effective. Our society and community is constantly fluctuating with new waves of people and ideas. If that is changing, the school system should change with it. The more common argument that I hear is that students will not get any interacting with other classmates, therefore making them anti-social. While, students would not be in a classroom with others, this is still not a persuasive point. The schools would still offer their after class activities where people would get to socialize, and people also have other passions and activities outside of school. It almost feels like the schools are brainwashing us to believe that school is our entire childhood. It is not, and people need to start breaking this mold.

Everyone I talk to says that their voice is not big enough to make a difference in this world. They say that there's nothing that they can do, and they're just going to give up. This is not the way to live life. I know that our lives are short, but I am going to do whatever I can to make a mark on planet Earth. The question is what can everyone else do. The answer is everything matters. In order to break social norms, people need to talk, and when people start talking, sharing ideas, and carrying through their ideas, it's truly amazing what can come from it. I am not here to make anything happen overnight, but I want change and I will get change. Until then, I'll be getting up at seven-forty each morning, going to school, and going clubs and activities that will not help me in my future. ",0
"Hey there!  So, I know this is like, a super important decision for us to make, you know? Finishing high school in three years versus four years, it's like, a big deal. And I'm like, totally excited to share my thoughts on it with you! 

Okay, so let's start with the pros of finishing high school in three years.  First of all, it's like, faster and more efficient, you know? We can get our diplomas faster and start college or whatever sooner. That's like, really cool! Plus, it's like, more challenging, you know? We get to take more classes and learn more stuff in less time. It's like, a big brain workout! 

But, like, there are also some cons, you know?  One of them is that we might not have as much time to, like, explore our interests and stuff. If we're in school for three years, we might not have as much time to join clubs or sports teams or volunteer in our community. And that's like, really important for, like, personal growth and stuff. 

And another con is that we might, like, miss out on some important social experiences. I mean, high school is like, a big part of our lives, and we might not get to make as many memories or have as much fun if we're in school for three years.  I don't want to miss out on any of that! 

But, like, on the other hand, finishing high school in four years has its own set of pros and cons too!  For one thing, we get to take more time to, like, figure out what we want to do after high school. If we're in school for four years, we have more time to explore our interests and passions, and maybe even find a career path that we're really passionate about. 

And another pro is that we get to, like, have more time to develop our social skills and make new friends. High school is like, a big part of",1
"Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door; the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportations are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner.

It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to forty-thousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of Vauban's families do not even own cars, and fifty-seven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. Vauban's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in,

Paris bans driving due to smog.

Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usuage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usuage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths.

In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, roller-skates, skateboards (longboards, and penny boards), or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usuage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage.

Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in,

The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people.

In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usuage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.            ",0
"In the United states, it important to attend school whenever possible. After all, missing a single day could cause a snowball effect to start and one could fall behind easily. Some schools have started offering distance learning to allow students to attend class from home via video conference. This ingenious idea could potentially drastically reduce the negative effects of absences. It greatly benefits those who are sick for long periods of time or hospitalized, grants a level of accountability that discourages skipping school, and facilitates a faster class pacing through a reduction of wasteful review time.

Most, if not all people have experienced being sick at one point or another. There's many ways to get sick and many ways your body protects itself. When one gets the stomach flu, they should take a day to get better before returning to school, but for those who are chronically ill or hospitalized, this might not be an option. With distance learning as an option, those who are bedridden or otherwise physically incapable of getting to school for an extended period could continue to further their education and not have to worry about making up assignments when they get back. With the current system in place for homework and school projects, it's exceptionally easy to have a few days of medical leave turn into a huge headache for the sick individual, but with distance learning, a diligent student could maintain their grades and sanity even if they are incapable of being at school in person.

Keeping in mind that not everyone might have a positive attitude about school, it is important to note the accountability that comes with a distance learning option. Students would be less inclined to miss school on purpose because they would still be accountable for being in class over video. Without a doctors note or an email from a parent, it would be incredibly difficult for someone to get away with skipping class both physically and digitally without getting caught in their lie. Through this clever trick, schools would be able to crack down on the students who regularly skip school for various reasons. In this way, distance learning benefits students with an attitude problem almost as much as it benefits those with health issues.

Additionally, the distance learning system benefits teachers. With students in class physically or digitally an overwhelming majority of the time, teachers would not need to recap their last lesson as often because the students were there and don't need as much of a refresher. This would allow teachers greater flexibility in their teaching schedules, letting them breeze through the topics that students find easy in order to linger longer on more challenging material. Not only does this freedom give teachers the ability to get through material faster, but it also allows them to teach more effectively and efficiently.

One might argue that distance learning could enable cheating, but there are ways to implement it in a way that significantly reduce the chances that it's taken advantage of. For example, attending a class via video conference could count as being tardy instead of an absence or attendance, which would allow use of the system, but discourage reliance on it. Students would still need their assignments turned in physically, and would not be able to test using the call.

In conclusion, the benefits of a distance learning system far outweigh any possible negative side-effects. Such an option would encourage each student to give their education top priority. Allowing students to attend class even when sick or physically impaired would invite them to show their true colors and would allow those who push themselves to continue to achieve their goals and aspirations. Distance learning should be an option offered by every school, to promote a bright future for every student.",0
"I am in favor of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. There are several reasons why I believe this transition is necessary and beneficial for our society.

Firstly, fossil fuels are finite resources that will eventually run out. The world's oil reserves, for example, are estimated to last only another 50 years or so at current consumption rates. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power are virtually limitless and can be harnessed indefinitely. By transitioning to these sustainable energy sources, we can ensure a steady supply of energy for future generations without depleting our planet's natural resources.

Secondly, the use of fossil fuels has significant negative impacts on the environment. Burning coal, oil, and gas releases harmful pollutants into the air, contributing to climate change, acid rain, and respiratory diseases. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions and have a much smaller environmental footprint. For instance, solar panels do not emit any pollutants during operation, and wind turbines have been shown to have minimal impacts on local wildlife.

Lastly, investing in renewable energy can create new jobs and stimulate economic growth. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people worldwide in 2018. As more countries shift towards renewable energy, there will be an increasing demand for skilled workers in fields such as engineering, installation, and maintenance. This transition can also lead to increased energy independence and reduced reliance on foreign oil, which can have positive geopolitical implications.

In conclusion, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is necessary for the long-term sustainability of our planet and offers numerous economic and environmental benefits. While there may be some initial costs associated with this transition, the long-term gains far outweigh any short-term expenses. We must continue to invest in and promote the use of renewable energy sources to ensure a brighter future for ourselves and future generations.",1

"I believe that there should be no more Electoral College because it doesn't give people much of a say in who becomes President because there is just a commitee of people that are voting for the President. ""The Electoral College established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (Office of the Federal Register, Para. 1). The Electoral College only consists of qualified citizens it elect the President, so even when you vote the majority doesn't even matter because the President is only elected by those qualified citizens.

A lot of people prefer to have a different way of voting than we have now. ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but, still lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now"" (Bradford Plumer, Para. 9). This shows that more that half the country doesn't want the closed election, they want a direct election.

Some people still say that the Electoral College is a good thing because they think it is a fair way of voting for President, but even if their vote doesn't really matter they still think it is a good thing to have for our country. Also if they vote for a canidate who has the popular vote and still loses because the Electoral College voted for a different person, they might think that it is unfair, but they still think it is a good way of doing things.

All in all, we should do away with the Electoral College because it is an unproper way of voting for the President and also can be unfair. It is unfair because it doen't give people a say in who should become President. If the person running for office has the majority vote and still doesn't win, it shows that the people of this country don't really get a say in things that are important. Most Americans would like to do things as well.    ",0
"I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.",0
"In this article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they have both postive things to say about this and they have negative things to say about cars.

First, my position on driverless cars to me is a good thing because if you have to parallel park in between two cars and you're not very good then thats when the car can do it and park it perfect for you.

It's also good because say if you're texting and u drop your phone and go to pick it up and there is a car in front of you...then the car would automatically stop for you so you dont crash.

Second, It's bad because you never know when the car can mess up on you. But f anything does happen then it wont be your fault it would be the manufacturing people's fault for not checking to see if everything is good with the car. Some people wouldn't even want a driverless car because they will get bored waiting for their turn to drive.

In the end it all depends on whether or not you want a driverless car, but there are going to be very nice driverless cars in the future. I would get one but I would want it tested before I buy it because I wouldnt want to spend a lot of money on a car that didnt work like the manufactures said it would. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars drives themselves by 2020.",0
"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" is technology that can be used in the class room because some people can't figure out how good or bad someone is feeling. Teachers will be able to know if the student is learning or eithor not paying attention or sleeping in class. It'll be easier for them to know what's false and what's true expression in their situation they could be in.

In difference in the situation students can't understand someone's expression. Thanks to the technolgy now it'll be easier to figure out students emotion or anyone. The article states, "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.""""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.""

Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. In my opinion it'll be a better way to learn/read better on our emotional expressions because you""'ll have more information and could know more about everything you want or need to know about the expressions. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day, for instance, you can probably tell how a person is feeling simply by the look on their face.           ",0
"Are principle has decided to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think students should not have to do a extra activity because some kids have other things to do. And i think it should be a praivlage to do a extra class because some kids dont get good grades, or they just dont want to. I think if you are failing a class you should focus on that grade and bringing it up and getting it to at least a C or B . I also think that kids that get in trouble shouldnt be allowed to because they didnt listen or did something they wasnt suppose to . Why give a kid this if they dont listen, they dont deserve to do something like this is they are being disrespectful or not listening. Students that do get good grades above a

D ad F and arent disrespectful should be able to do this if they wanted to. The principle should let the kids decide if they want to participate in sports,work on the year book, or serve student council. If students some students did this and some students didnt do this it would be easier on the teacher in that class because schools have a lot of kids, and if you was to split the whole school up into activities there is going to be 1 teacher and a lot of kids. Now yes you can put more than 1 teacher in the rooms but if you think about it teachers have to plan there classes and what they are going to do for the rest of the week , and some teachers dont have time because they have other things they need to do after school and in school. Like what if a teacher got sick the other teacher would be by its self with all those kids . Some kids should do this because they never have or never had experience with this type of stuff and some kids will try and take advantage to this and only do it to get out of doing other stuff, thats why i think this is not a good idea ,",0
"In this essay I will be giving an argument on why this so called ""face"" is not made by aliens.

The prompt tells you that one of your colleagues says that it is created by aliens.

My job in this essay is to tell why it isn't and give an explanation.

The figure that NASA saw was a so called ""face on mars"".

They claimed that it was in the shape of a human head and it was thought to be made by aliens.

In my oppinion this is not made by aliens.

Here is a reason why.

All these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens.

Throughout the years how many have we found, none!

Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms.

There is no way to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none.

Look down on earth.

How many mesas or Buttes do we have in America, or even around the world?

Now think about this, were these man made?

No, none of these land formations were man made!

They are formed naturally by nature.

Now over the years we have found a lot of reasons how Mars is sort of like the earth.

It carries water, and it is one of the easiest planets to get to, so if you think about it, Mars could have the same land formations as we do!

Nature is a beautiful thing, and it more than likely made this so called ""face"".

Yes, you may be right in some way.

Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.

This COULD have been made by aliens.

Maybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.

That is the only argument that you have against me.

The argument that isn't even factual.

You are going off of a guess in your mind.

So overall in this essay I have covered three thing.

I have covered my first argument, which is that we have not found aliens even though we have been searching all of these years.

I have covered my second argument, which is that nature has formed many structures like this on earth, it could have been formed out of the land.

And I also covered the rebuttle, which is that there is a possibility that this was built by aliens because we have found traces.

So in conclusion, this structure was not built by humans, this was land made. ",0
"Hey, so I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about imagination and how it's been a total game-changer for me. I mean, I know some people might think that knowledge is more important and all, but let me tell you, imagination has been way more beneficial in my life.

First of all, imagination allows me to like, totally visualize things in my mind. Like, I can picture myself doing something and it's like, super real to me. It's like, my mind is a movie theater and I'm the director, you know? And it's way more fun than just sitting in a boring old classroom, learning stuff. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like learning too, but it's just not as cool as using my imagination.

And it's not just fun and games either. Imagination has helped me in so many ways. Like, when I'm solving problems or trying to figure out how to do something, my imagination helps me come up with new ideas and solutions. It's like, my mind is always coming up with new ways to do things, and it's way more effective than just relying on what I've learned in school.

But the best example of when imagination was more successful than knowledge is when I was trying to come up with a new toy idea. I was like, totally brainstorming and my imagination was coming up with all these cool ideas, like a robot that could play games with you or a toy that could change colors and stuff. And I was like, ""Whoa, this is way cooler than anything I could come up with in school!"" And then I made the toy and it was a total hit! My friends loved it and I got like, a million likes on Instagram. It was like, the coolest thing ever!

So yeah, in conclusion, imagination is way more important than knowledge. It's like, the ultimate tool for problem-solving and coming up with new ideas. And it's way more fun than just sitting in a classroom, learning stuff. So next time you're trying to solve a problem or come up with a new idea, just remember to use your imagination and let your mind run wild! It could lead to some pretty cool stuff",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with the idea of only letting students with B grade average or higher only being allowed to participate in schools sports. It is unfair to all the other students that were one point off from a B point average or those who didn't get those A' s or B' s. It will make all the other students fell left out, or feel like they're being excluded. I find this new idea unfair and I don't want it to become a rule of school.

To start, it can make these students that didn't make a B grade point average feel like they're being excluded. ""Don't exclude, you should always include."" This is what teachers have told my fellow students and I for years. I think it is unfair to not let everyone compete in sports. These students that didn't get A' s or B' s may be the people who always wanted to compete in sports, but never had thought to join or never had the guts to stand up and join the teams, but if you introduce this new rule, then they don't even get a chance to try. I think this new rule is unfair and it shouldn't be kept.

Also, not everyone is perfect in school, and not everyone gets all A' s and B' s. I've had only a few C' s, but the rest of my grades were always A' s and B' s. One little C could ruin any students chances of competing in school sports and representing their school. I don't think schools should judge kids on their grades by letting the grades decide if a student can participate in sports or not. according to this new rule, a student can have all A' s and one C, but it's not the A' s that matter then, it's that one little C. Don't let this new rule prevent any student from competing in sports.

Lastly, sports provide any student with what they always need, confidence and exercise. If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us.

So what do you think? Do you want to exclude students and make them feel like they're not good enough to participate in sports? Do you want to deprive us from healthy exercise and confidence? Please consider the consequences of keeping this new rule. I feel it is unfair and I strongly disagree with it. I don't want anyone to feel left out or worthless when it comes to sports, but do you? Thank you for your time in reading this letter. i hope you consider the consequences.

Sincerely

"Cars are part of our daily routines, they have been around for so long that we can't even remember when they first showed up, but did you know that people are starting to use other means for transportation?. Studies have shown that the number of miles driven in the united states has dropped steadily ever sice 2005, and as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the the peak.

Part of the reason lies in the recession, americans with a low income can't afford to buy new cars; not mentioning the unemployed, and now that recovery is under way, the next few years will be telling if the decrease will stop, or continue. But looking at the bright side, if the pattern persists (and many believe it will) it will be beneficial towards carbon emissions and the enviroment, without considering the fact that car transportstion is one of the largest source of america's emitions.

America isn't the only country that has seen a major decrease in car transportation, other places have taken steps to decrease the use of cars. For example, in VAUBAN, Germany, the residents of this community have given up their cars, thats right!, Vauban's are completely ""car-free"". Owning a cars is allowed, but they vanly be parked in two places, garages that can be purchased for $40,000, and of course, a home. As a result, seventy percent of the popullation does not own a car.

But why are they doing this?. Well, automobiles are used widely all around the globe, and that id a huge impediment to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Cars are responsable for 12 percent of green house emissions in Europe... and up 50 percent in some car-intesive area in the United States, that's why some places are triying to stop using vehicles, the advantage of not using cars relies on the fact that cars are dangerous to our planet, and we have to take care of our planet.

Finally(and most importantly)France and Colombia are taking major steps to fight the over-use of cars. Sice Paris has more smog than any other European capital, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numberd plates the following day, as a result congestion was down 60 percent  in Paris after 5 days. And in Bogota, Colombia, there has been a ""car-free day"" for over three years now in an attempt to promote alternative transportation, peole who refuse not use their cars are fined with a $25 dollar fine, because of this, the turnout has been large. And it has led to the construction oh 118 miles of bicycle paths.

So.... do you still want to use car?... or a bicycle?.    ",0
"Have you ever been in a problem and you're not exactly sure what to do? Well a lot of people have. Lets say you're confused on what to do when doing something, some people may try to figure out what to do by their self, some may also seek advice from others. When asking for an opinion, you're asking other people what they think. After you have gotten your advice, your set! You got an opinion that could possibly help you out. But one isn't always enough, there are loads of people that have different opinions too, one is good, but more is better.

One opinion is a door that has opportunity, but when you ask more people for opinions, it opens more doors with more opportunity. Asking for more than one opinion can be good becuase it can help you with the task at hands. With more than one opinion you can think about how they are helpful and if they are worth paying attention to. Now that you have multiple opinions, you think of which one will help you the most, you will have a bigger idea on things involving the situation. When listening to an opinion, there are details that help support their idea, and sometimes these details are worth paying attention to. What people add along with their opinion can make the room expand giving you more things to explore.

In conclusion, when having trouble with something, asking for someones advice can open up an opportunity. But when you ask for more advice from more people, there are more opportunities to explore and think about. Asking for more opinions will give you a bigger understanding on how or what to do. Opinions are helpful in about every way possible, because they add details that help you with the task at hand. The details of one can lead to the details of many, more the people, more the understanding, but hey what do i know, thats just my opinion.  ",0
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions to see humans' reactions while they are using their computers. Computers can recognize emotions by the way you look, and it is allow to the computers to understand your feelings, and to change the topic because they used this technology to see Mona Lisa's emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" When technology developed they started their project with a 3-D computer.

A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are.

According to the text in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang explains how the computer might work if the student doesn't like what he/she has in the computer and it says ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers can understand that, too."" It means that technology has developed, Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang created the FACS to see humans emotions, it has six basic as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The Doctors are showing that the new computers can see what it is in your mind because they improved the technology.

My conclusion is that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. The new technology has ""Empathy because it can feels someone else's emotions and can handle the complex algorithms. ",0
"Dear Principal,

I am writing you this letter to tell you my opinion on the new rule for sports. I think that having to have a B average to participate in a sport is unnecessary. Many students work hard to get a C average and are interested in playing sports. The idea that you need a B average to play a sport is wrong. There are many students are interested in playing sports in the school and having a C average is sometimes very difficult. If you change the average for the sports there will be much less people on the teams because of the fact that a B average is pretty difficult to obtain when you have to think about so many things on your mind at once. The responsibilities of being a higher level student are getting more in depth and as a student you cant have to worry about trying to keep and above B average and being a good teammate. You will also be loosing many students who for some reason cant keep a B average and may have problems at home or maybe even in school. So that certain persons grades may be falling a little short and they cant think straight. But then if they have to worry about keeping their grades up and other problems that they may encounter as a teenager would just be too much on their mind. There may be more troubles with parents also. If a student is very excited to start to play a sport but doesn't have the required grades then it would be sad for them to have to be let down by the school after being so enthusiastic about starting that sport. So it is a bad idea to bring up the required grade average to a B instead of a C. I hope you take this to mind for it is a very sought after subject that shouldn't be changed.

Sincerely,

Student",0
"Have you ever wanted to ride the waves? Well, I did. I was a seagoing cowboy. My name is Luke. I think you will like seagoing Cowboys because you can visit cool places, have fun with other crew mates, and see cool things. Here is why you can see cool places.

When you are a seagoing cowboy, that means that you get to move cattle around on a boat and visit neat places. When I was a seagoing cowboy, I went to places like China and Greece. It was pretty cool, and I think you would like it if you try it. Now, I will tell you how to have fun with other crew mates.

After you drop the cattle off, you have some free space. To use that free space, me and my crew mates did a lot of fun activities. We boxed, we played baseball and volleyball, as well as table-tennis tournaments. It was really fun. Now is why you will see cool things.

When you are visiting places like China and Greece, you get to see cool things in those places. In Greece I saw the Acropolis. I also visited Venice, Italy, and went on a gondola ride. It was wonderful. I will now start to end.

While being a seagoing cowboy, you can see neat places. As well as neat places, cool structures. And, you can always have fun while doing this. I think that you should be a seagoing cowboy, it'll be the most fun you've ever had.",0
"Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". Shadows on the object give ""the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.

The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is a good idea because it can help them make a better choice.

One reason why seeking multiple opinions can help is that different people have different perspectives. For example, if you're trying to decide which book to read, you might ask your friend who loves adventure stories and your teacher who loves classic literature. Your friend might recommend a book that's full of action and excitement, while your teacher might suggest a book that's more thought-provoking and has deeper meaning. By hearing both perspectives, you can choose a book that's right for you.

Another reason why it's good to seek multiple opinions is that people can have different areas of expertise. If you're trying to decide which video game to buy, you might ask your brother who's really into sports games and your cousin who loves role-playing games. Your brother might recommend a game that's all about basketball, while your cousin might suggest a game that lets you explore a fantasy world. By talking to both of them, you can get a better sense of what each game has to offer and make a more informed decision.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help you avoid bias. If you only ask one person for advice, they might have a personal stake in the decision and try to sway you in a certain direction. For instance, if you're trying to decide which restaurant to go to, you might ask your best friend who works at one of the restaurants. They might try to convince you to go to their restaurant, even if it's not the best choice for you. By asking multiple people, you can get a more balanced view and make a decision that's based on what's best for you.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because it allows you to hear different perspectives, tap into different areas of expertise, and avoid bias. So the next time you need advice, don't be afraid to ask more than one person!",1
"""Luke, I don't understand what you are trying to get me to do!"" Bobby yelled at me.

""Bobby, don't you get it? I want you to join the sea cows with me!"" I shouted back.

""Well what the point of it anyways? Isn't it basically just farming, but on the sea? Doesn't sound like anything special to me.""

I had just explained how Ihad joined a group called the Seagoing Cowboys to my good friend Bobby. I was trying, and trying to convince him to join but, he wouldn't budge.

""Trust me Bobby, it is so much more than that. You'd get to go with me and many other great men, traveling from coast to coast, and sailong sea after sea. We get to explore so many fascinating places and see so many pieces of beautiful architecture."" I told him.

""Well, I can see all of thoses things in America, can't I?"" Bobby said in a tone dripping with sarcasam.

""No, there is so much more to see everywhere else in the world than what is to be seen here, in America."" I said

""But, it's not only that, you'd get to help people that are affected by the war. Bobby, you like to help people, don't you?""

""Well, yes I do, but I'm not sure I am comfortable going over seas with a lot of smelly, messy animals."" Bobby argued.

""Bobby, can't you just get past that? You would be able to help people in need, and not to mention the animals, but you are just going to pass that up because you don't want to be living in the same ship as these animals?""

I was quite furious at this point. He was being very stubborn, and I do not like to deal with stubborn people.

""You know what? You be as stubborn as you like. I don't care if you do not want to help people in need. You can be like that, because I've just realized you obviously aren't meant for this. You are not open-minded enough and that obviously isn't your fault."" I said fuming, but also holding a hint of sarcasm in my tone.

I am here to talk about why we should agree that being a seagoing cowboy is a really good idea so hang on tight and just listen, hope u enjoy .

Some good reasons to be a seagoing cowgirl/boy is you get to help animals while your traveling over sea. Also its a good experience and you might want to learn about the ocean, thats a good reason to be a seagoing cow girl or boy and you might want to try it out .There might be some big waves but your with animals traveling and helping out thtas important to do .Its also a beautiful ,wonwerful,aventure to explore .

I support Luke becuase he says thats its an one one life oppertunity. It was he got to travel over seas to Europe ,he went pass Greece . He also traveled over the Pacific Ocean twice,and the Artic Ocean 16 times .Its a good aventure and you should try it one day .

So he got to do alot of things that were totally awsome! I want to know do you think you should try it one day yes or no ? And please right about why you whould and who inspired you ?",0
"Failure is a natural part of life, and it is something that many people experience at some point in their lives. However, it is important to remember that failure is not the end of the road, but rather an opportunity for growth and success. In fact, many successful people have experienced failure at some point in their lives, and they have used that experience to fuel their success.

One of the main ways that failure can lead to success is through the process of learning. When we fail, we are forced to take a closer look at what went wrong and try to understand why. This process of reflection can help us identify areas where we need to improve and make changes to our approach. By learning from our mistakes, we can become better at what we do and increase our chances of success in the future.

Another way that failure can lead to success is through the development of resilience. When we experience failure, it can be easy to become discouraged and give up. However, successful people have learned to push through difficult times and keep trying, even when things are not going well. By developing resilience, we can overcome obstacles and continue to work towards our goals, even in the face of failure.

Enthusiasm and try are also important factors in achieving success. Enthusiasm is the driving force behind any successful endeavor. Without enthusiasm, it can be difficult to stay motivated and committed to our goals. By being enthusiastic about what we do, we are more likely to put in the effort and hard work needed to achieve success.

Try is also an important factor in achieving success. It is easy to give up when things get tough, but successful people have learned to keep trying, even when things are not going well. By persisting in the face of failure, we can eventually overcome obstacles and achieve our goals.

In conclusion, failure is a natural part of life, but it is not the end of the road. Rather, it is an opportunity for growth and success. By learning from our mistakes, developing resilience, being enthusiastic about what we do, and persisting in the face of failure, we can achieve our goals and become successful in all areas of our lives.",1
"Did you know that teachers work with one of the best culture of the entire world? Teachers work with smart and beautiful students who want to have a bright future. Students argue about having afterschool programs because is bored. I'll rather have afterschool programs because is a better way to improve your skills, is easier to do your homework, and it helps students with special disabilities.

One reason why I'll rather have afterschools program is because it improves your skills more than you could ever had. Afterschool programs are reasons why students have been growing a lot this past years. I had a friend call Generic_Name who had really bad grades, he sign up in a afterschool program and in a few weeks, he already had almost all A's. In transition, this is one reason why I'll rather have afterschool programs.

Another reason why I like afterschool programs is because is a easier and faster way to do your homework. I'll rather do my homework afterschool because they can help me and I could have more free time at home to do whatever I want. Homework is good to improve your grades specially if they count as a quiz grade, because quiz grades count as thirty percent of your grade! Furthermore, There's one more reason why i'll rather have afterschool programs than having nothing.

Last but not least, A reason why a like having afterschool programs is because it helps special students who have disabilities. Special students are the same as regular students, but people say that students who have problems or disabilities count as ""Special childs."" My brother had difficulties with his reading because he didn't know how to read that much, he went to a special class and he had improve his reading skills over the past ten years. Moreover, This is my last reason why i'll rather have afterschool programs.

This is all of my reasons why I'll rather have special and afterschool programs than not having nothing to do afterschool. My favorite one is that is easier to do your homework because you will have more free time at home. To get in a program, all you have to do is ask for that program's sign up paper and sign it. If you need a fun program in the whole city of Generic_City, NextUp is the best one you could find.",0
"Ok, So some people believe that the ""Unmasking The Face On Mars"" was created by aliens. Crazy right!

Well the Face On Mars is just a natural landform. to back my opinon about this it states in the passage that, "" A spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landings sities for its sister ship Viking 2, when spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" so technicaly thats how the face ofn the mars got there but, thats not it. ""Scientist figured it was another Marthian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Then the huge rock formation it resembled a human head which was formed be the shadows that were giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This would be a good way to engage the public and attraction to Mars the authors had thought. Then it began to starr in a Hollywood film, appreaed in books, magazines, radio talk shows and ect. But NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. but in the mean time defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient cilvilization on mars. but to be dirct the face on Mars was located at 41 degree north martian latitude where it was winter in April. well there is much more to this but this is some of the reasons and facts about how the face on mars was a natural landform.",0
"In life people will have problems that they will need advice on how to deal with them. If they only have one choice on dealing with something, then it would not be as fair as if they had multiple choices. The more choices a person has on one problem, the better life and the outcome will be for that person weather it is about life, a relationship, or maybe a friend.

when you are in a relationship, you need to always have a group of friends that you can go to and talk about your problems with your partner. For a example, lets say your partner lies to you about something that is not really important but important at the same time. You go talk to a friend about it and they tell you to go retaliate and you end up losing your partner forever over something that was not worth losing them. If you go to a group of friends and they all give you different ways of dealing with it then you can think about which one is better for everyone. Having choices make everything easier in life.

Another example would be school, think about your grades, group of friends that you hang out with, and about yourself. Lets say you have a big test coming up this week but you wanna play the game with your buddies so you ask your group of friends who do not get good grades what you should do and they say to forget about the test and go play with them. then you ask your grandma or grandpa who have already been through all of that and they tell you to go study. Now you have choices you can either go play the game and take that chance on getting a bad grade or study for the test and possibly get a great grade.

Finally about this thing we call life. Lets say this is your first year in high school and you feel like everything is ripping you apart, so you talk to your older family members and they all give you different responses. You now have been given choices, you can choose to keep trying to be the coolest and most popular kid in the school or be the smartest in the school and start focusing on keeping your grades up and go somewhere in life.

People will always need choices in life or more people will end up ruining their lives because they feel like they do not have a choice. When people have choices they think of the outcome of each choice and that helps them pick which one is right. this is why the more choices you have the better your life will turn out.  ",0
"No it does not work because it is very un fare to the millions of voters in the U.S. Mainly because alot of the states donot even see an ad for the presidential campaign. Also because it is not winner takes all like it is for most states. So it is not fair mainly just because of bad publicity. Also because the presidential campaign could come down to one persons vote and depending if he is bias or not it would be very unfair.

The electoral college does alsonot work because it was created by our founding fathers. Which was all the way back when this country was first starting out. So the ways that they do it is so old and does not work anymore. These are the reasons why i think that the electoral college does not work. Anymore in todays modern times where it is all out dated.    ",0
"Dear principal, i believe that u should have a policy about cell phones that allows you to have cell phones at school that you can only use during lunch, recess, and passing times. my reasons are because teens like to use cell phones to talk to other teens, what if an emergency comes up?, and what if you forgot something at home and you need to have your parents bring u it from home?

Teens like to talk to each other on cell phones to discuss current events and to discuss their feelings about school other people and their life. they need to outlet their emotions into something. and they should be able to do this at school because school is where most of the problems start out anyway and if they cant vent that out right when it happens then they wont have to deal with it throughout the day until they can get home to use their cell phones to talk to people and tell people about it.

What if an emergency comes up? What if something really bad happens at home or at school and u need to tell your parents need to talk to you about it, But you dont have a phone to talk about it, and its a really big problem like a family member is injured or has become deathly ill.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System, has a promising applications for a variety of school. Dr. Huangs studies shows that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions"". The article also includes that as humans we perform this impressive ""calculation"" every day. Dr. huang predicts if we have this facial action coding system in classrom computers it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. Having these computers in the classroom would be effiecient for parents to indcate if there child or someone close to them are having trouble communicating or show there emotions. The article indicated that the Facial Action Coding can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D coputer model of the face; Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist to classify the six basic emotions, such as happiness, surorise ,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Which help you determine there emotions. The article states ""According to the facial feedback theory of emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". Whoever thought that the Facial Action System can become very valuable to classrom computers and be so effiecient with knowing what someones emontions are. ",0
"Education is a really important part of a persons life, it shows the level of intelligence and discipline someone has acquired over the years. There are many different types of schools that offer many unique ways of introducing education. An great example is Online classes or video conferencing giving students the option to stay home and learn if they are to far away from a nearby school. Many people discuss over this topic but, overall it is not a good idea because students would not learn how to socialize with other students, it would cause health issues, and laziness.

Furthermore, students who take online classes lose the chance of hanging out and socializing with other classmates. Online classes take away the very basic skills of a child in many ways. Taking away their team work skills and also communication skills. These skills are extremely important in life they are used every second of it. These skills will help them on the long run like applying for a job. Companies look for people who are not afraid to start a conversation with the customer.

Afterwards, online classes will start to take a toll on a persons body due to looking at a screen for to long and sitting in a chair causing back problems. In public schools kids learn by the teacher in person also taking breaks once in awhile. Recess is the one thing kids love the most while their in school and this is coming from personal experience. Online classes take this gift away from the students causing them to be inactive and not having any school memories. It also damages the back in the process of learning sitting down in a chair for a few hours staring at a screen not moving out of the seat to stretch once in awhile.

Overall, laziness will start to kick in to the student saying, ""if i could do school at home what is the point of doing stuff person, when i can do it online?""They will start to question everything they do in person which the can do virtually. Now even stores offer the option for them to pick out the things you want and deliver them to the customers car. That is just a big example of laziness ! Why would someone need an employee of the store to hand pick out your wants and to even deliver them and place them inside the car. Many big stores and cellular applications offer this like Walmart, Grubhub,and etc. Which introduced a whole new world of laziness showing kids to take the easy way out of duties and responsibilities, when they have a problem and having difficulty finding a solution.

Otherwise, online classes are not the best idea but, they can be improved in lots of ways. My statement overall is a negative one because online classes introduce laziness,health issues to students,and also take basic skills away from students that they will need in the real word.       ",0
"The idea of a four day school week has been gaining traction in recent years, particularly among educators and school administrators who are seeking to find new ways to improve educational outcomes. While there are several potential benefits to a four day school week, such as streamlined calendars that allow teachers and students additional free time for more rest and relaxation, there are also a number of drawbacks that must be taken into consideration. These include additional pressure on teachers to cram in more lessons during the condensed weeks, as well as additional stress and fatigue for students who have to cram more information into a shorter timeframe.

In contrast, a seven day school week provides many advantages over a four day school week, especially for students and teachers. A seven day school week can provide more flexible scheduling and an increased number of instructional hours, while allowing for more frequent breaks and downtime to give students and teachers a much-needed reprieve. Furthermore, a seven day school week offers more opportunity for teachers to engage their students in new and exciting learning activities, such as field trips and other hands-on educational experiences.

In conclusion, a seven day school week has numerous benefits over a four day school week. It ensures more instructional hours, more flexible scheduling, and more opportunities for students to engage in educational activities and field trips. Additionally, it also offers more downtime for students and teachers to recharge and take a break from the academic pressure they experience during the regular school week. Overall, the seven day school week offers numerous advantages that make it a better choice for both students and teachers.",1
"Hello , im Luke from the Seagoing Cowboy program. I`m sure you you have heard about me. We have so much fun aboard the ships some things you might get to do are: playing table tennis, fencing,games of baseball, volleyball, and boxing. If you are not interested in those activities we also read, and play games to pass time. The best part about the job is going to all diffrent countries.

You also have to be aware that you have to do many jobs like: taking hay and oats to stalls, cleaning the stalls, and serving as night watchman ( you have to be really careful if you do that job because if it is raining the deck can be slippery and you could fall and hurt yourself.) You also get to take turns with other crew members while on the ship. When we reach the the country where we deliver the horses you get to explore many other things. Like I have explored a castle before. You also might get to ride the streets of Venice, Italy.

I hope you have read this and are happy to come. Make sure you are hard working , and are strong to carry food for the animals. We will appreciate you coming aboard to help with the animals. we hope you decide to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Thanks again , Luke Bomberger.        ",0
"The author does a great job explaining how the study of the intense planet Venus is worth it in the long run. Using many examples and providing the readers with pleanty of facts that support his claim that ''the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author states in paragraph 4 ""if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" Dispite all the negitive aspects of this planet the scientists still want to undergo with the study of its surface and conditions. Stating that Venus might have been the most Earth-like planet years and years ago forming similar mountains and valleys. Possibly covored by oceans just the same as our home planet Earth.

Venus may never be habitable by humans because of the harsh conditions the surface goes through with a sitting temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and a atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than the Earths. One of the reasons stated by scientists in paragraph 4 that make the study of venus so important is that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration giventhe long time frames of space travel. This exploration of the planet is going to be different because old technology is going to be used to get information. The reasons for this is because the techology today is to delacate for the conditions on the planets surface.

Therefor the author provides the reader with facts about the risks of studying the planet venus. Dispite all the negitive aspects the author supports his claim with signifigent evedence and reasoning for the study of venus to be dubed worthy of further study. The harsh conditions are just one obstical that todays scientists are going to have to work to through to get the information they need about the misterious planet Venus. ",0
"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college process consits of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes byCongress. The Electoral College consits of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for thePresident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows much worse. Considering thst the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, end that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy wouldn't have actually gone to Kennedy.)

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the argument against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: ""Abolish the electoral college!""

Abolishing the Electoral college should be the right thing to do.    ",0
"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" There are 3 reasons why I agree with this statement. The first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that you'll have more of enthusiasm when you're find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals.

I agree strongly with this prompt and Winston Chruchill's quote, yet some people think it's something at may not be true and think less of them self. In the first paragraph I will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it.

First, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. Even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. Albert Enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. The only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. He used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. Even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when they've failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning.

Next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. Thomas Edison thought different, even though he had failed 100 times, he had not gave up. When he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. That quote was ""I didn't fail 100 times, I found 100 ways that it didn't work."" Even though, Thomas Edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, Failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success.

Finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. It don't matter what others may think of it or if you'll be able to achive or not. Show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure don't stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. You'll reach higher goals with higher potential then what you'll ever imagine. Then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world.

In conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. Finding a way to solve it is achive your success. Get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. Even if failure is a role in life to find success it's the only way youll reach it. Failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",0
"Venus ia indeed a very powerful planet that can cause harm to the human race. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (paragraph 3) Yes, there are a lot of dangers and the human race can be hurt, but what happens when the earth runs out of supllies to support the human race? Where will we ge then?

It is important to explore all of the other options we have when it comes to places for the human race to go when we run out of supplies and options. Yes, Venus has a lot of risk but when it comes to saving the human race I think it's a risk worth taking. There are a couple things that the Earth and Venus have in common. ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" There are postive things about Venus as well. Every option is going to have it's negitives and it's postivies.

Some of our explores think they might have a solution for humans to live on Venus. ""NASA's possible soltins to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp- like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. JUst as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions bu staying up and out of their way."" ( paragraph 5) There are a lot of dangers when is comes to living on Venus but we might have solutions for them. When is comes to the human race and having a plan B, I think this is something to consider.

Yes, there are quite a few risk when it comes to moving the human race to live on Venus. But NASA thinks that they have a way around that. There a couple things that Earth and Venus even have in common when it comes to the geographical aspects of the planets. Yes, living on Venus comes with changes and yes, it would be a big change. I think it's a risk worth taking. ",0
"From riding horses with wagons to, driving cars. this has been a big impact on everyones life. some people drive their cars to get place to place. Others either ride a bike or even they walk to get to where they need to be. In other words some people use cars and some people dont have the money to or just dont want to. So the question remains does not having cars have a affect on our lifes?

Perhaps people think that everyone in the world needs a car that is not true. For example:In the article Heidrun Walter said that""When i had a car i was always so tense. Im much happier this way."" He said this because he even moved to Vauban where 70% of the families do not own cars and 57% sold their cars to move there. my next example will be by David Goldberg he says: ""all of our development since wwe has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. And i think he is right most people in the world are focused on what kind of car to get and how much they cost. Well maybe we as the people should spent a little less time on cars and a little more on how to better the economy.

Next, In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Because if this happening it will end up that the world will have less accidents on the roads and highways so that means that we will have less people dying becaues of the accidents. For my next example: Vauban homes are 5500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for paking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

The other way to look at it is that hw are people going to get to work? How are they going to get to the store? Well how are people going to do all these thinds if the dont have a car. If all the car in the world was banned that woould be a bad idea because people would have to star knowing all of the bus,train and subway scheduals so that they would be able to get to work on time. But if they had a car they would not have to do all of that they would just get in to their car and go. Another reason what if you miss your ride to work and your already late then you would have to make a choice to either what for another bus or walk to work either way you are going to end up be late to work. this plan only works if everything that you want and need are very close to where you live and most of the time everything that we want and need are not even close to where we live and way to far to walk.

People all over the world depend a lot on cars but we shouldnt. A lot of time i think that people in america are just being lazy. If you think about it if we take all the cars away then we wouldnt have to pay for gas,insurance, or for that matter buy a car. If we do this everything would be much closer together and it would be in walkin distance and you would be able to save a lot of money.",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that implementing a homework club in our school would greatly benefit both students and teachers. Homework is a crucial aspect of a student's academic success, but for some students, it can be overwhelming and time-consuming. A homework club would provide a supportive environment where students can work on their homework together and receive guidance from experienced teachers.

One of the main benefits of a homework club is that it would provide students with a sense of community and support. Many students struggle with homework, and it can be difficult to ask for help from teachers or classmates. A homework club would provide a safe space where students can work together and ask questions without fear of judgment. Additionally, teachers would be able to provide individualized support to students who need it, which could lead to improved learning outcomes.

Another benefit of a homework club is that it could help reduce stress and anxiety for students. Homework can be a source of stress for many students, and this stress can have a negative impact on their mental health. By providing a supportive environment where students can work together, a homework club could help reduce stress and anxiety levels.

However, there are also costs associated with creating a homework club. Teachers would need to be trained and paid to lead the club, and resources such as textbooks and materials would need to be provided. Additionally, there would be costs associated with renting a space for the club to meet in. While these costs may seem daunting, they are necessary to ensure the success of the club.

In conclusion, I believe that implementing a homework club in our school would greatly benefit both students and teachers. The benefits of a supportive environment, individualized support, and reduced stress and anxiety outweigh the costs associated with creating the club. I urge our school district to consider implementing a homework club to improve student learning outcomes and support the academic success of our students.",1
"The Benefits of Online Learning

Students would definitely benefit from attending online classes. For most students, school is known to be a stressful learning environment. This makes it harder for students to learn and feel comfortable in what they're learning. If students had online classes, they would have more freedom in their learning. Also, students would feel comfortable and have less stress. Attending classes online would make students have a desire to learn more. Students would not only benefit from online learning, but they would also enjoy online classes.

First and foremost, students would benefit from online classes because they would more freedom in their learning. When students are at school, they tend to have a schedule and they're told exactly what to do and when to do it. From personal experience, I've learned that most students don't enjoy being forced to do something. Being told what to do and when to do it, makes the learning environment more stressful for students. Therefore, the more freedom students have the less stress they'll receive. At school, students have some unreasonable consequences. If students did online learning, they would benefit from not having as many consequences. Student would benefit from having less consequences. Therefore, students should have the right to their freedom, especially when it comes to what they're learning.

Also, students would feel more comfortable and enjoy online classes. The average student, plays sports or does extracurricular activities, making their schedule more difficult. Online school would provide students with a more flexible schedule. Students would also be able to do and try new things outside of the classroom. Activities keep students engaged, making them want to learn. This also makes learning more fun and helps students further their learning. The less stress students have the more successful they'll be. Students can't have fun with what they're learning if they're stressed. Having a lot of stressful causes students to not do well in school. For some students, stress can be helpful, but for the average high school student stress isn't beneficial and cause more issues for students. Students should be able to have fun and enjoy their learning for their benefit.

Others may say online school isn't beneficial, but students are going to pay more attention and have less stress. Students already don't enjoy the idea of coming to school everyday, and being told what to do and how to act. Some of the rules at school can be unreasonable for students causing students to get into more trouble. Online classes would take away that trouble. Therefore, making students want to learn and do better. If students were more comfortable in their learning environment, they would be more encouraged to learn.

Finally, students are constantly stressed everyday from school. Making it difficult for students to enjoy what they're learning causing them to slack off. If students felt more comfortable in their learning environment, they would be more successful. Every parent and teacher should want to see their student succeed. Online school sounds like the perfect plan for students. Every student should be able to enjoy what they're learning. In conclusion, online classes can beneficial to students causing them to have a more successful future. ",0
"There are three examples about if I agree or desagree about the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life"". I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons.

Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it . Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people don't do it . If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person.

Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person . Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you.

Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they don't pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and that's why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

In conclusion,in this three examples I give reasons that why I agree or desagree with the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life"". If you have a positive attitude that can make you a better person or successful for yourself and other people.",0
"Somethings that I have observed is that when taking long trips by ground vehicles often times the driver will get tired of driving so they put their vehicle in cruise mode, now that is a nice aspect to the vehicle. Taking it one step further so that the vehicle can steer, accelerate, brake themsleves, and alert the driver to take over when nearby problems occur such as navigating through work zones and around accidents now that is even cooler. Like the article says the system has a warning system so that the seat vibrates or a light on the windshield flashes to warn of problems that are nearby. Now that sounds great but there should be even more safety like the article says installing a camera so that the vehicle is watching the driver while the driver watches the road. I am all for the driverless vehicle but some factors are necessary to take in terms of safety.

The vehicle may have a warning system which is great, but what if the warning system fails to warn. I get that there are complications that can occur such as the driver less system failing to work properly. When accidents do happen like this whose to blame is it the driver or the manufacturer. If say a mother has her children with her and the system fails and crashes does the driver have the ability to sue the manufacturer. Now if something like this does happen and it goes out to the public how many people are going to purchase the vehicle.

Like I said before I am for the driver less car, it sounds great, but people need to take in to consideration about safety. I have given my two cents about the driver less car it is time to make it work.",0
"Technology all around us is evolving, we're now to the point where we can tell how exactly Mona Lisa was feeling when her famous picture was painted. Due to new technology such as, the Facial Action Coding System, professionals can tell exactly how someone is feeling in a picture, or even in class during a lesson. This new application will have a massive impact on how teachers educate kids. This will help out teachers with how to teach a lesson and improve how engaged kids will be in class.

First, classroom computers could use this program to recongnize when a student is confused or bored. The computer would then modify the lesson so the student will hopefully become interested again. This program could really get kids to learn and become interested about what is being taught. This would ultimately lead to higher passing rates and better futures for kids.

Secondly, this technology can make video games or video surgery alot more expressive. Some faces in videos are really bland and boring. If the faces were better detailed and more expressive the viewer will be interested and will pay more attention. Expressions on animated faces are really important, these features draw the viewers attention and will interest them.

All in all, this new technology is very valuable in a classroom. It would durrastically change how kids learn and would make them way more interested than they currently are. Most kids do not learn the same, this technology could change that so each student can learn the way that best helps them. This application will help out teachers tremendously and could really improve passing rates! ",0
"Hello and my name is Luke and I am a Seagoing Cowboy.

I have seen many things since I became one.

So, I want you to try and give it a chance.

My friend, Don, invited me to go to sea when I was working in a grocery store and bank.

I couldn't say no so I went with him.

When I got there, they hired Seagoing Cowboys to go out on the ocean.

When I became one, I had to go to Greece.

But before I got there, I turned eighteen years old.

Then, after the trip to Greece, I made nine trips, more than any other Seagoing Cowboy.

You get see amazing sights when you are on a trip.

Taking care of horses and cattle on the sea can be very fun.

It is a very fun thing to do on the sea.

But if you hve little paitience, I don't think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One normal trip is can be about two weeks.

And a trip to China can be about a month.

But if you can handle paitience, I would be okay with you trying the program.

So if you like going to foreign countries, raising cattle, and going on sea, you should try the program.",0
"I participated at a Seagoing Cowboys Progam and changed a lot of lives and you should to. On the job you will have to take care of animals. You will get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. You will get to help other people in their countries and their needs. You can also help countries recover if you participate.

You should also participate because it can change your life as it did to Luke Bomberger. In 1947 I had made nine trips and was the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy. Caring for animals during the crossing keeps you busy depending how far your destination is and how much time it will take to get you there. It helps make you more aware of the other peoples countires and their needs.

In your spare time there you can do some fun stuff. Such as playing baseball, volleyball games, boxing, and more. You can also sight see on your spare time. It was one in a lifetime opportunity for me to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion you should be a Seagoing Cowboy because it not only changes others lives but also yours. It made me more aware of other people in their countries and their needs. It took me through a lot of adventures. It opened up the world to me.  ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students shouldn't have to perform community service because it take time away from their free time, they already have home work and class work to complete and turn in on time. So don't you think its a little to much for them?

Some kids already are struggling with just home work some with class but a lot of people struggle with both and are failing because of it. So why would you want to give them another thing to do? I'm sure there has to be some people who actually want to but you cant force people who just don't have the time. Kids are kids they need their space and just some time to their self to hang out with their friends.

How would you like it if you had to do all that work and the only time you had a break was when you went home to sleep or eat dinner? Its not fair to the students that they have to do all this with out having a choice weather or not they want to do it! Its bad enough we have home work and school we don't need another thing on our shoulders making things difficult for us.

We try our best to do every thing but sometimes we just can't. That is why i think we shouldn't have to perform community service!

"Imagine the world in the future, completely full and covered with cars. Roads are going to start taking up every area of Earth, if people continue driving everywhere and buying cars. I think people should limit car usage because it's environmental friendly, they'll get more exercise, and people will be happier. Cars can be handy from time to time, but i think they should only be used occasionally. Imagine if there was a car for everyone on the planet. Car usage should decrease.

First of all, the Earth is beautiful and the people on it need to take better care of it. For example, just one day without the use of cars in a city, allowed them to construct bike paths, new sidewalks, and reduced traffic jams. Fuel from cars will polute the air and cause smog. If everyone continues to use cars as much as they do or more, there will be no way to clean all the air. When Paris banned cars for a while, smog was cleared and reduced by a lot. Limiting car use will not save the Earth completely, but it will help very much.

Secondly, if people started using cars less, they could get outside more and get more exercise. Biking will help people get fresh air and decrease pollution because cars won't be used as much. People should start finding jobs or doing activities that are close enough to walk or bike to. Cars are for situations in which you really have no other way there or long distances. That's all I think they should be used for. Everyone would be much more fit and healthy if it weren't for being lazy and having to take a car there.

Lastly, not using cars could increase people's happiness. Some people suggest that having a car makes them tense. Everyone would become much closer together and explore more of the world without cars. We could all be outdoors or around each other more. For example, you could take the bus to work instead of your car and meet a new friend. You never know what could happen when you try something new. It's good to change things up once in a while, like not taking your car every now and then and finding another way there.

In conclusion, the positives definetely outnumber the negatives of limiting car use. The main three reasons in my opinion is that it's environmental friendly, you'll get more exercise, and you'll most likely be much happier. Think about all the good outcomes that could come out of not driving your car and try it sometime.",0
"Dear Principal,

After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.

Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost ""dared"" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.

The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.

One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.

I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.

Sincerely,

" Having shorter summer breaks can be beneficial for students to remember information. While some students may prefer longer summer breaks, I believe that schools should be year-round to provide students with more opportunities to learn and grow.

One of the main benefits of having year-round schools is that students can have more time to focus on their studies. With shorter summer breaks, students can use their time off to catch up on any work they may have fallen behind on during the school year. Additionally, students can use their summer break to take advantage of any opportunities to learn and grow, such as internships, camps, or workshops.

Another benefit of year-round schools is that students can have more opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities. With more time off throughout the year, students can participate in more sports, clubs, and other activities that they may not have time for during the school year. This can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management.

Finally, year-round schools can also provide students with more opportunities to travel and explore new cultures. With shorter summer breaks, students can take advantage of any opportunities to travel and see new places. This can help students broaden their horizons and gain new perspectives on the world.

In conclusion, I believe that year-round schools can provide students with many benefits, including more time to focus on their studies, more opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities, and more opportunities to travel and explore new cultures. While some may prefer longer summer breaks, I believe that the benefits of year-round schools outweigh any potential drawbacks.",1
"Today ¸ drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Why ? Because too many accidents are happening causing people people to lose their loved ones and important people in their life. Another reason is because it is a law now and you shouldn't be breaking the law. Then it causes a lack of driving skills.

Everyday people die in car accident because they use cell phones. Over the past couple of years, over 1.5 million people have lost their life or loved one's due to people being on their phones while driving. Being on your phone while driving is so dangerous because you can hit somebody and cause a bad wreck possibly killing somebody, putting them in the hospital, making them paralyzed , and not just that, but losing your car. People should not use cell phones while driving because a person could be having a conversation, they might get upset, and it could cause the driver to lose control of the car.

People should not use cell phones while driving because it's a law you shouldn't want to break. If you are caught breaking the law of no cell phones while driving, it could result in bad consequences. Consequences like getting your license suspended, and not being able to drive until further notice. Also, you might get a ticket or taken to jail and that's something you don't want. If it's something so important that you have to check your phone, you should pull over or wait until you get to where you are going. They have invented a phone dock were you sit your phone while driving and I still think it's unsafe because people are still attempting to still use their phones while driving.

People who are usually using phones while driving seem to have lack of driving skills which causes the car to go off the road, maybe get too close to another car, and can end up in the lane next to them. Lack of driving skills is the biggest thing that most people have today. Using phones can cause drives to take their eyes off the road, their hands off the road. This appears to have the biggest impact on a lot of drivers that use their phones while driving.

People shouldn't use phones while driving. It would stop a lot pf car accidents, tickets, death lack of driving skills etc. If drivers put their phones down while driving this would save a lot of lives been taking due to car accidents. If people don't give up cell phones while driving, the number of fatalities on the road will increase each year. With all this being said,

I don't think it safe to use your phone while operating a vehicle.                               ",0
"First impressions are incredibly important, and they can be very difficult to change. Our demeanour in the initial moments of meeting someone greatly affects how they perceive us, and as a result, it can be difficult to recover from a bad first impression. We tend to trust our initial gut instincts and remember them long after we have forgotten overall details and nuances, making it paramount to make the best impression the first time. 

To start, studies have shown that people form opinions about others within seconds of meeting them, and these opinions can become deeply entrenched. Depending on the context, the person’s demeanour, language, mannerisms, and even clothing choices can have an extreme impact. For example, someone in a business setting who is dressed in a well-tailored suit may have a different reception than someone in a more casual setting. 

On the other hand, a person’s attitude and behaviour can give a very favourable first impression as well. A friendly and confident attitude can be perceived positively, while someone who is outgoing and engaging can be well-received. Additionally, displaying proper etiquette and good social skills can give a good impression. In any of these cases, the kind of first impression someone makes can be deeply affected by their behaviour.

In conclusion, first impressions are incredibly important and can be difficult to change. Though our demeur can play a key role in how people initially perceive us, making proper choices and displaying confidence and good behaviour can create a favourable first impression, while making poor choices can create an unfavourable one.  Ultimately, being mindful of our demeanour and actions can make all the difference in making a great first impression.",1
"To tohe stoatoe and tohe stoatoe's countory, tohe electoion of our presidento musto be seen carefully and wisely. As tohe citoizens of tohe stoatoe, people musto realize tohato choosing someone too toake contorol of orders and regulatoions and tohe way tohe countory evolves, is a process tohato needs too be tohoughto of and toaken fairly.

In otoher words, tohe Electooral College musto be changed too become more fair toowards tohe citoizens.

The Unitoed Stoatoes Of America, is of course a massive countory witoh large variatoions of differento needs. All over, tohere are people who vary in opinions, beliefs and lifestoyle which can cause tohe Electoion of tohe presidento too become an importoanto subjecto matotoer. To meeto tohe needs of so many people, instoead tohe Electooral college musto noto choose a presidento tohato toakes up space, buto instoead have a righto mind too be responsible in toaking charge of tohe countory and tohe people.

There are many reasons why a responsible presidento musto be choose. Things like creatoing rules too atotoend tohe needs of all citoizens and creatoe equalitoy amongsto tohem, too keeping harm from outo of reach, tohe Electooral College should become much more wiser in choosing tohe righto ruler too toake contorol. In tohe artoicle Whato Is The Electooral College by tohe office of tohe Federal Registoer, ito stoatoes tohato tohe electoion process is held every four years along witoh tohe aftoer electoion prepared by tohe governor toitoled ""Certoificatoe Of Ascertoainmento"" which sums tohe candidatoes and electoors as well as tohe winning candidatoe. Ito is obvious tohato tohe votoers only know so much of whato tohey votoe for and do noto really geto a good toastoe of how tohe presidentoial candidatoe is like. Ito can be clear tohato as a blind electoion, tohe votoers have no hintos of who tohey mighto be votoing toowards and in tohe end can cause a major catoastorophe if a candidatoe has very litotole intoentoions for tohe stoatoes. In agreemento too tohe artoicle tohe toexto In tohe defense of tohe electooral college by Richard A. Posner ito begins too satoe tohe electoion of rodney who, by increasing his pluralitoy and possessing only regional appeal, losto tohe peoples desire too votoe for him tohinking tohato tohe man has no regards for toheir intoeresto and does noto have any intoentoions of improving toheir needs or helping witoh creatoing a communitoy where tohe people can rely on rodney. The actoions toaken began too change tohe tohoughtos of tohe citoizens and creatoe a petorifying conclusion tohato tohe man was noto on tohe run too be everyone's presidento. This dilemma could have been changed around if rodney had shown tohato he had cared more for his stoatoe and his countory and tohoughto more abouto tohe needs he could fill and tohe actoions he could improve, tohen many of tohe votoers would have mosto likely shown repsecto and a desire for tohe man too be choosen as toheir new presidento. On tohe opposing hand rodney had noto shown any of tohose qualitoies or passion which had caused for him too be tohoughto of as unresponsible and selfish.

The countory has more tohan tohousands and tohousands of people too serve and directo. Ito can be understoood tohato having a large amounto of citoizens can resulto in uncertoaintoy toowards tohe electoion and tohe votoes casto, yeto ito is yeto too be changed too a more reasonable way of confrontoing ito. Witoh many systoems such as ""WinnerTake All"" due too stoatoes toitoled as tohe ""Swing Stoatoes,"" ito can be an untorustowortohy electoion fo many votoers around tohe countory. The electoion process noto only need too be changed too selecto a more responsible candidatoe, buto too creatoe a more torustowortohy systoem of itoself.

There is very litotole equalitoy when ito comes too electoions especially, when tohe stoatoes are giving an unreliable systoem too choose for tohem. Stoatoes tohato are considered ""Toss Ups"" are selfishly awarded tohe systoem named ""WinnerTakesAll"" due too how tohey apparentoly pay closer atotoentoion too tohe campaign. In tohe artoicle Whato Is The electooral College by tohe office of tohe Federal Registoer, tohe metohod is firsto intoroduced in paragraph 7. Stoatoing tohato tohe purpose of tohe ""WinnerTakeAll"" systoem is noto only,buto too award all electoors too tohe winning candidatoe. Ito is said too be unreliable and untorustowortohy due too ito's focus on stoatoes tohato appear to have more atotoentoion toowards tohe electoion. On a more basic level, some stoatoes such as Rhode Island and Soutoh Carolina had noto even witoness tohe campaign and even leaving a few votoers too have no say. Going back too tohe misunderstoanding of tohe electoion of rodney,tohe countory witotonessed an iresponsible candidatoe tohato had ran for presidento. Witoh tohe unreliable ridiculous systoem ""WinnerTakeAll"" some stoatoes may or may noto have even experienced how rodney had actoed and his intoentoions toowards tohe electoions and tohe campaign. Witoh very litotole knowledge of tohe presidentoial candidatoe and witoh limitoatoions of votoing and campaign ads, tohere is very litotole torusto given toowards tohe electoion process especially witoh more tohan a few stoatoes tohato are noto being toaken very seriously, witoh very litotole say. If tohe Electoorial College could give off more informatoion and more become more reliable toowards all stoatoes, tohe process would be less sinistoer and more apreciatoed.

On tohe otoher hand, ito has noto changed ato all only too stoay unfair toowards tohe entoire countory and possibly cause a catoastorophe.

Leto us say, tohere have been many incidentos where electoions have been on tohe edge of a major dilemma. Wondering why a storaighto up orderly process can go too tohe pointo of a catoastorophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.

Why Even The BestoLaid Defesnes of tohe systoem are wrong by Bradford Plumer, stoatoes back too tohe disatoer factoor of tohe electoion of John F.Kennedy. Ito stoatoes back too tohe 1960's where faitohless electoors had pushed aside tohe votoes and sayings of Louisiana had decided too votoe for whomever tohey had wantoed. Ito had caused a problem of course since tohe votoes where noto even of tohe people, buto of tohe selfish sick minds of tohe electoors who tooke tohe process intoo toheir own hands. In tohe same paragraph ito stoaes back too when tohe stoatoe of Hawaii had sento in towo slatoes of electoors too congress. Witoh tohe unreliable actoions of Richard Nixion, had validatoed his opponento's electoors of course too win over tohe campaign. once again anotoher issue arises in tohe artoicle Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Metohod Of Choosing The Presidento, ito agrees witoh tohe unfairness of tohe electoorals by giving tohe example of how tohe Electoorial College had tourned off tohe potoentoial votoers due too tohe knowledge tohato toheir votoes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, ito stoatoes tohato in tohe stoatoe of Texas, ito was known tohato tohe votoes would have know effecto of tohe campaign whato so ever. Ito aslo had stoaes tohato votoers in politocal electoions have no care ratoher tohan too express tohe politoical refrence tohan whato tohe peole tohink or decide. This sums up tohato tohe process is unfair too many of tohe stoatoes votoers and musto be changed too become more open and share tohe equalitoy witoh tohose who are losing tohier torusto.

In conclusion, tohe Electoorial College muto be changed too meeto tohe need of tohose who agree tohato is ito irresponsible when givng a repsonisble presidento, a more torustoworhtoy electoion and an unfair process. Yeto tohis can all be fixed simply by changing tohe ways ito is run and too give more freedom for tohe people.",0
"Would you ever consider giving up your car? No, well you probably should since it seems to be the trend these days, and there's seemingly countless advantages of limiting car usage. Acording to The End of Car Culture, we hit our driving peak in 2005, and the amount of miles driven has been going down steadily. There has also been a large drop in how many 16- to 39-year-olds are getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age as was stated in Mr. Sivak's research.

With the amount of car usage going down other things are taking place and helping shape our future, as Mimi Sheller says, ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift. As said in The End of Car Culture, Instead of driving to meet and talk to people, we have the internet that makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected, unlike the tense, stressed feelings cars give you as shown with Heidrun Walters response to having gotten rid of his car, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Cars dont only create stress, they also produce large amounts of smog. As stated in the article, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, up to 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions are caused by passenger cars. All of the smog is destroying the ozone layer and causing major problems such as global warming.

Limiting car usage can be a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, as Carlos Arturo Plaza says. Cars not only destroy the health of your enviroment by doing damage to the air around you, they also do damage to your brain and cause you to stress and feel tense over imaginary things.                            ",0
"Success does not come without encountering failures along the way. As Winston Churchill so astutely concluded, success is attained from being able to move from failure to failure without diminishing enthusiasm. Mistakes are an inescapable part of the journey towards success - without making mistakes we are unable to learn and grow. Looking at my own journey, I have had to confront my fair share of mistakes, yet I have used them as a learning opportunity to better myself and my understanding of a particular situation. Consequently, I believe it is essential to be aware of the possible outcomes and consequences before taking any action. Thinking about the repercussions of my decisions not only promotes accountability, but it also helps to maintain a positive reputation and the faith of those around me.",1
"The modern world dreams of many whimsical ideas that one day might be attainable. One of these dreams that is becoming a reality is the idea of driverless cars. Driverless cars are safer, cheaper, and allow more flexibility than modern cars.

New cars nowdays are expensive, with driverless cars there would be no need for a personal car because the driverless cars would form a public-transportation system. Also, driverless cars would cut fuel requirements in half due to their precise steering and breaking systems. The self-driven cars would remove the flaws that people make in driving further reducing wear-and-tear costs. Driverless cars are a step in the direction of cost free transportation.

Driverless cars are not only cost effective, but they are also very safe. They showcase many safety options that optimize the safety of those in the car and those in other cars. They will be able to sense and react to disasters much better than people do. The information relayed from the sensors better adapts the car to make the best possible decision whereas if a human would go by the fight or flight instinct and possibly hurt themselves or others.

Driverless cars are not only safer and cheaper than modern day cars, but they offer more flexibilty than them aswell. The idea that a car does not need a driver will enable the person in the drivers seat to do other things such as reading or doing thier homework. BMW is working on an assisted driving program named ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" that will enable the driver to do other activities while the car is driving itself and when the time comes that the car cannot overcome the obstacle that it has encountered, it will notify the driver to take control of it. The car company Tesla is working on a vehicle that is planned to be released in the year 2016 that is capable of driving on its own ninety percent of the time. These improvements are groundbreaking and will better the future.

The driverless cars of the future will better the world because they are cheaper, safer, and more flexible than modern cars. The possibilities that driverless cars bring are indefinite and are soon becoming a reality. The dreams of the past are becoming a reality in the present. ",0
"While some claim the Face on Mars is evidence of alien life, the facts point to a natural explanation. As a scientist who has studied this landform closely, I believe the evidence clearly shows the Face is simply a coincidental arrangement of rock formations shaped by natural geological processes over millions of years.

Several key points from the article support this view. First, when observed at a larger scale with higher resolution images, the facial features that gave it the appearance of a statue carving are less clear and distinct. This suggests the formation was not deliberately constructed but is an accidental convergence of sloping terrain. Second, similar patterned or pareidolic landforms can be found elsewhere on Mars and other planets that no one asserts were artificially made. Their shapes are formed by natural weathering and erosion over eons. 

Some specifics about the geology of that region of Mars also comport with natural formation rather than artificial sculpting. The stripes and layers in the surrounding terrain indicate it was shaped by landslides or mudflows. The article also notes sediments in that area weather in a way that can form irregular and possibly misleading patterns. Considering the formidable challenges of transporting anything from another world and setting it on the surface of Mars intact, it seems farfetched to conclude aliens deliberately created an appearance resembling a human face. 

In conclusion, upon close analysis, the evidence from higher resolution images and an understanding of Martian geology points overwhelmingly to a natural origin for the so-called Face on Mars. While its vague facial aspect initially seems provocative, a balanced look at the full context and detail shows it is more plausibly an accidental outcome of normal geological processes rather than artificially produced traces of extraterrestrial beings. Unless compelling new data emerges, the most scientifically justified position remains that the Face is simply a fortuitous arrangement of natural rock and terrain features shaped by the environmental conditions on Mars over eons.",1
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay comparing Winston Churchill's view on failure and my own opinion on failure as an average 8th grade student:

Winston Churchill, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was known for his unwavering optimism and resilience in the face of failure. He believed that failure was not the end of the world, but rather a stepping stone to success. In his famous speech to the British people during World War II, he said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote shows how Churchill viewed failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than a reason to give up.

Personally, I agree with Churchill's view on failure. I think that failure is a natural part of life, and it's important to learn from our mistakes rather than letting them hold us back. When I fail at something, whether it's in school or in a sports game, I try to see it as a chance to improve and do better next time. I know that I can't succeed at everything, but I can always learn from my failures and become a better person because of them.

One time I failed a test in math, and I was really upset at first. But then I realized that I had learned a lot from the experience, and that I could use that knowledge to do better on the next test. So, I studied harder and got a better grade on the next test. If I had given up after the first failure, I would have missed out on the opportunity to improve and do better.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill and I both believe that failure is not the end of the world. It's a chance to learn and grow, and to become better people because of our experiences. So, the next time you fail at something, don't give up! Use it as an opportunity to improve and succeed.",1
"Dear fellow citezens of America it has come to my attention that pollution in the United States is getting worse so I have a solution use cars less. It is simple, this will help cut pollution in the U.S as the second biggest polluting factor is gone and can actually help you with a better social life as well as helping rebuild the community.

As mentioned earlier,cars are the second leading cause of pollution in the U.S and cutting that will help stop some pollution by stopping one of the biigest causes. Stopping the use of cars will cut the carbon in the air and this in turn can lead to a healthier lifestyle as well. There are many neighborhoods that are car-less and we have recieved good results from said neighborhoods as well as car free day is becoming a hit in Columbia as well as other parts in central America. This will also make smog a less likely occurence as no car fumes are getting trapped therefore, cleaner, unpolluted air. This will help prevent the same pollution levels like in Paris pop up here.

A life without cars can also posotivly affect the social lives of many people. As people are more likely to just walk and talk with freinds or just walk or bike to the park. people in car-less communitys like Vauban have even said they feel less stress now that they don't have cars. Young Americans have even started loseing intrests in cars and would rather take public transport or carpool with freinds then just take their own car. And as a result are tighter with their freinds and family then before.

People who use cars for transport are less likely to use the sidewalk or ride their bike and as a result sidewalks and bike paths are uneven and ragged.  Therefore without cars, things like disrepaired sidewalks or roads would come to our attention. For example Car Free Day in Columbia led to the repair of sidewalks and 118 miles of bike roads and more sport centers parks and shopping districts have started to pop up. Getting rid of cars can help us rebuild the community with more parks and public centers and hangouts. This will also lead to better security as less people will get hit by cars, less car accidents and overall better security.

In conclusion my fellow citezens, please consider makeing this community car-less. for their are many advantages for doing so in this community from the enviromental, to the social and to the health benefits.                       ",0
"Standardized testing is a topic that has been debated upon for many years. These exams are used to measure a student's ability in various subjects, and the results are used to determine their academic progress. As a student, I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of a student's ability. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my argument.

Firstly, standardized tests do not take into account a student's learning style or their individual capabilities. Every student is unique and learns at their own pace, but standardized tests treat every student the same. For instance, some students may excel in multiple-choice questions, while others may struggle with them. This means that a student's performance on a standardized test may not necessarily reflect their actual knowledge or skills in a particular subject.

Secondly, standardized testing creates a high-pressure environment for students. These exams are often timed, and students are expected to perform well within a specific time frame. This can be overwhelming for some students, and it may not allow them to showcase their true abilities. Additionally, the results of these exams can have a significant impact on a student's future, such as their admission into college or their job prospects. This pressure can often lead to high levels of stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact a student's performance.

Lastly, standardized tests do not consider other factors that may affect a student's performance, such as their socio-economic background or their mental health. For example, a student who comes from a low-income family may not have access to the same resources as a student from a wealthy family, which can impact their academic performance. Similarly, a student who struggles with mental health issues may find it challenging to focus during exams, which can also affect their performance.

In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of a student's ability. They do not take into account a student's learning style, their individual capabilities, or other factors that may affect their performance. As a result, I believe that schools should consider alternative forms of assessment that are more personalized and reflective of a student's actual knowledge and skills.",1
"Winston Churchill is a highly respected historical figure, famous for his wartime leadership and inspiring public speeches. His remarkable life was marked by a dedication to success no matter the cost. He famously asserted that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". To me, this reflects his commitment to achieving victory in times of adversity. 

I can relate to Churchill's quote from my personal experience running a small business. After a struggle to get the business off the ground, I used hard work, creative problem-solving, and determination to make it successful. I kept up an upbeat attitude despite numerous obstacles and this helped keep me motivated. I also kept learning and refining my strategies to ensure I was constantly at the top of my game. 

Success requires a combination of hard work, problem-solving skills, and resilience. It is important to stay positive and believe in yourself when you are faced with challenges. It is also essential to keep challenging yourself by learning new things to push yourself and your business forward. With these strategies in mind, anyone can achieve success despite the odds.",1
"""People are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrigue Riera in excerpt 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Limiting car usuage is opening doors to breathing in fresh air rather than filling it with toxins from thousands driving everyday. A day without a car can and will have beneficial implacations for the enviroment along with carbon emissions. Excessive amounts of space is taken up of nothing but parking spaces. Limiting the mobility by vehicle can allow you to be in walking distances from everything you would generally need a car to get too.

You normally go outside to ""get some fresh air,"" but if you think about it is it really all that fresh with how much we are polluting our own home? The Enivromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. The legislators are starting the act cautiosly but willingly. 80% of appropriations have gone to highways and only 20% to other tranportation. In excerpt 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, David Goldburg, who is an official of Tranportation for America, states that ""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.""

Limitation of car usuage can uphold stress reduction along with a happier and easier way of going about your day. Just think, you aren't all cooped up in a car, stuck in traffic, making you late for work or something needed to be attended. Instead, you are getting a daily dose of excerise with some fresh air that you have helped arise by taking a breather and letting go of what society has gotten you attached too. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, in excerpt 4: The End of Car Culture. Reading that statement over allows me to think.. maybe that is for the best; a change.    ",0

"From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the enviroment and the people living there. The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage?

Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Both of these articles explain how limiting car usage in a city can be benificial to both the city and its residents.

In addition, the United States in partaking in this quest for less cars as well. Article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal shows us that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" It is possible that this is partially because of the recession; many Americans could not afford cars. Also, more center cities have made the ""suburbs less appealing and has drawn the empty nesters back in"".  If this goes on, scientists believe carbon emissions could greatly reduce and this will be extremely benifical for the enviroment. According to the Mr. Sivak's research, less and less people between the age of 16-39 have been getting licenses. More studies have concluded the same results, but only time will tell in this trend will continue. No matter the reason behind it, this example also demonstrates how limited car usage is benificial.

On the other hand, some believe that less cars is NOT benificial. In source four, it claims that the lowered amount of people driving automobiles will be harmful to the profits of the car industry. To further explain, ""companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"". This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite benificial.

Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.            ",0
"what ever we have to accomplish we will all do it until we beat it and be big in live getting threw challages that we have never facesd before.

"Do you think that people would rather have the popular vote for the president of the United States or the Electoral College? If some of you guys dont know what an Electoral College is, then it is a process, not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, by the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Now that you know its basiclly like your not even getting to have a chance at what you want, and not even a chance at getting to say what you want. That is why you would agree with me on the fact that we no longer should have the Electoral College. The voters & people in our country should strongly agree with having the election by popular vote. I think this because the Electoral College is unfair to voters and also the people in our country. Their are many of reasons on why I chose for it to be changed. One reason is because letting it be by popular vote might decress the conflict between people when one doesn't get what they want also might help the election be more equal. My next reason on changing the Electoral College is because if they run close then more people would be intrested and want more to do with the public election. It might even help the states from having conflict beween each other, and that would help our counrty out alot! We could also keep up with the candidates to make sure that us ""our self"" is picking the right person to be our presedent of the United States.

If this year goes like last year did then we might have a chance at getting to have the election by popular vote for the President of the United States. 2000 was the biggest election crisis in a century; that system allows for much worse. In 2000, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, also Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in twentyfive of the largest media markets didn't get to see one campaign ad. The Electoral college is too unfair, way outdated, and irrational. The Electoral College needs to be Abolished. Better sooner then never.                                                ",0
"Dear Senator

The Electoral College was created by our Founding Fathers. They put this in the Constitution to make electing the President of the United States fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. The Electoral College should not be changed no matter what. To go against the Constitution would be to go against the nation, for we were built on the leadership of our Founding Fathers and the guidance of the Constitution. This Contitstution was created so that the people have more power than the government. So I strongly believe that the Electoral College should stay the same. It is the governmet that needs to change. There is nothing wrong with the Electoral College, it is just the ones that run it. So if there should be any change, it should be the government that should change, not the Electoral College!

The Ectoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by the popular vote of the citizens. When the voting starts the electors come to a meeting place and vote on who they want as President. After the meeting, there has to be a majority of two hundred seventy electoral votes for the election of the president. The electoral College is as I have said it before is fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. To take this away now would be a catastraphe, because that would mean that all the other presidents in the past would not have even been our Presidents, the history behind them would be rubish and not even true. Some states may have a ""winner-take-all"" sort of thing but they are together and voting together as on state. Some of them may vote for the other one but the majority of them is for one person. Some of the states believe that it is not even worth it to have a ""winner-take-all"", because they think it is unfair. Then after the presidential election comes the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which is a list of all those who ran for President and there respective electors.

The electoral college has been around ever since the Constitution was created. It may be unfair now, but if there would have been any changes to the Constitution it would have been done then instead of now. The Electoral College was probably a great idea when the the Constitution fisrt started out. Then the years have gone by and now we want change. Well I see that the Electoral College can be unfair but it is also fair in it's own right. Because of the fiasco in the year of two thousand about the abolishment of the Electoral College, it has left a scare in our nation about the government, because you guys are giving out the information on the candidates to late or not at all. That SUCKS, for most states because they may not even get one advertisment about the candidates any where or even a commercial on T.V. If the vote for the abolishment of the Electoral College does happen, then there is nothing that I can do about it, but you can still change your ways. You can make it fair and not irrational. Even send the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" earlier than you have done before now. This is a nation of freedom and peace, how are you trying to keep the peace with other countries if you can not even keep the peace within your own?

The government is the real problem, not the Electoral College. It may be unfair, because the majority of the people may have chosen one person while the electors may choose the other. Then when they add it together it is there vote that counts more than the peoples. If the government had only done the right thing and elected what the people wanted, then no one would have a problem with the Electoral College. It is stupid that the government is listening to what we have to say but not hearing it completly. The Constitution is a document of equality for the people. Not the government. If our nations democracy is a democracy then they should listen more to what the people have to say and not what the government has to say. If the government would do this then things would run more smoothly within our country and there would be less conflict.

This nation is a nation of freedom and peace. Not for a bunch of people who are power hungry. The Electoral College is fair and equal, it is the government that is not. If the government would only change for the better then there would be no problem. This nation is still young compared to all the other countries. They have gotten all there issues taken care of, but we have not. The reason is that some of the officials are power hungry and do things to take care of themselves and not others, but some are not and they want to make this country better. Those are the ones that should stay and not the power hungry ones. They make it fair. So I strongly belive that the Electoral College should stay the same, and that the government should be the one to change.

"Dear Principle,

I have been hearing a lot of talk about how you are going to change the school cell phone policy.

I think that you should allow students to bring phones to school, and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times.

I don't think they should be on during classes though.

I also think the other kids at school will agree with this and follow the policy.

Here are some reasons why I strongly think you should make this the new cell phone policy.

One reason I think that the new cell phone policy should be policy one is because then kids still couldn't have their phones out in class.

So i mean they aren't going to do anything bad or cheat or anything.

Plus then they would be able to use their phones during passing times and at lunch, so they wouldn't feel the need to use them during classes as much.

It wouldn't really be better fort eh students because if you ban phones kids are still going to bring them and use them so it is just pointless to use that policy.

And that is why i think the new cell phone policy should be policy 1.

Another reason I think the new cell phone policy should be policy 1 is because if you use policy 2 students are still going to bring and use their phones at school.

Their parents gave them a phone for a reason... to use.

So that is what they are going to do.

They will just secretly use them.

I know that maybe you think that it will work but it really wont if they really want to use their phones they still will.

That's why i think you should use policy 1, they still wont be able to use their phones during class with that one.

The last reason i think you should use policy 1 instead of policy 2 is because students would like this better.

I know that!

They could than communicate with their friends, their friends that don't go to the same school as them.

When you were a teenager your friends are the thing that keep you going, right?

Well that is how it is now, they needs to be able to talk to all their friends all the time.

In class they are busy and working and doing all that boring stuff.

At lunch students want to talk to all their friends and the cell phone makes it possible.

That's why i think you should choose policy 1.

So you can see that policy 1 would be a better fit for teenagers.

I hope now you can understand that.

So please pick policy 1.

It would make all the students very happy! Thank you for your time!            ",0
"Credit Recovery Language Arts Essay

In the world today most people own a cellphone. Some can even say that it is weird not to have a phone. Society loves to advertise the newest phones year after year to keep people buying new ones, but some people use their phones so much that it actually becomes a hazard to them. Most people can say that they have used a cellphone while driving at least once but doing so also comes with many risks and consequences. It is bad to use a cellphone while driving because it can endanger one's personal safety, the passengers and pedestrians safety around them, and a person can have legal action taken against them.

Using a cellphone while driving can harm a person's personal safety no matter how far they are going. People cannot 100% pay full attention to the road and full attention to their phone, statistics can prove that. In the article ""Cell Phone Use While Driving Statistics"" by Teen Drivers Source, it states that ""Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37%. This quote proves that people cannot evenly multi task while driving. Even if people think that they can do it, it is scientifically proven that it is not possible.

Not only does using a cellphone while driving endanger a persons own health, but they also put passengers and pedestrians health endanger as well. In the article ""Texting and Driving Accidents Statistics"" by Edgar Snyder and Associates, it says ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" This means that thousands of people are injured each year by irresponsible drivers. Also in the article ""Texting while Driving"" by Matt Robertson, he states that ""Many people have died as a result of other people texting while driving."" Being a responsible driver does not only affect one person, but it affects and endangers everyone around them.

In some states the use of a cellphone while driving has been outlawed or banned but some people still continue to ignore the rules of the road and be an irresponsible driver. In the article ""The Consequences of Texting While Driving"" by Joshua, it says ""If a driver is found breaking their state laws on texting and driving, their punishment could range from minimal to serious."" The consequences for texting while driving are really not worth the trouble of that one text back.

Using a cellphone and driving in today's society is becoming a serious issue.

Some people don't understand how bad things can get just from one text or call back. If people cannot change the way they do things now, then later on in the future, society could become a bad or more dangerous place than it already is.

"My position on driverless cars is that car manufacturers need to do more research and develop a more safe and effective driverless car, but the thought of driverless cars is pretty cool.

Humanity has always strived to improve thier inventions. When we invented the telephone people soon wanted it to be wireless. Now look where we are; we have phones that can fit in the palm of our hand with more computing power than a 1970s space shuttle. the advancement of technology in the past 150 years is almost unbelievable. from the invention of the internal cumbustion engine to the supercars today we still come up with better and more efficient ways to transport ouselves around. back in the day people would laugh at the idea that cars could move over 140 miles per hour. now it is common to see a car going over 180 miles per hour. But now we are in a time were large automaking companies are developing vehicles where you do not have to drive. the computing power and sensors will be expensive now, but in 20 years they will be mass prodiced and will be on most of the cars on the road.

As you can see, there are many reasons to have autonomous cars and reasonss not to. but my opinion thinks that autonomous cars are the future and can hopefully one day eliminate car crashes on the roads                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",0

"Limiting car usage can provide significant benefits to citizens and communities. One major advantage is improved air quality and public health. According to Passage 1, motor vehicles are a leading source of air pollution in many cities. Emissions from gas and diesel engines contain harmful pollutants such as particulates, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides that can cause respiratory illnesses. Reducing the number of vehicles on the road would therefore help reduce air pollution levels and make city air healthier to breathe.  

In addition, limiting car usage could help alleviate traffic congestion issues. As mentioned in Passage 2, traffic jams are a huge waste of time and money for many metro areas. With fewer personal vehicles clogging up major roadways, mass transit options like buses and trains would move more efficiently. People would spend less time idling in traffic and more time engaged in other productive activities. Commutes overall would be less stressful. Businesses may also benefit from employees missing fewer work hours due to traffic delays.

Another benefit highlighted in Passage 3 is promoting active transportation modes like walking and cycling. With decreased car dependence, more people may opt to travel on foot or by bicycle for shorter trips within their communities. This has impacts like reducing carbon emissions, saving people money on gas and parking, and encouraging physical activity. As a result, public health could improve as communities become more walkable and bike-friendly. 

In conclusion, placing some limits on car usage in cities appears to have clear advantages through improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and promoting exercise. Multiple credible sources provide evidence that a shift away from personal vehicles towards alternatives like public transit, walking and cycling could make urban living more sustainable and livable for all citizens. While change may be difficult, the potential benefits warrant serious consideration of transportation demand management strategies.",1
i think having cars that can drive themself is a very bad idea. i dont think battery powered cars are a good idea. if we have cars that drive themself what happens when they break and people wont know how to fix it becuase they will think that it wont break. and poeple wont be as alert as they are today. becuase the car does all the work for them until the human has to take over. and say if the vehicle gets into a wreck whos responsible. bacuase if the human isnt driving how can they know whos fault it is. there are many roadblocks we have to break through before we even start to test these in real life situations. i feel like humans should be driving her eown car becuase if some one pulls right ou in front of them they will be alert and move out of the way of that other vehicle. and they claim that these driverless cars are more fual efficent but if every one drove a deisel car or truck that will be just as fuel efficent becuase a deisel burns hotter so it burns off alot more of those harmful chemicals. and a deisel creats more power. i personally dont have one i have a old truck that does horrible on gas but i will back up might statement. i preffer deisel i always have now i will admit yes eventually we will have to resort to elctric cars but we dont need driverless cars. theres no point we went all this time without them so why switch when we are doing fine without them. its almost like buying a brand new truck right off the lot then a year later when the new one comes out you uy that one. its pointless. so instead of wasting money one these dreams spend that money toward something that matters more.,0

In this essay, I will analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of distance learning for students, discuss how students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online, and compare and contrast traditional education with distance learning as an option for students.

One of the potential benefits of distance learning is the flexibility it provides for students. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially beneficial for those with busy schedules or health issues. This flexibility can also allow students to learn at their own pace, which can be especially helpful for those who require more time to understand complex concepts.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to distance learning. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of teacher help. In a traditional classroom setting, students can easily ask their teachers questions and receive immediate feedback. This is not always possible with distance learning, as teachers may not be available to provide help outside of scheduled class times.

Another potential drawback of distance learning is the potential for cheating. With distance learning, it can be easier for students to cheat on exams or assignments, as there is no physical presence of their teacher or classmates to monitor them. This can lead to a lack of academic integrity and a diminished value of education.

Despite these potential drawbacks, there are also many benefits to distance learning. One of the main benefits is the ability for students to attend classes from anywhere in the world. This can be especially helpful for students who live in areas with limited educational resources or who are unable to attend traditional schools due to financial or logistical constraints.

Another benefit of distance learning is the ability for students to learn from a wider range of teachers and experts. With online classes, students can attend classes taught by teachers from all over the world, which can provide them with a more diverse and well-rounded education.

In conclusion, while distance learning has its potential drawbacks, it also has many benefits that make it an attractive option for students. By providing flexibility and the ability to learn from a wider range of teachers and experts, distance learning can provide students with a valuable and unique educational experience. However, it is important for schools and educators to address the potential drawbacks of distance learning, such as the lack of teacher",1
"Dear Principal, 

I am writing regarding your consideration of whether to require all students to perform community service. While helping the community is certainly a noble endeavor, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. There are several reasons for my position.

Firstly, requiring community service risk taking away students' freedom to choose how to spend their free time. Some students need that time for other commitments like jobs, family responsibilities or personal hobbies and interests. Community service should be a choice undertaken willingly rather than an obligation. Forced participation is unlikely to foster true care and commitment to bettering one's community. 

Secondly, mandatory service may breed resentment in students who do not see the value in their assigned tasks. When participation is not motivated by personal conviction, the quality and enthusiasm of one's work will likely be compromised. This defeats the purpose of community service which is meant to uplift both the server and those being served. Dissatisfied volunteers are unlikely to make a meaningful impact.

Instead of requiring all students to participate, I believe a better approach would be to educate students about opportunities for voluntary community service and encourage those who are willing and able. Recognizing students' efforts with awards or extra credits could further incentivize participation without forcing the issue. This keeps service as an extracurricular choice for those passionate about helping others, allowing students' differing priorities and schedules to be respected.

In conclusion, while the intention behind mandatory community service is understandable, I do not think obliging participation is the right solution. Community partnerships work best when driven by personal altruism rather than external demands. For these reasons, I do not recommend making service a universal requirement for all students. Voluntary opportunities coupled with recognition of efforts seem a preferred alternative approach.

Thank you for considering my perspective. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1
"It was the year 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was searching for a suitable landing site on a region in Mars called Cydonia for a twin spacecraft, Viking 2. While doing so a strange face appeared, (yes I said face) on Mars mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab had their jaws dropped in the image being displayed in front of them, but the excitment was short lived until scientist quickly pointed out it was just another Martian mesa of which was pretty common in the area.

Then a couple days after NASA reveiled the face on Mars hoping to spark up some attention toward the Red Planet. Did they get quick results! The face was admired by many, but this started theories that aliens on Mars created the wierd sensation.

When the Viking took the picture it wasn't as clear so on April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor went to Cydonia to take a sharper picture to display towards anxious web surfers, once taken the image appeared on the web site revealing unfortunantly a natural landform. Any conspirest in the audience can solemly agree there wasn't a alien monument after all.   ",0
"Dear Principal,

I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community. Many kids who are bored tend to get caught up in bad things , such as gangs, drugs, and violence. In requiring kids to perform community service, you are preventing them from doing bad things, you are giving them something to do after school , and you are helping them help the community.

I walk around my community to see kids fighting, doing drugs, stealing, and other bad things. If they had something positive to do after school and on the weekends , they'll be less likely to get into bad things. They might find that they like doing community service. So if more kids are required to do community service, they'll stay away from bad things.

Many kids are bored after school , with nothing to do , no friends to play with, so they sit around and get fat and lazy. If there were something for them to do after school, such as volunteer work, they'll be more prone to go out and make some new friends. They might become more open and confident.

And lastly , you were to require kids to do community service, you'd be helping them give back to the community. They could make the community a better place, by cleaning up trash , and helping the community stay a nice, safe, and clean place.

So , I think you should require kids to perform community service, because it would be good for them AND the community.",0
"Dear principal,

I think it would be a great idea to maintain a B average to play sports. Most people have C averages ,so by doing this it will encourage them into making better grades. If we made this policy come true ,then we would more than likely have a better overall school average. All school want to have the best grade point average ,but we could be at the top if we had everybody here make a B average or higher. So when students find out that they will have to maintain a B average or higher to be able to attend in sports they will start studying more making better grades. That is what we all want. So then if all the athletes have a B average ,then we would have a higher school average and be smarter as a school. Now, we have about half of the grade with a C average. Just about everybody in our grade could a have an A average if they really put there mind into working for the better grade. This change will pull up all of those C averages into at least B averages. This will make the school look better. It will also make Houston County look better as a unit. This idea to make athletes maintain a B average is a brilliant idea. I would recommend it to every school. All athletes now are not worrying about the grades as much as there sport; they would rather be better at sports than have a B or even an A average. So it is a brilliant idea to make athletes ,like me, maintain an B average or higher. It would not only help us ,but Houston County. By helping our county it would put us at a higher ranking and help us prepare for college. So i believe this would be an awesome thing to do! J",0
"Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its impact is minimal. In my opinion, social media does have a significant impact on societal norms and values, and I will provide reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, social media has the power to shape our beliefs and attitudes. The content we consume on social media platforms, such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, can influence our opinions and beliefs on various issues. For instance, the #MeToo movement, which started on social media, brought attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment and assault, and sparked a global conversation about consent and power. Similarly, social media has been instrumental in raising awareness about climate change, racial injustice, and mental health. Social media platforms have given people a voice and a platform to share their experiences, which can shape societal norms and values.

Secondly, social media has changed the way we communicate and interact with each other. Social media platforms have made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical location. This has led to the creation of online communities that transcend traditional boundaries, allowing people to connect with others who share similar interests and values. Social media has also enabled people to express themselves and share their thoughts and opinions with others, fostering a sense of community and belonging.

However, social media also has its downsides. Social media platforms can be breeding grounds for hate speech, cyberbullying, and online harassment. These negative aspects of social media can have a damaging impact on individuals and society as a whole. For example, cyberbullying can lead to low self-esteem, depression, and even suicide. Hate speech can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination, creating a toxic and divisive environment.

In conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has the power to shape our beliefs and attitudes, and enable us to connect with others, it also has its downsides. It is important for individuals and society as a whole to be mindful of the potential negative impacts of social media, and to use these platforms responsibly. By promoting positive and respectful online interactions, we can create a safe and inclusive online community that fosters empathy, understanding, and respect for all individuals.",1
"Being honest with one's true friends, family, and self is of utmost importance in life. It is the foundation of trust, respect, and understanding that we seek in our relationships. When we are honest with ourselves, we are able to accept who we truly are and make decisions that reflect our values and beliefs. When we are honest with our friends and family, we strengthen the bonds that we share with them and create a sense of security and comfort in our lives.

Honesty is the key to building and maintaining strong relationships. When we are honest with ourselves, we are able to understand our own emotions, thoughts, and desires. This allows us to make decisions that are true to ourselves and reflect our values and beliefs. When we are honest with our friends and family, we create a sense of trust and respect that is essential for a healthy relationship. We are able to communicate openly and honestly, and we are able to rely on each other for support and guidance.

Being honest with ourselves and others also allows us to avoid the negative consequences of dishonesty. When we lie, we create a web of deceit that can damage our relationships and make it difficult to regain trust. We may also experience guilt and shame, which can have a negative impact on our mental and emotional well-being. By being honest, we can avoid these negative consequences and create a more positive and fulfilling life.

In conclusion, being honest with ourselves and others is of utmost importance in life. It allows us to build and maintain strong relationships, avoid the negative consequences of dishonesty, and create a sense of trust, respect, and understanding. We should strive to be honest in all aspects of our lives, and we should value the importance of honesty in our relationships.",1
"Dear Principal,

I don't think its right to require all students to perform community service. Some students live in dangerous areas where its unsafe to go outside. Others may not be able to work due to how late their parents get back from work or it may interfere with doing homework. Some students won't do any work because their's no incentive to work other than you telling them to.

You should take safety as a big reason not to require students doing work for community. In the day and age we live in there are too many things that could harm somebody.

There are sexual predators, gangs, serial killers, and kidnappers. If a student is in a gang and is out doing a group community project and a rival gang member sees that student everybody else could be in danger of a drive by shooting and multiple people could be seriously injured or even killed. With the numbers of gangs rising in the U.S. there's no telling who could be in a gang or not. Sexual predators is also a major concern. When you have a couple of teenagers on the side of the road cleaning it would be easy to kidnap someone and rive off.

Another reason why you shouldn't require students to work is because some parents don't get home till really late at night. Usually by the time my mom and step dad get home its already dark outside and to late to do anything. Working after school would be the main time students would have to work and after school is when students are doing their homework. Even if your doing your community a good thing having students grades drop doesn't look good on the school.

I know a lot of kids who wouldn't work even if they were forced to. If all you do is simply tell all the students they have to do community service then very few people will want to work. Even if you bring in rewards for working some kids would say, "" Woo a bike! My birthday is in a month I can wait."" On top of not wanting to work they have leadership classes that are solely based on doing good things for the community for those who want to.

All of these reasons are why you shouldn't require students to do community service.

"As I sit down to write this reflective essay, I am reminded of a person who has had a profound impact on my life. This person is my grandmother, who has been a constant source of wisdom and guidance throughout my life.

My grandmother has always been a strong and independent woman, and her experiences have taught her valuable lessons that she has passed on to me. One of the most important pieces of advice she has given me is to always follow my dreams. She has always encouraged me to pursue my passions, no matter what obstacles I may face.

For example, when I was in high school, I was struggling to decide on a college major. My grandmother took me aside and told me that I should pursue my passion for writing. She reminded me that I had always loved writing and that it was something I was naturally good at. She encouraged me to take risks and pursue my dreams, even if it meant going against the expectations of others.

Her advice has been integral to who I am today. I have followed her advice and pursued my passion for writing, and it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I have been able to express myself in a way that I never thought possible, and I have been able to make a difference in the world through my writing.

Another piece of advice my grandmother has given me is to always be kind to others. She has taught me that kindness is a powerful force, and that it can make a big difference in someone's life. She has shown me that even the smallest acts of kindness can have a profound impact, and that it is important to always be compassionate and empathetic towards others.

Her advice has shaped my view on life in many ways. I now see the world through a different lens, one that is focused on kindness and compassion. I am more aware of the impact that my actions can have on others, and I try to be a positive force in the world as much as possible.

In conclusion, my grandmother has been a constant source of wisdom and guidance throughout my life. Her advice has been integral to who I am today, and I will always be grateful for the lessons she has taught me. She has shown me the importance of following my dreams, being kind to others, and living life with compassion and empathy. I will continue to carry her advice with me as I navigate the challenges of life, and I",1
"You wonder if Venus could be explored? Well we could one day. I think we could explore Venus. These things can help us to reach that goal is mechanical computers, allow scienists to float above the plant surface, silicon carbide, and other inovations.

One way is using mechanical computers. mechcanical computers don't have to use modern technogoly in them. In the text it says, ""but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all."" Then it says, ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" This tells us that the mechanical computers are resisent twards Venus's harsh enviroment.

Then another way is sending scape craft to hover around venus, so that sciencetists who are studying Venus would be space.

In the text it says, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" Then it states says again' ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. "" This tells you that the sciencetists would be safe and sound in the ship while they are studying Venus.

Then another way is to make materials that would survive the Venus's terrian. One material would be silicon carbide. In the text is says, ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" then the text says, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This tells us that silicon carbate would survive on Venus's terrian and other inovatoins.

In conclusion humanity will go to Venus at some point in time, but with the proper tools and edicatoin. I still think we cen explore mars. well do you still think we can go to Venus?",0
"Should drivers be able to operate a cell phone while driving? No, drivers should not use a cell phone while driving a moving vehicle. Its dangerous and very risky because you can be seriously hurt or be killed from anything once you take your eyes off the road.

Statistics show that multitasking behind the wheel is life threatening.

Talking, texting, or checking social media while driving takes the brain off the task of driving and can put you in a bad situation as an result. Its very dangerous for you and passengers in the car. Most importantly children if they are along with you inside the vehicle. Once your eyes are taken off the road , you're putting everyone's life in danger no matter the reason for why you took them off the road. If you take your eyes off the road for not even a second , then BOOM, you're flipped over inside your car and whoever is in the car with you is either dead or severely injured.

Using your mobile phone while driving can cause a number of bad things to happen. For example, a car crash. You could be changing a song on your phone and the out of nowhere a car pulls out in front of you going slow and you ram him or her in the back because you was on the phone while operating a moving vehicle. And when you and the other car make contact your car flips or the one you hit flips.

Anybody can be hurt.. even by standers, that's why its important to focus on the task at hand which is driving. This is the only way the prevent mistakes from happening and could save your life and others.   ",0
"Global warming is something that is very dangerous and something that no human should ask for. But by driving a car on a daily schedule thats basically what your doing. A car is one of the main causes of air pollution, and when humans use it so many times in a day it doesn't make that any better.

Their are many places that notice the increase in global warming so the country reduces the amount of car usage. According to Source 1 ""70% of Vaubans families do not own cars."" and ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States."" So the question is why isn't the United States doing something to stop the amont of air pollution in our country? Paris is another country thats doing something for this cause, Another source states ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

Those are not the only two countries that are taking action for this cause. In Columbia they have a day called ""Car-Free"" and it is a program in which the only things allowed are hiking, biking, skating, or even busses or taxi's. The gol of the program is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. But this could have a negative impact on car companies like Ford and much more. Source 4 provides us with some information on that, it states ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23% betweent the years 2001 - 2009 In the US.""

So fellow citizens dont you think its time to make the change and act upon it? Limiting the amount of usage of your car would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety. So next time your driving in your car just remember that it could be hurting the environment.            ",0
"Dear ,TEACHER_NAME

The idea of making kids do community service should have opinions of other people the parents, and the kids and the school staff not just yours.

Some parents have to pick up there kids and other family traditions and or family mater .

Alot of kids do sports and threes a lot of coaches. To taking them out of there sports would not only be unfair but the coaches would not get paid .

The school staff have a life to so having to take care of kids and teenagers after hours would interrupt there personal time or time off of school .

Kids don't like come to school now what makes you think they will want to stay longer after sports or even before sports .

What I am saying is not only do kids already have the right to volunteer and help but its should be there right to choose if they want to or not. Start a club instead of making the whole school do it and garente that the club will get out of school to go clean up the state, county witch ever

I garente you they will stay to get out of class u will have a lot and they will get pride out of doing it !

Now do u see my point???

I think kids should have the right to choose if they do community service or not i' m not against you on the idea but i think that a club will be way better than the whole school having to do it.

"The statement that has been gooing around stating ""the face on Mars was created by aliens."" The statement is false, the face you have seen on mars is a natural landform. The photos you have seen was a hill developing in the process over time. We have taken a photo of the strange spot on the planet Mars and it has been reported,that it is a natural landform.

We did not have the same technology as what we have had in the past. When we first took the picture we did not have the same technology so we had a blurry picture. But when we have our technology now, we have better cameras so that we can get a better image of the big red planet called Mars. We have no proof that aliens have built this face in the surface on mars. This face you see on the planet is just a landform.

The face you might see in the photograph is just a mind illusion that you might see a face. the face you see is a hill that has been formed by the ways of the planet its self. It might have been molding from the dust and the wind dragging the red sand and dirt off of the hill its self.

We have no way or knowledge to know that aliens have built this face on the hill. The face has been forming for probably thousands and thousands of years. We think the forming on mars, like craters and hole in the ground, plus the face is just a natural landform forming on the crust of mars its self. How would we know if other forms of life built this face?...We dont know because we do not have that much knowledge about the space. There are infifnity of space out their that we have not explored yet so how would we know if the aliens have built this.

The thought of this statement that aliens have built this face in the crust of mars is ludicris. The face on mars has been formed by natural landformings in the crust of Mars. The theory of aliens made the face is as dumb as a bump on a log.        ",0
"I think the teacher should let any students play in any sports or activities in school because the might be better at sports or activities than any other kids. They should at least have a c grade to play in the sports. They should at least have a c grade because they are not to low nor to high. I think just because a student doesn't have a b grade and higher doesn't mean that they cant play in a spot or activities. Maybe they are not that smart but they are trying there best but they might not be able to succeed. Sometimes kids cant improve because they might have problems at home the teachers might not notice.

Maybe even smart kids grades go low and the teachers might not notice.

Maybe they have problems at home.

I think before they not allowing them play activities or ports the teachers talk to them why they have low grades. Maybe the teachers could help them with a problem and help them improve their grades. If the teachers connect and get the confident with the kids they might now what is going on with there grades instead of the teachers saying ""you can not participate in an activity of sport.""

The teachers could talk with kids and see if they could do anything to help them with their grades and help them improve.",0
"Although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but it's actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. Three reasons why I think being inactive is that I have time to rest, I can catch up on any t. v shows, or I can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest.

While being inactive there will be time where you can rest. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. Then one day when I was off, I spent my whole day resting. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. While I was resting in bed I had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. Resting this day helped me catch up on everything I needed

On weekends, when i'm at home and i'm lazy some times I call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. There is a show named Jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named Bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. This helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. In my opinion, I think he's doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. Jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make Bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because Bertrum will be exhausted all time.

When resting at home I have a chance to catch up on t. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. The reason why I want to catch up on t. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or i'll be caught in a family emergency.

Overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isn't always true. In the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have business calls on the phone. I think it would be better for us to work at home and be idle thank to go to work and be very tired. Though some people may not agree with me its better to live that way so you can preserve your energy. Determine never to be idle doesnt always make me accomplishing something; putting my mindset towards that goal helps me reach that goal even if i'm idle.",0
"Have you ever thought of being home schooled?

Nowadays many parents are very open-minded for their children to take classes from home.

Having to take classes from home can be much more time consuming than school.

Learning days start later in the morning, but not too late, so the student gets more rest.

However, you do not have to rush or procrastinate school work as much.

Working shorter hours may be helpful, but you need to be thinking about the cost of online classes.

Depending on the program prices can either be cheaper or expensive. Schools may have payment plans for monthly or yearly pay, discounts may be another reason why it is better.

Even sometimes when its something horrible going around, it can be offered for free. The cost is something you should keep in mind before choosing the right program.

Quite work environments can be very good for study hours and school work.

Having distractions can cause incomplete work, not handed in work, and lack of knowledge. While taking a test, you will never have to worry about any other students in the class. Other students could also be a major distraction in the school environment. Technology can sometimes be treated in bad conditions at public schools. Homes or libraries have way more advanced technology and hopefully good internet connection. Having your own technology is a great idea because it will not be touched by another student.

Last but not least, being home is one of the best reasons why being home schooled is a great choose. Eating home food instead of school food is something the students would most likely rather enjoy. Morning traffic can be the worst at times. Home school is saving your money for gas and the stress of the traffic.

All in all, being home schooled is an advantage from many things. Public schools have too many distractions and ways to make school much more difficult.  ",0
"Cars have been around for over hundred years. They caused some good and bad things. People use cars daily to go places. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.

To begin with there will be less car emissions. Ever since the first car rolled off the assembly line they have been polluting the air. As seen here ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter"" (Duffer). From all the cars and trucks that Paris has, they have the most emissions in their air. Another example will be ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France"" (Duffer). From experance working on cars the diesel engine give off the most pollution out of all the vehicles on the roads today. Since the air in France was getting to bad they had to ""Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at hme or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"" (Duffer). The smog got so bad in the air that France had to take a good amount of drivers off the roads to reduce their emissions so the smog will be reduced. As a result from parking those drivers ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined"" (Duffer). Today, cars are assories and people need their cars to go to work and cannot blame those people for doing what they had to do. One last example is ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Rosenthal). Since people are using cars less the pollution in the air will decrease. The emissions had gotten to bad and its hurting our Earth.

Lastly is there will be less traffic on the streets. Lately people have not been getting their drivers license.""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Rosenthal). The newer generation does not have the disire to drive and to work on cars like the generation before them. Another example is ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent were sold"" (Rosenthal). 70 percent is a high number of people and that is a lot of people that are not on the roads. Since those people are in Germany this is what happen in France ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Duffer). That is a huge decrease in traffic there will be no problems getting anywhere on time. Another key example is ""People park their cars in large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"" (Rosenthal). Since people do not have the money to pay for a parking spot they have to get rid of their cars and that will definatly clear up the roads. One last example is ""Vauban's streets are completey 'car-free'- except the main drag to down town"" (Rosenthal). Vauban's street are compleatly empty now hows that for no traffic.

In closing, cars have been around for a while now. They caused some problems and no problems. People use cars to go places daily. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.    ",0
"Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized the importance of experiences and taking responsibility for one's work. He believed experiences are essential for gaining knowledge and wisdom, and encouraged individuals to take ownership of their successes and failures. He argued that one should learn from their experiences and use them to become a better person. 

Emerson further believed that taking responsibility for one's job is essential. He argued that individuals should take ownership of their performance and strive to better themselves and their work. He believed that if individuals take ownership of their job and dedicate themselves to it, they will be able to achieve their goals and become successful. Furthermore, he believed being responsible towards one’s job allows individuals to create a sense of belonging and accomplishment. 

Emerson's views on experiences and being responsible towards one’s job are significant and timeless. Experiences can help individuals gain knowledge and wisdom and taking responsibility for one’s job allows them to become more confident, productive, and develop a sense of belonging within a profession. Emerson's emphasis on the importance of experiences and being responsible towards a job are important for individuals to achieve success.",1
"We live in an age of technology where one could not go a single minute without being influenced or even witnessing tech. Going off of that, technology is used more and more in the educational system, with classes using computers and i-pads for everyday acivities. The Facial Action Coding System would be a perfect addition to the educational sytem and could even make a huge impact on average people's everyday lives.

Technology in schools is a wonderful tool, offering millions if not billions of different sources and programs online with the click of a button. When used properly, students can grandly enhance their learning skills with the use of technology. However not every program, resource, or tool works for every single student, which is where the Facial Action Coding System would come in. Using this device, teachers can potentially get feedback on whether student's are enjoying what they are doing, what one could do to make a student's learning experience better, and with this device a teacher could even tell if their class is confused or bored. Since emotional expression are so important in a classroom, a teacher could potentially even modify the lesson plan based off of the overall moof of the class.

This invention is groundbreaking on it's own, and bringing it into the educational system with it's proper use and encorporation, could be of tremendous help to the United States educational system. ",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing debate on whether schools should extend their operating hours by two hours. While some proponents argue that this would improve students' academic performance and provide more opportunities for extracurricular activities, I believe that this model is not the best solution for our schools. In this essay, I will discuss the negative effects of extending school hours on father's attitudes, students' responsibilities after school, students' wellbeing and grades, and possible alternatives to the model.

Firstly, extending school hours could have a significant impact on fathers' attitudes towards their children. Many fathers work long hours and may not have the time to spend with their children during the day. If schools were to extend their operating hours, it would put additional pressure on fathers to spend more time with their children. This could lead to resentment and frustration, as fathers may feel that they are not able to provide for their families due to the extended school hours.

Secondly, students have many responsibilities outside of school, such as family obligations, part-time jobs, and extracurricular activities. Extending school hours would put additional pressure on students to balance these responsibilities with their academic work. This could lead to students feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which could negatively impact their wellbeing and grades.

Thirdly, studies have shown that students who attend schools with longer operating hours tend to have lower grades than those who attend schools with shorter operating hours. This is because students who have more time to study and complete homework are more likely to achieve higher grades. Additionally, students who have more time to participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to develop important life skills, such as leadership and teamwork.

Finally, there are many alternatives to extending school hours that could be considered. For example, schools could offer after-school programs that provide students with additional academic and extracurricular opportunities. These programs could be tailored to the needs and interests of students, and could be offered in a variety of subjects and activities. This would allow students to have more flexibility in their schedules and would not put the same amount of pressure on fathers to spend more time with their children.

In conclusion, while the idea of extending school hours by two hours may seem like a good solution, it is not the best solution for our schools. Extending school hours could have negative effects",1
"I was very excited about my first trip to the West Coast California that I took last summer. It was a place Ive always fantasized over because of its variety of beauty from the surfing beaches to the skiing mountains to the north. When I first landed in LA, I expected some hustle and bustle of the city like Miami, but it was overwhelming to see the smog and traffic that polluted many peoples views of California, along with the air. Unfortunately, this is the case in many car intensive cities across the globe where limiting car usage would go a great deal farther than people actually know. The advantages of limiting car usage would allow for cleaner cities with less air pollution, and provide safety for pedestrians and even other carusers.

According to source 1 on carfree cities, Elizabeth Rosenthal states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas of the United States"" Rosenthal, paragraph 5. This stat only presents part of the problem as the commercial and delivery industry add to that figure as well. Limiting car usage across the world is becoming more and more popular, as people finally come to realize the devastating effects of the greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere. Projects in places like France, Colombia, the United States, and other countries across the globe are making a huge effort at reducing car usage, and according to source 4 by Rosenthal, they seem to be working. "" Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by""paragraph 29. Obviously, car usage altogether will not end, but limiting it can do a great deal in protecting the only planet sustainable for human life.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars in areas of large pedestrian population, such as New York City, would ultimately lead to less tragic car accidents. Approximately 500 car accidents occur daily in the United States and probably upwards of 5000 across the globe. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in many societies which is unfortunate because almost all are preventable. Its when the driver is given too much power behind the wheel that their guard is let down. The rise of cellphones and texting have not helped the situation at all either. The good news is that the programs used worldwide solely for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are also reducing car accidents. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" Duffer, paragraph 14. Also in source 3 describing Bogota's Car free day is spreading to other countries of LatinAmerica with the intention of reducing traffic and allowing safer passage for pedestrians.

Ultimately, the importance of limiting carusage across the world is being seen as crucial and is starting to take off. Limiting car usage reduces air pollution which is a serious threat to humanity these days, and also diminishes car related accidents. At the end of my trip to California, I was able to see the real beauty of the nature outside the city, when I got off the highway.",0
"Working with a group or working by yourself.

There is nothing more beneficial than to have a team work, having to work with people that you like, and the people that know what to do; is one of the best thing that could ever happen to you. Now working by yourself gives you more benefits like, no one is going to steal your ideas or just copy what you do or write about which happens a lot when you are working with a team.

Working with a group is more like team work, is more like people doing less, what i mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each others and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of yourself, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping you

Working with a group is not too bad but it can be, me as a student i do like to work with my friends but they always copying me which i do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me. Is sad the way they always have to be in a team to be a better person in life, which is not fair because some times they are not even the person that did the work.

I prefer to work alone better than to work with a team, is not like i do not like to work with other people; that is just how i am. When i work with other people i feel like it doesn't benefits me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. It makes me feel like i can do more without having to need help from others.

In this world i have learned so much things, i have learned that you need to put you first, you need to think about you first, also that you need to have your own back. Working with a group in my opinion is something that should never happen, you might be asking why?. and my answer is that you should never feel useless, you should always think about yourself.",0
"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.",0
"Making decisions based on multiple opinions, especially those of older people, can have numerous benefits. Firstly, older people often have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can provide valuable insights into decision-making. They may have faced challenges and obstacles in the past that younger people have not yet encountered, and their experiences can be used to inform current decisions.

Secondly, older people often have a more balanced perspective on life and decision-making. They have seen the ups and downs of life, and are less likely to be swayed by impulsive or short-sighted decisions. This can be particularly useful in situations where a decision has long-term consequences, as older people are more likely to consider the potential outcomes of their choices.

Thirdly, older people often have a greater sense of responsibility and accountability when making decisions. They understand the impact of their decisions on others, and are more likely to consider the potential consequences of their actions. This can be particularly beneficial in situations where the decision affects a group or community, as older people are more likely to take a thoughtful and deliberate approach.

Finally, older people often have a greater appreciation for the value of tradition and community. They may have grown up in a time when values and customs were more important, and may be more likely to consider the impact of their decisions on the community as a whole. This can be particularly beneficial in situations where the decision has the potential to impact the community in a significant way, as older people are more likely to take a holistic and community-focused approach.

In conclusion, making decisions based on multiple opinions, especially those of older people, can have numerous benefits. Older people often have a wealth of experience and knowledge, a balanced perspective on life and decision-making, a sense of responsibility and accountability, and a greater appreciation for the value of tradition and community. These benefits can make a significant difference in the quality of decision-making, and can ultimately lead to better outcomes for individuals and communities alike.",1
If you clean up trash on the side of the road then that is helping the community. If you are walking to a building and you see trash the pick it up because we want to save our community. If i was walking down the sidewalk and very important building then i would pick up the trash on the side of the road. If i see someone throw there trash out the i will pick it up because i don't want to lose our community. I don't like it when people put there trash on the floor because if it is your trash then you pick it up. In the lunch room the other day there was trash on the table so i picked it up because the teacher said if you don't pick your trash up then the whole class will have silent lunch then you wont get to talk to your friends. I don't like to liter and i don't like it when people liter. I like it when people do not liter and when i don't liter. I think that kids should go around and pick up trash around the school and see how easy it is to pick up the trash in our community. It would not hurt them to pick up trash once in there life time.,0
"Agreement plays an essential role in connecting people's different experiences and allowing them to learn from one another. Ralph Waldo Emerson put it this way: ""In the state of communication, the power which resides in one mind, becomes the property of another."" In other words, it is through the effect of agreement that the thoughts and ideas of one person can be understood and adopted by another.

This can be especially true when sharing different opinions and ideas. By allowing ourselves to come to terms with each other and take into consideration the thoughts and ideas of others, we can become more informed, and better understand one another. When we seek to defend our own opinions or argue against someone else's, it can become a barrier to finding common ground and understanding one another.

In fact, it can be argued that without agreement, it would be impossible to develop any sort of understanding. Without it, it would be pointless to even try to share ideas, because there would be no agreement on what the truth actually is. On the other hand, agreement helps us to better comprehend each other's views and allows us to make more informed decisions. 

It is through agreement that we find understanding and insight into different perspectives and ideas; it allows us to grow and gain knowledge, which can lead to great things. Agreement plays a vital role in human interaction, as it allows us to come to terms with one another and move forward with our lives.",1
"I believe that offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home can have its benefits. It provides students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and can help them balance their schoolwork with other responsibilities they may have. For instance, if a student has a part-time job or is taking care of a family member, distance learning can allow them to continue their education without sacrificing their other obligations.

Furthermore, distance learning can also benefit students who struggle with traditional classroom settings due to anxiety, social difficulties, or other personal reasons. By attending classes from home, they can feel more comfortable and focused, which can improve their academic performance.

However, it is crucial to note that distance learning may not be suitable for everyone. Some students thrive in a traditional classroom setting, where they can interact with their peers and receive immediate feedback from their teachers. Additionally, distance learning requires a high level of self-discipline and motivation, which not all students possess.

In conclusion, while distance learning can be a valuable option for some students, it should not replace traditional classroom settings entirely. It is essential to provide students with a choice and determine which learning environment works best for them.",1
"The Electoral College has made everything easier on people. They keep votes fair, clear and concise and make them uncomplicated. Although there are some against the idea, the benifits outweigh the detriments immensly.

Bradford Plumer author of ""

The Indefensible Electoral College

"" insists that ""the electoral college is unfair to voters""(source 2 paragraph 13). This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway. It gives a simple vote to people and produces a clear winner. Also he states that ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""(p.12) He thinks that one representitive cant speak for his region, but thats why they vote right? He represents the majority supplimenting a clear representation of his state/region.

Also Collumist Richard Posner implies that the Electoral College has ""a presidential canidate [that has] trans-regional appeal"" (Source 3 paragraph 19). So the presidential cannidate can be based off a full region or more, not just a few states. This makes the vote obvious and is a more fair vote. Also the Office of Federal Register tells us there are 538 electors with a 270 majority int the Electoral College(Source 1 paragraph 3). Not only is there great variety present but with many votes they make the result concise.

Not only is the Electoral College making votes concise and fair, also it is currently working. Bradford Plumer states ""The electoral college is...outdated""(Source 2 paragraph 14). How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Fedral Register informs us ""You help choose you state's electors when you vote for your president""(Source 1 paragraph 6). This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in goverment.

Even though there are many counter-claims, the benifits surely outweigh the detriments. Its nearly a perfect system. The fair, multifarious choices, and clear voting of the Electoral college proves it deserves it's stay in the goverment.    ",0
"Student Selected Summer Assignments

Almost every student knows the dread of going back to school. The easy and laid back summer fads out and suddenly it's back to the old grind. The sleeping in till noon goes back to waking up at six, bathing suits get put back in the closet, and the sun tans fade. Yet, almost every student can relate to the one thing that always keeps them tied to school during the summer, the dreaded summer assignment. It could be a book report or a math packet, either way it burns in the back of their minds while they cannonball into pools. It seeps into thoughts while they try to fall asleep. If teachers gave students the opportunity to discover their own work, and maybe even a passion, students work would be of a higher quality and it might actually have them excited to go back to school.

When someone decidedly does not like something, you can't force them to like it, no matter how hard you try. That is what it can feel like for students when teachers assign work that is not interesting to them over and over again. There is no way for every part of classwork to interest students, but teachers could make an effort to make the one assignment that no one wants to do over the summer, interesting. When students have the ability to decide what they will study in a project, they are more excited and more willing to get the work done. Having students choose their project will save both the teachers and students from the painful force feeding of information.

Now, this assignment can not be a free for all, that would not be completely fair. There may be some students who go above and beyond while some may do the bare minimum and call it done. To avoid this scenario teachers could implement some sort of rubric or guidelines for what the student chosen project would have to include and how they will go about grading it. This way the playing field is level and everyone has the opportunity to succeed.

A common issue faced with summer work is the student procrastination. Obviously no one wants to do schoolwork on their vacation so it is common practice to put it off for as long as possible and then rush the night before. Even if there was three months to do it! With a student chosen project, students may feel more inclined to do their work because working on something that interests them won't feel like such a chore.

The end of summer is not fun for anyone involved, students and teachers alike. Why would we want to dampen the vacation with unexciting work looming over students heads the whole time. Students should feel excited to go back to school and be they should have something to look foward to sharing with their classes. It is common knowledge that doing work that is uninteresting to you lowers your performance and makes the work that much more of a chore. With student selected summer assignments we can prevent that and create a new wave of excitement about returning to school. ",0
"participating in extracurricular activities is like going on your dream vacation, it's fun and enjoyable. i agree with the principal, students should participate in extracurricular activities, for it helps students build social skills, allows students to build friendships, and teaches students how to solve problems.

To begin with, i believe that all students should participate in extracurricular activities such as student council because, when students are participating in extracurricular activities such as student council they are developing a number of skills such as, social skills. when students are communicating with one another and expressing their opinions or beliefs they are becoming more social. For example, when student are communicating and working together with their peers.

In addition to, when students are participating in extracurricular activities such as student council, students learn how to solve problems. for instance, when students are communicating with each other to solve a problem they are developing problem solving skills.

Also, extracurricular activities allows students to develop friendships. when students are talking and communicating with other students, and working together with other students they may develop friendships. for example, when students are working together in student council they are always communicating and sharing ideas, and doing this will bring them closer together and create friendships.

however, some people believe that students should not participate in extracurricular activities because, students won't have time to study for test, less time to spend with family, and students will be tired after they get home. but i do believe that students should participate in extracurricular activities.

in conclusion, i believe that students should participate in extracurricular activities, for participating in extracurricular activities has many benefits such as, helping students develop social skills, helps students build problem solving skills, and allows students to build friendships. ",0
"In modern day schools, students are focused on things such as technology more than classwork. Schools across America have adapted to this very quickly and now a lot of class work is done on computers and cellular devices. This advancement has been very beneficial to students and teachers, but because of technology students have begun to lose information faster than ever. Some teachers have even begun to assign projects over the summer time. Students have become very upset that they have to complete school assignments over the summer, therefore some have suggested to let students design these summer projects. It would'nt work out as many would think. Teachers should design summer projects because it will be more educational, better organized, and it will be retained better by students.

Teachers should create these summer projects because it would be more educational. Teachers jobs are to help students gain more knowledge and learn new things. Students just aren't capable of creating a project that helps them retain information over the summer. Even if students were to design the project it would hinder the accuracy of the information there for making it less helpful for them. Teachers could make it more accurate and efficient in helping them keep the information they learned before summer.

Also teachers should design these projects because it will be better organized. Some students aren't even capable of keeping their own room organized so why should school staff let them create an assignment for the summer. Though some teachers may not be the most organized they get the job done. Teachers have a tendency to keep things clean and neat due to them having to know where all of their papers and supplies are. Therefore, students should not design these papers because they are not organized.

Finally, the information they learn from these projects will be retained by students if teachers design them. Over the summer, students would much rather use their cell phones and go to social events than complete a project that helps them retain information over the summer. So, students would most likely design this project to be easy so they can finish it quickly and afterwards do anything they want over the summer. Though teachers could look over these projects and make sure they are educational, it would be much less of a hassle to just let teachers deign it instead of students. After students complete exams and essays at the end of a school they're most likely tired from the whole year full of work they just completed. Yes, it may be stressful but it is very important that students are able to keep this information.

In conclusion, teachers should design summer projects because it will be more educational, better organized, and it will be retained better by students. As shown, students are just not cut to design these assignments. Teachers should design them because it will be more beneficial for students. ",0
"I am a vegetarian and I believe that reducing meat consumption is beneficial for both our health and the environment. Therefore, I strongly advocate for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.

Firstly, reducing meat consumption can have significant positive impacts on our health. A plant-based diet is rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that are essential for maintaining good health. It also helps to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. In contrast, consuming too much meat has been linked to an increased risk of these diseases.

Secondly, reducing meat consumption is crucial for the environment. The production of meat requires a large amount of resources such as water, land, and energy. It also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change. By reducing meat consumption, we can help to conserve these resources and reduce our carbon footprint.

Moreover, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can also help to reduce animal cruelty. The meat industry often involves inhumane treatment of animals, such as overcrowding, confinement, and cruel slaughtering practices. By reducing meat consumption, we can help to reduce the demand for these practices and promote more humane treatment of animals.

In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is beneficial for our health, the environment, and animal welfare. While it may be challenging to make the switch at first, there are many delicious and nutritious plant-based alternatives available. By reducing meat consumption, we can make a positive impact on our own lives and the world around us.",1
"In everyday life, students go through a rollar coster of emotions with only few known of. They become happy on a sunny day or become upset after not doing so great on a test. Many emotions can be seen on the face but, students have learned to keep those emotions well hidden with the intention of not wanting anyone to know or find out. Technology being able to determine students' emotion would be extremely benefitial in helping the student fell better and being able to share their emotions.

Using devices to read our emotions would help frowning students smile more when they need it. The computer would be able to read their face by seeing the facial movements and determine whether a student is becoming bored in class. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, having a computer that can read emotions in class "" could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto 6). This could improve the student's learning skills and can help the teacher be notified when and where a student needs help.

This technology would not only be benefitial in the student's school life, but also in his or her personal life too. Computors would be able to see if a student was truely unhappy or upset and would be able to help in a way a human could not. The student may not want anyone to know of their sadness, but a computor knowing is harmless. Depending on the mood, "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto 6). With this technology, when someones is upset, something happy and encouraging could pop up and make them smile. This could brighten a student's mood and encourage them to keep working with a better attitude going out than going in.

The ability to know how someone is feeling without them having to say it could make it easier for people to jump in and help each other out. If one student sees another who was putting on a fake smile, they may be able to encourage them or say something nice to put a real smile on their face. Theory of Emotion, ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses the emotions, but may even produce them"" (D'Alto 9). Putting a smile on someone's face, even for a second, can truely make a difference. This technology would be extremly valuable a student's academic life, to help them to do their best and succeed, and in their personal life, to be more of a light to others.    ",0
"The advent of digitalization has brought about significant changes in various sectors, including education. With the emergence of digital technologies, information is now readily available at our fingertips, raising questions about the relevance of libraries in this digital age. While some argue that libraries are becoming irrelevant due to the easy accessibility of online resources, I strongly believe that libraries continue to play vital roles in our communities and should, therefore, remain essential.

Firstly, libraries serve as equalizers by providing access to resources for all individuals regardless of their socio-economic background. Not everyone can afford to purchase books or subscribe to academic journals, but libraries offer these resources freely. They provide a level playing field where everyone can access information needed for research or personal development without financial constraints. This promotes equality and fosters intellectual growth within a community.

Secondly, libraries offer more than just books; they provide a conducive environment for learning and studying. For students, libraries offer a quiet space away from distractions, enabling them to focus on their studies. Additionally, libraries host workshops, seminars, and other informative events aimed at enhancing knowledge acquisition and fostering community engagement. These opportunities are often unavailable elsewhere, making libraries invaluable hubs of knowledge.

Furthermore, although digital resources are abundant, they are not always reliable. Anyone can publish information online, whether true or false, making it challenging to discern credible sources from misleading ones. Libraries, on the other hand, contain vetted and trusted sources of information. Librarians are trained professionals who curate and organize resources ensuring the availability of accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information.

Lastly, the digital divide remains a significant concern, particularly in rural areas or developing countries where reliable internet access may be limited or nonexistent. In such cases, libraries provide essential access to offline resources and technology like computers and printers, which might otherwise be unaffordable or inaccessible.

In conclusion, while the digital age presents new ways of accessing information, it does not devalue the importance of libraries. Instead, it highlights the need for libraries to evolve and adapt to meet changing societal needs. By providing equal access to resources, offering conducive learning environments, ensuring information credibility, and bridging the digital divide, libraries remain indispensable in our communities. Therefore, we must continue supporting and investing in them to ensure their survival and continued relevance in the digital era.

"Working in a group versus working alone: an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks

As an eighth-grade student, I have had the opportunity to work in both individual and group settings. While I have my own preferences when it comes to working, I believe that there are benefits to both approaches. In this essay, I will investigate the advantages and disadvantages of working in a group versus working alone, and analyze my own personal preferences.

Working in a group can be highly beneficial, as it allows for the division of labor and the sharing of ideas. When working in a group, each member can focus on a specific task, allowing for more efficient use of time and resources. Additionally, working in a group can lead to the exchange of new ideas and perspectives, which can lead to more creative solutions to problems.

However, there are also disadvantages to working in a group. For example, group work can be difficult to manage, and it can be challenging to coordinate schedules and delegate tasks effectively. Additionally, group work can be prone to conflicts and disagreements, which can be time-consuming and disruptive.

When it comes to working alone, there are also advantages and disadvantages to consider. Working alone can be highly efficient, as there are no distractions or interruptions from others. Additionally, working alone can allow for a more focused and personalized approach to a task, as the individual can tailor their work to their own preferences and strengths.

However, working alone can also be isolating, and it can be difficult to get feedback and support from others. Additionally, working alone can be prone to burnout and fatigue, as there is no one to share the workload with.

In terms of my own personal preferences, I find that I work best when I have a balance of individual and group work. I enjoy the benefits of working in a group, such as the exchange of ideas and the division of labor, but I also appreciate the efficiency and focus that comes with working alone. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific task and the individual's strengths and preferences.

In conclusion, working in a group versus working alone has its own advantages and disadvantages. While working in a group can lead to more efficient use of time and resources, it can also be prone to conflicts and disagreements. Working alone can",1
"The author states that despite the challenges Venus presents in order to further explore it is worth of the danger that follows. The author states how Venus is ""Often refered to Earth's twin"" and becasue of this fact and how close venus is to Earth obvious curiosity sparked missions in order to try to land a spacecraft ""on this cloud-draped world"" named Venus. Although the author states how ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" and there have been numerous spacecrafts that have been sent on this mission it still should not stop us from trying again and finding solutions to these challenges. This ultimately leads the author to support the idea that ""studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

There are numours evdience in this article that support the main claim made in the article that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" First off the author states how Venus has a ""temperature average over 800 degrees farrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experiance on our own planet"" or earth. The author even gives an anaology to show, with imagery, what thoses numbers look like as he says, ""such envioronment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of the our ocenas and would liquefy many metels."" However this raises a question: If Venus is so ""inhospitable"" then why are there futher visits to its surface being discussed? This ties back into the origal claim the author supports as he says, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus becasue it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus was proably covered largely with ocenas and could have have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" The author is infering, because of these similarites between Eartjh, it is only crutial that an expolration of Venus happens soon, also becasue given the long time frame of the when the last spaceship tried to enter Venus's atmosphere which was three decades ago. The authorr is infering how despite how dangerous it is, like we have seen in the past attempts to fly to venus, it is more worth it to be more proactive and find options to make a ""misson both safe and scientifically producitve"" to futher study the unanwered question of Venus. Futhermore the author states how NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. This way "" a vehicle hovering over Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions."" This is one possible solution the auhtor claims that NASA has come up with to at least try to get close to Venus without damaging spacecrafts. With this approch the article even states they hope to send humans to Venus too. However this approch has its down side because; ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions."" ""Researchers cannot take smaples of rocks, gas or anything else, from a distance."" This however supports authors claim that ""studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" This is supported when he states that we should see this downside as a challenge to make it even better so we can ultimaly touch the suface of Venus even despite the dangers that come with this. The author supports this by stating that, ""many resaerchers are working on inovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaninfully to our knowlegde ofVvenus. Even despite the risk that eveyone knows by now scientists and reserchers find it worthy enough to keep studting Venus and how to get a human on its surface.

In conclusion, through out the article, the reader is given inshight to the dangers Venus presents on what reserchers are trying to do today which is to get a human on Venus. The author with evidence supports the idea that ""studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author makes it clear that these dangers do not have to be looked at in a negative way but rather can be looked at as challenges to try to overcome. He claims that these challenges venus presents have value becasue of how similar Venus us to earth. The author infers his will untimilty lead to human curiosity which will lead to endevors yet to come. Futhermore the author claims how setbacks should not make us quit and how our pursuit to Venus should not be limited by dangers we find along the way. Rather we should take that uncertinity and danger and us it to make venus a a worthy persuit to further reseach in the recent years to come.    ",0
"It is so amazing out her. I am sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. I have been on this sea for the nineth time. I thought all of my atemtes were fun but my last vouage was the best.

On my second atempted I serced as watchman. I think it is so awesome because I am going to be 18 years old when we reach Greece so I could help in the war! UNRRA hired "" Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Don and I even signed up so that is going to be even better.

We got the seamans papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece-with acargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed all the horses. I felt really besy all the nine voyages I took out there to Greece. My job was to check on the animals every hour.

I really do hope that you want to go too becuase it was the best thing I ever did and I think I should go again this year and next year. I was so glad that Don and me signed up for helping the other ""Seagoing Cowboys""

with all of the animals. I hope I can write another story next year.",0
"In world war 2 the UNRRA hired the ""seagoing cowboys"" to take care of animals such as cows,horses,mules and other animals.

Now if you ike animals and want to take care of them on certain occations then join the seagoing cowboys.""The cattle-boat trips were unbelieveable for a kid"" Luke said.

They travel alot and they see alot of places and travling can be sometimes intresting and fun.

It doesnt take that long to get to these places ethier, it only takes about a month because they are on a boat.

Now some people think thats long but it's really not.

They got to china from somewhere in the atlantic ocean in a month.

Not to long right.

The cowboys go to places for jobs and then the play games or go siteseeing its not all just work they have a ton of fun.

The cowboys liked to have fun too.

After unloading the animals they play baseball,volleyball,table tennis,and they read and box.

This can give you great oppertunities as an adult and a kid.

Some of it wont be fun you will have cetain jobs, but sometimes it's better to do hard work instead of play. From what ive said so far are you intrested?

Some of the jobs are even fun and majestic.

If your a watchmen you get a majstic site of what your around.

If theres danger your going to be the hero because you would warn your team about everything that is going on and tell them to turn around.

In some of these jobs you get to work with anaimals and that could be fun because you really dont do alot of work.

The most you have to do in that job is clean the animals and feed them thats it.

Now to me being a seagoing cowboy sounds like an awsome and fun job.     ",0
"Are cars even really necessary? Vehicles can cause a lot of damage to our ecosystem. Cars are not a must if wherever you need to go is right outside your door step. Rush hour will cease to exist if cars are not in use. Some advantages may come forth if vehicles were limited.

Cars produce pollution that endangers our ecosystem. Countries are taking action in order to save the greenhouses. Paris had enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. According to Robert Duffer, author of ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" he stated in paragraph 14 ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" Duffer also mentioned that Diesel fuel is responsible for this.

Why use a car if you're going down the street? In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 6, Rosenthal mentions that stores are placed a walking distance away rather than near a highway or somewhere you have to use a car to get to. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Other countries are introducing this motive as well. ""Vauban (Germany) is an example of a growing trend... to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning.""

"When people ask for advice why do they ask multiple people? When you ask more than one person for their advice, you get multiple points of view. Asking more than one person for advice is better because almost every person has had a different experience with something. If you only talk to one person and you just go off of what they tell you, your decision is going to be bias. The reasons why asking multiple people is better than just one are you get multiple points of view, every one has a different experiecs and opinion, and so your decision is not bias.

The first reason asking multiple for advice is good is you get multiple points of view. If you only have one point of view you do not know all the real facts. All you know is what that one person told you and your decision is not going to be accurate. If you had multiple points of view you would know a lot more facts and your decision would be a lot more accurate. That is the first reason why multiple people's opinions are better than one.

The second reason is asking multiple people for advice is better than one is every person has had a different experience. For example, say your looking to buy a new truck, you pick out one you like and you ask one person with the same truck if they like it, and they say that they hate it and it never runs right. Then you ask two other guys if they like it, and they say they love it and it runs perfect. You buy it and then you really love it, but if you had just listened to the first guy you never would have bought it. That is the second reason why you ask more than one person.

The final reason is if you talk to just one person your decision is going to be bias. When you have not heard from anyone else but that one person you believe them and think they are 100 percent right. They could be right, or they could be terribly wrong, but you don't know because you have no way to tell if they are right or not. If you hear from two or more people you won't be bias because you have multiple people's opinions. That is the final reason why multiple people are better than just one.

In the end you should always ask more than one person. Never ask one person, you are probably gonna end up with a bias opinion. If you have a bias opinion your most likely not going to make the best decision. If you ask one person he might be right, he might be wrong but asking multiple people will tell you if he is right or wrong. Those are all the reasons why asking multiple people for advice is better than only asking one.             ",0
"Getting rid of the electoral college would be illogical and irrational. The electoral college was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers to compromise between the Congress and the people. It is seen as non-democratic to the modern day system because the electors elect the president, not the people because when you vote for a presidential election you are actually voting for a slate of electors. Many people say that ""what if they go against your wishes"" but the truth is that it rarely happens. So there is no reason to wory. We must retain the Electoral College depite it being ""non-democratic"" because we will be certain of our outcome, avoid run-off elections, and Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have.

""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" in paragraph 18 meaning that winning the candidates share of electoral votes over powers his share of popular votes. ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama recieived 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney."" in paragraph 18 shows how almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. So even if there was a slight popularity it creates a land slide in that state.

Having an Electoral College avoids the problem of having an election where no candidiate recieves the majority of votes. For example in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both only had 43% plurality of popular votes. Which meant they were tied and meant of a run on election. However, having the Electoral College produces a clear winner. In paragraph 23 it says ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state - Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.""(paragrpgh 23) Meaning that they might not even vote if it's not going to count for anything.

Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have by population. For example in the 2012 election the popular vote was very close in Florida and Obama got the vote with 29 electoral votes. ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" because they mean more. (paragraph 21)

Many say that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnter take all system in each state. However, why would you soend time in a state that you know they have no chance of winning. It would be a waste of time and money. That is why they focus on the swing states.

The Electoral College method of selecting the president could cause potential voters not to vote anymore because they don't see why they would if it doesnt count for anything. However no voter's vote swings a national election. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think what a single vote may decide on an election.""(paragaph 23) This just shows how we should let the electoral college decide who will be running our country, not the people.                 ",0
"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that we have about someone or something when we first encounter it. They are formed quickly and often based on limited information, and can be difficult to change once they have been established. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why it is so difficult to change a first impression and provide examples to illustrate this.

One reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it is based on our past experiences and expectations. We often have preconceived notions about people and situations based on our past experiences, and these can influence our initial thoughts and feelings. For example, if we have had a negative experience with someone in the past, we may be more likely to have a negative first impression of them in the future. Similarly, if we have high expectations for a situation, we may be more likely to have a negative first impression if it doesn't meet those expectations.

Another reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it is often formed quickly and based on limited information. We may only have a few minutes or hours to form a first impression of someone, and we may not have had the opportunity to get to know them well. This can make it difficult to form a fair and accurate impression, as we may not have all the information we need to make a well-informed judgment. For example, if we meet someone in a professional setting, we may form a first impression based on their appearance and demeanor, but we may not have the opportunity to get to know them well and learn more about their character and personality.

A third reason why it is difficult to change a first impression is that it can be influenced by external factors. Our first impression of someone or something can be influenced by the environment in which we encounter it. For example, if we meet someone in a crowded and noisy environment, we may have a harder time forming a clear first impression of them. Similarly, if we encounter someone in a situation that is unfamiliar to us, we may have a harder time forming a first impression. For example, if we meet someone in a foreign country, we may have a harder time forming a first impression of them because we are in an unfamiliar environment.

In conclusion, it is difficult to change a first impression because it is based on our past experiences and expectations, formed quickly and based on limited information, and influenced by external factors. These",1
"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It is the second planet from the Sun. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about the dangers of exploring Venus. The author describes the temperature of Venus, the danger of its light, and the overall danger. Besides explains what Venus, a planet and not a star, looks like, the author also states that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""Twin"". Both planets are close in size and density. One difference is that Venus is over 200 times hotter in temperature than Earth is. The average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees in Fahrenheit. That is hotter than Earth will ever be. In In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such as environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author also states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury in closer to the sun."" In that example from the story, the author is trying to explain that Venus is so hot that it would melt anything in less then a minute.

Besides being so hot, Venus is also very bright. Venus's light is brighter than our eyes could ever see. It is so bright on Venus that not even researches can take a photo or a video of the planet. This must mean that research have to keep their distance. If they get close, they will have the risk of becoming blind or dying from the hot temperature. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" The author also states, ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" The auther is trying to explain that since researchers have to keep their distance, they can't take a sample with them to Earth. Samples from Venus would help them gain knowledge of Venus.

Venus has many dangers and risks of exploring the planet. Researches can't go to the planet because it is so hot and the light is very bright. Their machines keep melting from the hot temperature. The author in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains the dangers but the author also states, ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" ",0
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 So, I know I'm not the best writer in the world, but I'm gonna do my best to write a really cool essay about playing basketball and football in high school. 🏀🏈

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that requiring community service or extra punishment for students who violate school regulations is an effective way to promote positive behavior and a sense of responsibility among students. In this essay, I will research and compare the benefits of each approach and analyze their impact on students and the school community.

Community service is an approach that requires students to perform volunteer work in their community as a form of punishment for breaking school rules. This approach has several benefits for both the students and the school community. Firstly, community service provides students with an opportunity to give back to their community and develop a sense of empathy and compassion for others. This can help to reduce the likelihood of future rule-breaking behavior, as students become more aware of the impact their actions have on others.

Secondly, community service can help to improve students' social skills and sense of belonging. By working with other volunteers, students can learn to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and build relationships with people from different backgrounds. This can help to foster a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation or exclusion that may contribute to rule-breaking behavior.

On the other hand, extra punishment, such as detention or suspension, is another approach that can be used to deter students from breaking school rules. While this approach may be effective in the short term, it can have negative consequences for both the students and the school community. For example, students who are punished excessively may become resentful or feel unfairly targeted, which can lead to further rule-breaking behavior or even dropout.

Additionally, extra punishment can create a culture of punishment and retribution within the school community, which can undermine the positive relationships and trust that are necessary for a successful learning environment. This can lead to a cycle of negative behavior, where students feel more and more isolated and disengaged, and are less likely to succeed academically or socially.

In conclusion, I believe that community service is the more effective approach for promoting positive behavior and a sense of responsibility among students. This approach provides students with an opportunity to give back to their community, develop empathy and compassion, and improve their social skills. On the other hand, extra punishment can have negative consequences for both the students and the school community, and can create a culture of punishment and retribution.

"Working with a partner on school projects and assignments can be extremely beneficial for a variety of reasons. For starters, it alleviates the amount of work any one individual has to do and provides an opportunity for division of labor. From personal experience, working with a partner has helped me stay organized and on top of tasks in half the time. My partner and I split up tasks and multiple times our efficiency and productivity level was superior to if I had done all the work on my own. 

Another benefit of working with a partner is that it gives us the opportunity to learn from each other and come up with creative ideas in a process of collaboration. Not only do my partners and I learn new skills, but we also benefit from each other’s perspectives and life experiences.

Working with a team of at least three people on bigger projects and assignments also has its advantages. By having a larger number of people contributing to the project or assignment, it opens up the possibility to gather more resources, cover more ground, and think innovatively. In teams with at least 3 people, individuals can work together to truly diversify the skills, knowledge, methods of tackling issues, and overall resources in order to produce an effective and quality product or assignment. Considering the collaboration and mutual learning that come with teams of at least three, this is beneficial for students in various ways.",1
"""Ughhhh,"" said Generic_Name, ""I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!"" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. ""Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?"" Generic_Name questioned, ""well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school,"" Generic_Name's Mom replied. ""I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, dont you think so Mom?"" Generic_Name said, ""I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there,"" Generic_Name said, ""sure honey, I think thats the best idea ever!"" Generic_Name's Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.

First, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at least one school activity tend to be more self confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self-confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self-confident.

Second, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becoming a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.

Third, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high-school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.

Imagine, you have just made your high-school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. Your a great, wise person that everyone looks up to and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouth-watering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. These examples include, less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. There is less stress because you are always tense as stated in the first source. There's cleaner air because cars are one of the leading causes to air pollution as said in source two. There's also more safety because streets don't have as much traffic stated on source three and four.

One benefit of limiting car usage is that there is less stress. There is less stress because when you own a car you may find yourself tense a lot of the time or maybe all of the time. In source one, Hedrium Walter stated that she was always tense with a car and now she is much happier. Bike riding and walking outside can be relieving without the sound of motors, hearing the children play in the park and breathing the fresh air is much better. In source three Carlos Arturo Plaza said that car free day is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This is another instance of someone supporting limiting car usage because there is less stress.

Cleaner air is another benefit to limiting car usage. Cars are one of the leading factors to air pollution, this is shown in source two. In source two, it states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France afer fivedays of intensifying smog. This proves that limiting car usage provides cleaner air for the environment. With cleaner air, there is a healthier population which is a benefit to limiting the usage of vehicles.

There is more safety with limiting car usage. If car usage is limited, then there aren't as many car accidents and there is less traffic. Less traffic could also lead to public transportation becoming more efficient and faster. The bus would be able to get to places much faster without other cars being in the way with would be a benefit to limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage would be for the better of the population. It would cause less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. The usage of cars should be limited for the better of man and it should happen everywhere.",0
"Driverless cars. Are they really the future of transportation? I don't think so. Sure, they might seem like a good idea, but let's think about it.

First of all, driverless cars are gonna take away our freedom. We won't be able to just hop in our car and go wherever we want, whenever we want. We'll have to rely on a machine to take us where we want to go. And what if it breaks down? Or what if it gets hacked? We'll be stuck.

Plus, driverless cars are gonna be so expensive. Only rich people will be able to afford them. And what about all the jobs that will be lost? Truck drivers, taxi drivers, delivery drivers, they'll all be out of work. That's not fair.

And have you thought about the safety issues? There's already been accidents with driverless cars. What if there's a glitch and the car crashes? Who's gonna be responsible? The manufacturer? The owner? It's just too risky.

I know some people think driverless cars will reduce traffic and pollution, but I don't think it's worth the risk. We need to focus on making public transportation better, not relying on machines to take us around.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not the future of transportation. They're gonna take away our freedom, cost too much, and pose safety risks. We need to focus on better, safer ways to get around.",1
"I disagree that students should work at home because I think if students work at home It would be much more challenging and difficult. Most students would be confused and wouldn't understand any of the work working alone by themselves.

I think I would not prefer to work at home is because I would not be able to focus and understand the work. If you work in a classroom or school you can have more assistance. You can understand the topic or the work that you all are working on. Some students might also like working at school better because you get more help, and you can work in groups to understand the work a lot beter. In some other cases I think working in a classroom is more beneficial because it helps you pass your grade and get you to where you need to be ahead of your life.

Most students think it is easier to go to school at home. They think it is easier to go to school at home rather than at a real school because you have more sleep time. You can still enjoy the rest of your day without going to school. I think most parents would prefer their kids going to school, and being in a classroom so they can understand the lesson, know how to do it, and know what the teacher is talking about. Going to school at home can not help you pass the grade, go to the next grade, or graduate from high school, because at home you are not learning anything.

Working at a school would be more beneficial because you can have conferences with your childs teacher to see how they are doing in all of their classes. You can see if they are missing any work or haven't completed any ol their work. Most students like to skip class or leave school, so they never get good grades or so they will not have to do the work. Some students may get things wrong in some of heir classes but they still manage to try and do the work. Ohers may think the work is very difficult and challenging so they ask for help to understand the lesson so that they can get the work done.

In conclusion, I think working at school where you can get more help is way easier than working at home where you don't undrstand it at all and you have to struggle to figure out how to do all of your work.   ",0
"Many elections have passed throughout the years. When its time to vote people go out crazy just to cast in their vote. They are hoping that the candidate they selected gets nominated and win. The Electoral College is a method to elect presidents which in some way its a good thing. The way i see it its not, so i claim to change the way presidents are elected by changing to election by popular vote rather than the Electoral College because it is unfair. Also, its not really you who is being a part of which president you chose to win. Last of all, its a waste of time.

To start off the Electoral College should be replaced with election by popular vote because it is unfair for the most part. The Electoral College has its good part which states in source 3, paragraph 22 "" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep your despised method of choosing president"" "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" It shows how it helps with the majority votes. Yet it is more unfair as it states in source 2 paragraph 12 ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, he election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote the president."" This shows how if there is ever a tie then really your vote doesnt count since someone else has to end up deciding who to elect for president.

If we were to elect presidents by popular vote then it would be more fair since we are electing them with our votes.

Following how the Electoral College is unfair, it also shows how we really dont elect the president. In source 2 paragraph 10 it states ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This shows how our votes go to their electors rather than us electing the president. That is not a good way to count our votes because you never know if the elector is in favor or not with their candidate. Also, the electors could be anyone as it says in source 2 paragraph 10 "" They can be anyone not holding public office."" We never know if the electors are reliable and it can affect some people since they voted for that specific candidate to be president and they didnt get enough votes when in reality its between their electors and states. It just shows how in reality our votes dont really have a say and count in the way where we don't elect the president.

Not only is the Electoral College unfair and it really doesn't let us elect the president, it also is a waste of time. It's good how the Electoral College has steps and takes time to go through the motions of how many votes and who does the electors vote for and all, but it takes a whole lot time for nothing really. The election is really not with our votes, but between the state, House of Representative , and their electors. It just waste time as in source 2 paragraph 12 it says "" Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. where state delegations vote on the president. The Senate would choose the vice president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming. representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" This shows how it takes a long time within just them when we just waste our tim with voting since they would have the last word.

In conclusion, I claim on changing to election by popular vote than keeping the Electoral College because it is unfair. You arent really the one choosing the president, you are choosing their electors. At the end of the day its a waste of time for us to vote and to go through all those steps with the Electoral College and wait to see who gets elected. The Electoral College in a way shows how our vote doesnt really have a say and count directly towards the president. It is much better if the election would be by popular vote since it is us electing and we know who we voted and all. This way it let's us speak through our votes.",0
"I think we should totally switch to renewable energy! Fossil fuels are bad for the earth and renewable energy is good. First of all, fossil fuels are running out and we need to find new ways to make electricity. Solar and wind power are great options because they don't produce greenhouse gases which are making our planet hotter and hotter. My dad has solar panels on our house and it saves us so much money on our electricity bill. Plus, it's really cool to see the panels on the roof spinning around and making electricity.

Another reason we should switch is because fossil fuels are hurting our planet. When we burn them, it releases bad stuff into the air that makes it hard for us to breathe. My sister has asthma and she gets really sick when the air is bad. Renewable energy is way better for our health. Hydroelectric power is another great option because it uses water to make electricity, which is a natural resource that won't run out.

I know some people might think that renewable energy is too expensive, but it's worth it. Think about all the money we'll save in the long run! Plus, it's better for our planet. We should invest in renewable energy now so that we can have a better future.

I also want to say that renewable energy is creating new jobs. My uncle works in a solar panel factory and he loves it. He says it's really fulfilling to know that he's helping to make the world a better place.

In conclusion, we should definitely switch to renewable energy. It's good for our planet, our health, and our future. We should invest in renewable energy now and make the world a better place for us and future generations.",1
"A huge crowd gathered around me. Teens and young men were crowding around, adjusting themselves to get a better view. This was going to be difficult.

Someone shouted,""Why are you here?""

I closed my eyes and prepared my speech, here goes nothing. ""My name is Luke Bomberger and I'm am here, gentlemen, to persuade you to join in a program called the Seagoing Cowboys program.""

There was a hushed silence as I finished my proposal. I could see the looks of confusion on many peoples' faces. I'm off to a good start.

After a few seconds there was mumbling in there was mumbling in the crowd.

""What's that mean?"" Someone shouted.

""What do we do in it?"" Another chimed in.

There were multiple questions being fired in my direction and I was starting to get a headache.

""Lower your voices!"" I shouted as I raised my hands in a stop gesture,""I can't answer your questions when you guys are being so loud.""

Finally th crowd calmed down.

One young man pushed himself to the front of the stage where I was and asked, ""What do we do if we join the program?""

I was prepared for this question and replied,"" Well, in this program you have to help take care of the animals, like horses and young cows, to cross the oceans.""

I felt like that sentence didn't have enough information, so I added,""World War II has ended and we need to assist other countries that have been affected by the war.""

""WIll it be boring?"" One man asked from the back of the crowd. All eyes were on me, their gazes intent on what I was about to say.

I stopped and mulled over my thoughts before answering,""Well, not really. You would be able to see other countries and their landscapes, but you would have to clean the stables and feed the animals. When they are returned to their destination, on the return trips you can have a lot of fun. I had played some sports like baseball and table-tennis with the other boys who had join during one trip back to America.""

The crowd looked interested. I felt like I had said the important parts to persuade them.

""Is it dangerous?"" One person said.

""It can be at time when it's raining extremely hard on deck."" I admitted.

I thought I needed to say more, so I added,""All the adventures you can have will be exciting, but one thing this program has helped me be aware of is the people of other countries and their needs. I played my part in assisting others, will you do the same?""

There was excited murmmuring as everyone surged forward. I felt pride in what I had said.

""I want to join!"" Someone shouted.

""Where do I sign up?"" Another one asked.

I allowed a smile to appear on my face as I pointed to the left. ""You can sign up over there.""      ",0
"Why teachers should designed summer projects? it prepares students to be ready for the next school year. Students actually do what they suppose to be doing. Students don't have tow worried about what they need to be working on. Teachers should designed summer projects because it helps students to learn more on what they need to do and students know what they need to be doing without stressing about it; however if students designed projects it could be wrong.

First, teachers should designed summer projects because it help students on what they need to do. For example, it helps students to get to the level where they have to be for the next school year and students actually understand the subjects better. Students actually get the work done because they are doing. Teachers should designed summer projects because it helps students get ready and prepare. students should do what their teachers asks them to do so that they can get better and prepare.

Second, students know what they need to be doing without stressing about it. Helps students to understand what they have to work on. For example, there are many students that stress about it because they don't know what projects they need to be doing. Students take their time and do their work because they know how to do it. Many students don't get work done at home during summer because they stress about not knowing what they suppose to be doing, that's why teachers should designed projects.

However, if students designed the projects it could be wrong. Many students are lazy and they forget about the projects. For example, there are many students that don't want to do anything during summer they just want to have fun so they finish the projects the fastest they can without knowing what they need to be working on. Most of the students work during the summer and they don't have to actually do their work correctly.

In conclusion, teacher should designed summer projects because it helps students to learn more on what they need to to be doing and students know what they need to work on without stressing about it; however, if students designed the projects it could be wrong. Many of the students don't have to worry on what they need to be working on because they have everything they need. Most of the time students do what they suppose to be doing.

"Ugh, I soooo don't want to be writing this essay. But, like, I guess it's important and stuff. 

Okay, so, establishing a midnight curfew for teenagers. It's like, a thing that some people think is a good idea, you know? And I can see why. Like, if we're out too late, we're more likely to get into stuff that's, you know, not good for us. Like, accidents or stuff. And also, it's like, hard to focus in school the next day if we're up too late. 

But, like, I think there are more benefits to having a midnight curfew than just safety and stuff. It's also, like, a way to teach us responsibility. I mean, if we're not allowed to be out too late, we have to learn how to manage our time and stuff. And that's, like, important for when we're older and have to, you know, take care of ourselves.

And also, it's like, a way to, you know, help us mature. I mean, if we're not allowed to do whatever we want whenever we want, we have to learn how to, like, make good choices and stuff. And that's, like, important for when we're adults and have to make big decisions.

But, like, I know some people might be all, ""But, like, curfews are so unfair!"" And I get that. But, like, I think it's better to be safe than sorry. And if it means we have to, like, follow a curfew to be safe, then that's what we have to do. 

In conclusion, establishing a midnight curfew for teenagers is, like, a good idea. It's not, like, super fun, but it's important for our safety and maturity. So, like, yeah.  I guess I have to write more essays like this. Ugh.",1
"From the perspective of a student who regularly attends public school, it can be difficult waking up at 6:30am and spending a quarter of your day switching between classrooms. I for one have always thought about enrolling in distant learning, specifically online. In my point of view, the only downside to video conferencing and learning online is the neglect you may feel from your friends and in-school activities. Although distant learning holds the possibility of altering your social life, the benefits overpower the disadvantages. Students will be able to preform better in school with distant learning because they are able to create their own schedule, progress at their own pace, and decrease the chances of spreading or catching diseases.

Like mentioned in the paragraph above, it is my obligation to wake up at 6:30am and arrive around 8:00am. There are days that I feel like snoozing my alarm for an extra 30 minutes, and days where I contemplate whether I should arrive late or simply not go at all. This leads me to feeling tired when I'm sitting in class, not having the energy to focus, and consuming the strong urge to fall asleep. With online school, these problems would disintegrate. If a student's body refuses to let them retain information due to lack of sleep, what makes you think that they will progress in learning? You are far better off waking up at 11:00am feeling energized and alert. Not only are you allowed to wake up when you feel ready, but when you have completed all of your work, you have the rest of the day to yourself. During this time you can catch up with friends, family, or even take the day to yourself. Overall, if you are able to work at a fast pace and get your work done, the chances of you being productive increase.

Sometimes, if you are enrolled in any honors or AP classes, the teachers tend to move at a more rapid pace. Although some students are able to comprehend, others may struggle to keep up. Not being able to synchronize the pace your teacher is moving at can lead to you falling behind and feeling confused. It is not fun having to stay after school everyday and doing the rest of your homework late at night because your teacher is unable to slow down the lesson. This can cause stress for the student and countless, sleepless nights. Moving at your own pace will assist you in carefully understanding what you are being taught so you won't have to stress about it later. Not only does this make learning the material easier, but also preform better on the tests.

Diseases spread quickly. Not only does it spread through coughing, sneezing, and not washing your hands, but also through the air we breath. Schools are one of the biggest and most common places where diseases are exposed and passed on. Imagine how many people do not wash their hands after using the bathroom, forget to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze, and always have their hands on other people. With the spread of the popular epidemic, Coronavirus, our school district must take safety and health hazards seriously. A student who does online school or video conferencing has an advantage on not catching illnesses spread inside of school walls. Same thing applies if the online student feels ill because they are not able to spread their sickness to the rest of the school.

In conclusion, in order to decrease the amount of sleep deprived, stressed out, and unhealthy students, and furthermore increase the amount of productivity, good grades, and more sleep, it may be worth a try to consider enrolling us all in distant learning.                ",0
"Why Venus well it's simple ""our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".

The author believes that Venus should be explored because they may be somthig on venus that leads to new innovations or it may very well just be the part that making it to Venus is the innovation. The author makes sure to list the dangers so that there won't be a basis veiw-point and that talks about ways that could work. Even though in the ways there are also flaws which are also pointed out but the author tries to make a point that evenn though we are right next to Venus we know very little and that Venus could have been like Earth in the past. The author tells the reader about how there features that are simlier to thoses on earth like mountains, valleys, craters and may have even had large oceans and could have supported many types of life forms.

While there are many dangers like "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" even though past that there are coulds that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere of Venus. Then there is the surface which avgerage temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit mean that even though it is farther from the sun than Mercury it is still hotter. Another thing the ""atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater the what we experience on our own planet"" mean that man can't even reach the surface of Venus.

But if is lower then a D then they cant participate on the activities.

"The topic of driverless cars is something that has been talked about and thought of since the 1950's, but the pieces have never been fully put together. Driverless cars are not a good idea because of the ability for faulty accuse in an accident, vehicles are not truly driverless, and the privacy of the driver.

Accidents happen all the time and it is usually fairly easy to see who is at fault in the situation. That completely changes with Driverless cars. If they were to be manufactured and put on the road so many new laws would have to be made and old laws would have to be changed in order to cover liability in an accident. Technology does not always work out how its supposed to, no matter how hard the manufacturers want it to, so if something were to happen to the cars technology and an accident occured who would be at fault - the driver or it's manufacturer?

Driverless cars are not real. In order for a car to be completely driverless there should not be a driver in the front seat. With ""Driverless"" cars an alert driver has to take over when pulling in or pulling out of driveways or dealing with traffic issues. That is the complete opposite of what drivers want. Drivers do not want to deal with the traffic issues or the navigation through accidents, that is what most people hate about driving. So why would they want those to be their only priorities when driving? They don't.

So much of everyones lives today are always being watched ; most people want to get as much privacy as they can in their day-to-day lives. By using cameras in order to watch if the driver is paying attention or not is safe, but also an invasion of privacy. It is understandable why manufactuers would want to have the cameras, safety reasons, but really in all actuality the cameras and sensors would become something drivers become accustomed to and they will completely ignore it all together.

Driverless cars may be a thing of the future but it all comes down to the buyers. If drivers don't want to worry about whether or not their gonna be at fault in a accident, if they actually have to drive, or if they want their personal lives invaded ; they most likely won't buy the car.

"Dear Principal,

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job to prove that Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers that are presented, they do this by giving information based on actual conditions, studies and actual experiences. The author used a combination of all three of these to prove their claim that Venus is worth the danger.

The conditions in Venus are a great mix of specific material. The author thoroughly explains each part of the atmosphere in Venus. The text says that "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify metals."" They are proving that the conditions on Venus would exceed anything that our bodies could handle.

Despite saying this, they make a point when they begin into the discussion of the education it could bring us. In the text it is shown that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet it our solar system."" The author supports his argument very well when they say this. They used a status stand point which gives the author more credibility. He then forms a question within the text, by doing this it brought them the opportunity to show the research they had conducted for this writing piece.

The author brought in the research on the true experiments that were thought up through NASA. He builds up NASA's ideas by explaining to the deepest points, but never hits an oppostion until the next paragraph. When they do this it creates an amazing idea that could have the possibility to work imaged into the readers heads.

They eventually hit the oppostition and shows the down fall with NASA's great plan. They state in the text that "" More importatnly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persoanl despite the risks."" When the author decides to say this they prove the irony of it all. If you can't be up close and personal with the planet then you can't learn the reasons you truly cannot be. From the opposing standpoint it was supported very well once they did that.

They then go back on track to support their claim. They do this by explaining the experiments done in the past. They state a comparison to the readers when they say, "" Just imagine exposing a cell phone tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin,"" This comment that was made impacts the writing positvely. When they do this it gives the readers something to think about or imagine. It brings the issue to them and gives them a chance to relate somehow.

The conclusion that he provides gives a clear closing. He states his claim again and uses his evidence to bring the topic to a point. The closing gives you something to think about, it leaves you wondering about the topic and forming your own opinions. In the conclusion it states, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet te very edges of imagination and innovation."" The right thing is to not starve us from the education that could be provided just because of a dangerous boundary. All of the evidence that they have stated and proven through the whole essay just ends with them eventually just stating that it is the right thing to do.

The author does a good job of proving this through the whole essay.              ",0
"Dear Senator,

People have different opinions on the Electoral College. Some feel that it should be changed, and the president should be elected by popular vote. To explain what the Electoral College is, the Office of the Federal Register writes

What is the Electoral College?.

Bradford Plumer writes

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, to explain the problems with the Electoral College, and lastly, Richard A. Posner writes

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President to explain why we should keep the Electoral College. It has been made clear that we should not change the Electoral College.

It is true that the Electoral College may be confusing (Plumer), but it has worked for all these years, thus we should just leave it the way it is.

To start, The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress, and it also considers the popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the Federal Register). The founding fathers wanted us to use this system. They knew it would succeed.

Next, Plumer writes, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair..."" This is not true because the number of electorals each state gets is always decided by the number of members that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for the senators (Office of the Federal Register).

Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome. Plumer goes against that and writes, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This cannot happen.  Posner also writes that ""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" The north, for example, does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president (Posner). The president is everyone's president.

Also, The Electoral College considers swing states and big states. Plumer writes ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"". This is not true because of the idea of swing states and big states.  Swing States, also known as toss-up states, are the states that pretty much decide the election. They could go either way (Posner). ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senete decreed in the Constitution. "" This means that the larger the state (in population, not size), the more their overall vote weighs.

Lastly, by using the Electoral College, we are avoiding Run-Off Elections. A run off election is when no candidate recieves a majority (Posner).

In conclusion, you and I both know the Electoral College has some flaws, but overall, it makes sense to keep it the way it is.

Yours truly,

Emily.                                                                                                                         ",0
"Dear principal,

I have heard around the school and online about how you plan to make a new policy that does not allow students to participate in sports unless they have a grade B average. I along with many other students here at our proud school do not agree with this new policy. I have been asked by several students to write a letter to you stating that we do not want this new policy to become official and the reasons why.

One of the main reasons that have been told to me by the student body is that some of the best players on our teams are C average students. Without them our winning game levels will surely go down by a great amount. Even strait A students around the school want us to remain the leading champions in our district by having the other students remain on our team. School spirit is important to the students of our school in which we take pride .

One reason that effects me personally is that one of my closest friends has a C average. I have tried helping her in the past but because of personal issues at home she is not able to concentrate in class. The things she is going through make life itself hard on her. She has told me in the past that baseball is her only outlet to release all of her worries and anger. She is also one of the leading track stars at our school as well. To take her off of the team would for sure crush all of her hopes and dreams she has left.

She is not the only student at our school who is having personal family issues at home as you probably know. Many students around our school use sports to escape from their troubles. They enjoy it and it gives them something to look forward to at the end of the day.

Exercise is an important part of the deal too. Denying a child school sports is like denying them physical education. As an entire student body. A, B,C and below average students all need exercise and all go to physical education class. Some because it is required and some because they love getting exercise and makes school fun for them. To conclude my letter; what I am basically trying to say is that C average students should be able to play and compete with the rest of us because they are needed not only for the B and A average students but their en school too.",0
"Dear Principle,

I think that it is a bad idea to change the requirement to play sports to a B average because many kids that play sports have a average grade of C. Many kids in our school have a average grade C and I think that it is wrong to be able to take the privilege of playing sports away from them because a C average grade is passing in school. Many kids who play sports do not have enough time after school and practice to study for all there classes and finish there homework in one night and they try there hardest to keep up with kids who don't do sports but might only average a C in that class at that time. To pass a grade in most schools the average grade is a C, so to change our average grade requirement to a B would be unfair to students who only meet a average C grade in class's. Kids who play sports might miss class to go out of town for a game and might miss a test in class and have to make it up. But with the test there grade drops to and there average is below a B then they would not be able to participate in school sports so they would not be able to play in games to come and there would be no motivation to make up the test that they had missed to play the sport. Another reason that it would be a bad idea to change the average grade requirement to a B is because some kids try there hardest in school but only meat a C average but they also love to play a sport and you are not allowing them to play that sport because they are trying there hardest, so there would be no motivation to try there hardest in school anymore and there average grade would drop to less then a C average and would not be learning anything in there class's because they would no longer need to try to keep there grades up to play sports at school and that would ruin there chances of ever getting a good education because they would never try hard enough in school to maintain there grades because there would be no reward for trying there hardest. My last reason to not change the average grade requirement to a B is because kids who might be good at sports and not meat a B average might pay people to do there work for them or cheat on there tests in class, therefore they would not learn anything and when they go to a different school they continue there bad hobbits and not get anywhere in there life because they can not pass class's later on in life or get a good job in life. There is one more thing that I need to say about changing the average grade requirement to a B is because many kids can go on to be professional athletes but if they only get a average of a C and cannot get to there full potential they would never be able to fulfill there dream and never know what they could have been able to do. This is why I think it is not a good idea to change the average grade requirment to a B to play sports it should be left alone for the good of the student body.",0
"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, but I'm gonna give it my best shot! 😅

So, you know how sometimes you get stuck in a rut and do the same things over and over again? Like, you know, playing video games or watching the same TV shows? Yeah, it's super comfortable, but it's also really boring. And that's where exploring beyond your comfort zone comes in! 🌏

Ralph Waldo Emerson, this super smart dude, said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" 🤯 Like, he totally gets it! When you explore beyond your comfort zone, you're not just doing something new and exciting, you're also learning more about yourself. You're discovering what you're capable of, and what you're passionate about. And that's pretty cool! 😎

For example, I used to be super shy and didn't like speaking up in class. But then I joined the debate club, and now I'm like a total rockstar at speaking in front of people! 🎤 It was super uncomfortable at first, but now I love it! And I'm not alone – there are tons of other people who have explored beyond their comfort zones and discovered new things about themselves. 🌟

Like, did you know that Neil Armstrong was super scared of flying? But he still went to the moon! 🚀 And J.K. Rowling was a single mom living on welfare before she became a bestselling author! 📚 It just goes to show that you never know what you're capable of until you try. 💪

So, yeah, exploring beyond your comfort zone might be scary at first, but it's totally worth it! You never know what amazing things you might discover about yourself and the world around you. 🌈 And who knows, you might even become a superhero like Wonder Woman! 🦸‍♀️💪

Anyway, that's my essay! I hope you",1
"Failure is an important part of the pursuit of success. Indeed, some of the most successful people in the world have used failure as a means of learning, growing, and eventually achieving success. For example, Steve Jobs is famously quoted as saying “I’m convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.”. He made many wrong decisions during his career, but each time he used his failure to gain insight and learn from his mistakes. 

It is important to stay enthusiastic when facing failure in pursuit of success. We can use failure as an incentive to keep pushing for success, rather than giving up. We can also view failure as a challenge – take it as an opportunity to apply what we have learnt from it and take the necessary steps to break through the wall of adversity. Finally, we can focus on the resilience we attain through our failures. Taking risks and being bold enough to learn from our mistakes is how we grow and become smarter.",1
"As the debate over school schedules continues to be an ongoing issue, an innovative idea has been proposed: reduce the number of school days from five to four, and increase the length of each day to two extra hours. While this idea has drawn both support and criticism, there are many valid arguments in favor of the four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. 

First, a four-day school week would reduce stress by allowing students, teachers and staff more time to socialize, participate in extra-curricular activities, or pursue hobbies. The extra two hours per day would also allow teachers to dig deeper into their subjects and help students stay engaged and focused. Furthermore, a four-day school week would provide an economic benefit, as schools would need fewer personnel to clean and maintain the buildings. Plus, this would give families a bit of a break when it comes to childcare responsibilities, as they could use those days to plan activities, run errands, or simply get some much-needed rest. 

Ultimately, a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day would be beneficial for everyone involved. Students would have fewer days to feel anxious and overwhelmed, while still having the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying. Additionally, the cost savings for schools would be a welcome bonus. In short, moving to a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day represents an innovative way of ensuring students receive a quality education while reducing stress and providing a cost-effective solution for schools.",1
"Dear State Senator(s), there's something wrong with the Electoral College. It's unfair to voters. The voters aren't really voting for the presidents. So what's the point of voting? The Electoral College is irrational. I agree with Bradford Plumer, the writer of source two, that Bob Dole is right: Abolish the Electoral College!

As stated in source two, paragraph ten, ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Voters can't control who their electors vote and could sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. It's not fair, and it would be better if presidents were elected by popular vote. More people would vote if it was that way. According to the article,

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , even Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agree on abolishing the Electoral College. So, we have them, and over 60 percent of voters who agree. When can the U.S. just elect presidents by popular vote?

Now, we could keep the Electoral College because looking at the article by Richard A. Posner, it avoids run-off elections. The article,

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , says that ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.."" You could use that reason for arguing, but here's it's weakness: What if the disaster factor happens again? When in 1960, a state sended two slates of electors to Congress.

It's already been agreed that the electoral college is outdated. The U.S. should change it's method of electing President because, it's unfair, over half of the voters don't like the electoral college, and the disaster factor can't happen again. Why are we using a process for electing president that most of the voters don't like?    ",0
"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea for the studetns in the classroom. It may be good for many different other things, for example if someone needs help or in danger as in they could be crying showing that they are scared. But I feel they should take it a little more exstreme for things like could also have audio and could really help with peoples lives. Not even the bad emotions if you are happy or exicted it can sense that and something good could happen.

One reason I believe this would work because there is so much danger and anything can happen and we could use extra protection. But I also feel that it could be more to it then just looking for emotions. Even if they are good emotions there should be something to say or something should light up when the senseor feels that you are happy.

They should test it out and see how it goes and turns out for some people and if things go good the they should move it to the next step and add audio and see how much it makes a impact on peoples lifes.

Another reason I feel that it might work is because sensing peoples emotions is great. Peoples emotions shows alot it can say so much about their personality or how they feel about life, it could even gives you signs about that person and could get people aware so they can put thst person in a safe place if they need to. There should also be bounderies because most people arn't gonna want a computer screen or phone screen watching them, their emotions or even listening to them. But to even fix that you could always have were you could turn the senseor on an off just so people could feel more surcure.

Overall my thought about the Facial Action Coding System is great. You can take it so far and you can keep it how it is. Even if graphing shows that people don't like it I still think it is a good idea for me thinking saftey wise.

Thats just the people life and you can also take it very far with paintings. I think this idea is a million dollar hit and it should be tested out. ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I hear that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy due to complaints within the school. I believe that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free times as long as they are off during class because it will give students a greater sense of freedom and they aren't really causing any trouble outside of class time.

To begin with, I think we as students should be allowed to use cell phones during time out of class because it would give us a greater sense of freedom. Often times, we don't have lunch with our friends or even people that we know. And since we're not allowed to move lunch tables or classes during free time, we should be able to talk to our friends. I'm not going to lie and say we don't already use them during these times, but one of the reasons we use them is because they are banned. When students think they aren't given enough freedom, we often do exactly what we're not supposed to do. If we were allowed to have them during school, then we would be less likely to abuse the use of cell phones in school. Socialization is a key component to how we will grow and survive in life. If we don't have the ability to talk to people, then how can we be expected to continue growing and maturing? With the help of a new cell phone policy, our generation could grow socially and help make a very unconnected society connect on a more personal level.

Secondly, I believe students should be allowed to have phones during school as long as they're off during class because outside of the classroom, they really aren't doing any harm. If you think back, the reason cell phones were originally banned from school was because kids were using them to cheat on tests and class work. So why do they need to be banned during free time and lunch? I, personally, don't really think they do. It's not like we can cheat on what we're going to eat for lunch or what book we're reading. So let us use ours phones in the time that's given to us specifically every day so we have a break in our schedules. With the new policy, students still wouldn't be allowed to cheat, but we'd also be allowed to talk to our friends.

In conclusion, I believe students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch and free time as long as they're off during class. For one thing, it will give us a greater sense of freedom. Plus, they're not really doing any harm outside of class. so please consider changing the cell phone policy to policy one.

Sincerely,

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly believe that we all shouldn't have to do community service.

I believe this because it should be whoever wants to do it not you have to do it.

As much as it will keep kids out of trouble but will also take away kids after school activities.

I play baseball and basketball and i wouldn't want community service interfering with my sports.

Now the kids that don't have after school activities are the kids that should be doing the community service because it will keep them out of trouble.

An even better idea is to make it mandatory for the kids that do noting after school because those are the kids that end up getting in trouble a lot.

Our school does not have a lot of trouble makers but if you don't start making things mandatory for the kids that do nothing after school besides hangout at the bike shop they will all become trouble makers.

Also the kids that you know that are always getting in trouble on the weekends with the cops they should have the community service if anyone.

If a kid is getting in trouble a lot and then another kid is inisint and has done nothing at all he shouldn't be the one doing community service.

So we leave this decision up to you to decide but i strongly believe we all shouldn't have to do community service.

Love,

"Limiting car usages will cause a drop in the amount of pollution there is.  In source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, on mondays, motorist with an even numbered license plate will have to leave their car home or have a 22 euro fine. The odd numbered plates would be the next day and so on.  Using this way of driving, it reduced the number of congestion in the capital city of France by 60 percent.

Some places in Germany are catching on and making a comunity free of cars.  Residents of VAUBAN, Germany like the way this community is set up. ""When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter.  All they hear is the swish of bicycles and the talk of children drowns out the occasioal distant motor.  Many places around this world is adopting this act.

In BOGOTA, Colombia a program started for a car-free-day.  Only buses and taxis are allowed to be driven.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.  People who didn't participate suffered a 25 dollar fine.  Bogota made 118 miles of bike paths since the car-free-day.

By driving cars everywhere we are polluting mother earth.  We all need to get together and stop driving so much and this will help protect our Earth.    ",0
"Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a possitve aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timley fasion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be adventageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legeslators and cities are reducing automobile use.

Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. (source 2 paragraph 14) This is due to the fact that Bejing's automobile use is extremly high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their lisence plate number, or they would face a fine. (source 2 paragraph 10-19). This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not adventageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 (source 1 paragraph 5), ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.

Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where ""70% of Vauban's families do not own a car."" (source 1 paragraph 3) Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (source 1 paragraph 3) The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, ""For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million."" (source 3 paragraph 21) Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall well-being and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.

Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legeslators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act. (source 1 paragraph 9) David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" (source 4 paragraph 35) The support for a ""car reduced"" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.

Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. (source 4 paragraph 41) Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use.                                                    ",0
"Car-Free Places/ Bannings:

In German, they have a car-free cities.

""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district in the outskirts of Freiburg ,"" says

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . In all honestly, I think is kinda nicer because therefor, you don't have much space taken up with the driveways, street signs and you get more exercise if you go out and walk or run if you want to go there. But on the opposing side it could be bad if like the grocery store was on the other side of the town and you had to walk all there and walk all the way back with all your stuff that you bought and by that time you would be so tired. That's like me walking from the high school to the lake. If I started in the morning at lets just say 10am by the time I get there it would be like 2pm and if I go there and come right back I would be at high school at 7pm, not including the time I spent at the lake. What I'm trying to say that it takes so much time in the day and then just so exhausted by the time you get back.

In Source 2,

Paris bans driving due to smog, states, "" After days of near-record pollution, Paris enfoced a partial driving ban to clear to the air of the global city."" Which I think that means that they banned the cars or transportation to cut down all the pollution so they can breathe better and the air is cleaner and nicer. And i guess that worked because a couple paragraphs down it says, Congestion was down 60 percent after five-days of intensitying the 'smog'."" If that happened in only five days, I'm freaking proud, and think they did a good job and would be amazed of what would happen in a whole year!!

In Source 3,

Car-free day is Spinning Into a big hit in Bogota , it took place in Colombia and it seems like that they an annual day to banned cars; ""

It was the 3rd straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million.""

I think that its amazing of how these people pacticipte in something that is doing well for the Earth and for us as well. This world will be so much cleaner before you know it!    ",0
"Dear Mr. Senator,

I'm writing you this letter to discuss that we should keep the Electoral College. I think we should keep it because it's only a fair enough way of voting it is more consistant than others because if we voted by popular vote it wouldn't be much fair because as soon as most people found out there was a black president running they were against it the thought it was the worst idea ever. Instead of giving Mr. Obama the chance he deserved most people were against him. So if it wasn't for the Electoral College Mr. Barck Obama wouldn't have gotten the chance he deserved. Romeney also could've won but that's not the way Electoral College works when voting you are actually voting for a slate of electors and they chose the president.

The electoral collage some people might call it unfair or a disaster factor because it's not the people chosing the president it's the electors. The popular vote just chooses which person is more well liked not who people think will make the country a better place and so far no one is doing so. The Electoral college has a slate of trusted electors that has a certain party's nominee and the trust is rarely ever betrayed. Despite the Electoral College's lack of democratic process it's certainty of outcome is good as for example Obama's winning he received 61.7 percent of the elctoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular vote.

The Electoral College also should be kept because it prevents Run-Off Elections elections when no canidate receives majority of the votes. This why I think we should keep the Electoral College and not change over to the popular voting method.                                    ",0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Title: The Importance of Younger and Older Students Helping Each Other

As an 8th grader, I've noticed that there are a lot of benefits to having both younger and older students in the same class. While some people might think that younger students can't help older students, or vice versa, I believe that they can actually learn a lot from each other.

First of all, younger students can help older students with their academics. For example, if an older student is struggling with a particular subject, a younger student might be able to explain it in a way that makes more sense to them. Or, if an older student is working on a project, a younger student might be able to help them find resources or ideas to make it better. This can help older students feel more confident in their abilities and improve their grades.

On the other hand, older students can also help younger students in many ways. For instance, older students might be able to teach younger students new things, like how to use certain software or apps, or how to study for a test. They can also help younger students understand complex concepts by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help younger students feel more comfortable in class and improve their understanding of the material.

Another way that younger and older students can help each other is by working together on projects. For example, if an older student is working on a science fair project, a younger student might be able to help them design and conduct experiments, or help them gather data and analyze it. This can help older students learn how to work collaboratively and communicate their ideas effectively, which are important skills for any career.

Finally, I think it's important to mention that younger and older students can also learn from each other in terms of their unique perspectives and experiences. For example, younger students might have a fresh perspective on a particular topic, and older students might be able to share their own experiences and insights. This can help create a more dynamic and engaging learning environment, where students are able to learn from each other and grow together.

In conclusion, I believe that younger and older students can learn a lot from each other in terms of academics, understanding",1

"Well, first of all I agree with the new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systyem that enables computers to identify human emotions and I think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because some students might be having some troubles fixing their emotions, and i'm not sure if the essay is to write about the teachers using it to read the students emotions or it is the students theirselves that are using it to read their own expressions, eitherway i'm going to write about the two topics. About what I said about the students fixing their emotions is that some of the students might be so emotional that any little thing like when someone curses them they start crying, they might want to use this technology to see how their emotions are high or low, so they keep track of it and reduce the emotions till their brave enough to face anyone without having a lot of fear in them. And some of the students might have too much anger and they want to reduce it before it cause trouble for them and they might try it(Facial Action Coding System.)

Secondly, about the other topic is that teachers might want to see how their students are feeling, maybe sad or they have something in their mind that is giving them trouble in school or anywhere, because some teachers care for their students and they could ask what the problem is and the teacher might make the student happy by relieving them from the pain they had being through or stress, the student might even forget he/she had a problem because some teachers are good in making people smile like what the article says, ""Putting on a happy face"" actually works!""",0

"I think the community service is a wonderful idea. The children should know that littering is a bad idea. I'm sure that they would want a clean community and have something nice around them. Some littering can cause bad air quality. That just depends on the litter. Also it's better to have a nice environment. If i had things to do that was not been told, i' d be picking up litter and many things for the community would look nice when people are passing by. Also all students should be required to perform the community service. Also it doesn't take that much time is others are helping. The when everything is cleaned up, that's when you can do anything the children wants. Like for example: play in the dirt, run around, play with the equipments that's around there community, or listen to music and other many playful games. Well that's all i think about how you should require all students to participate in the community service.",0
"Pros and Cons of Attending a Normal School vs Distance Learning

Introduction

As technology continues to advance, distance learning has become increasingly popular. While it has its advantages, attending a regular school has its own benefits. In this essay, I will research and discuss the pros and cons of attending a regular school or distance learning.

Pros of Attending a Regular School

One of the main benefits of attending a regular school is the opportunity to interact with peers and teachers face-to-face. This allows for a more personalized learning experience, as teachers can provide immediate feedback and students can ask questions in real-time. Additionally, attending a regular school provides a sense of community, as students can participate in clubs and activities that they may not be able to do while learning remotely.

Cons of Attending a Regular School

However, attending a regular school also has its drawbacks. For example, it can be more expensive, as students may have to pay for transportation, uniforms, and other expenses. Additionally, attending a regular school can be more time-consuming, as students may have to wake up earlier and spend more time commuting.

Pros of Distance Learning

On the other hand, distance learning has its own advantages. For example, it can be more flexible, as students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, distance learning can be more affordable, as students do not have to pay for transportation, uniforms, or other expenses.

Cons of Distance Learning

However, distance learning also has its drawbacks. For example, it can be more difficult to interact with peers and teachers, as students may feel isolated and disconnected. Additionally, distance learning can be less structured, as students may struggle with self-discipline and motivation.

Real-Life Example

For example, let's say a student is interested in joining a school debate team. Attending a regular school would allow them to participate in the team and receive feedback from their coach and peers. However, if they were to learn remotely, they may not have the same opportunities to practice their skills and receive feedback.

Conclusion

In conclusion, both attending a regular school and distance learning have their own advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision of which option to choose will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences. However",1
"I belive that others should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. For a reason we all know to help other countries.

One reason that I belive that others should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because while your helping our country you can be enjoying sight seeing at the same time. You can see Panama Canal, Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy a city with streets of water, a excavated castle in Crete, and so much more. You can still have fun after the animals have been unloaded. You and your crew can play baseball and volleyballl games in empty holds where animals have been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, whittiling, games, and even reading can help pass time on your way back.

People might say that if you slip you can fall out if doing midnight rounds. Well, with the technologhy we have today you won't be as likely to slip and fall out of the boat. People might aslo say the that what if people attack you on the boat while sailing. You would be able to protect the animals and you because the U.S. wouldn't send you without any protection. You would most likely have guns or othe ships following you. Also, most likely no one will attack you while you are trying to get animals or help a country.

I belive that other people should join the Seagoing Cowboy programs because you can see historical sights, you can have fun after the animals get off, and a huge thing is that you are helping other countries.",0
"Venus is a rather intriguing planet that mankind would have a great interest in studying. Venus' great danger is what's stopping us from examining it up close. The author tries to say that overcoming this danger is worth dealing with to explore Venus, however. I believe their claim is valid and that there is value of trying to study the planet, even with these dangerous conditions. There's even a decent chance of working around the risks. The author uses reasons like it's the most Earth-like planet, studying Venus from a ship orbiting around the planet isn't insightful enough to learn much, and that NASA is even coming up with different methods of studying the planet to justify their idea.

There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Venus was originally similar to Earth in quite a few ways. The planet was likely covered with oceans that could've been able to support life. Venus also had other features like rocky sediment, craters, valleys, and mountains. Venus is also sometimes the closest planet to Earth, often swapping back and forth with Mars being the closest. This evidence shows that it's likely Venus was essentially an alternate version of Earth.

It's also a good point that hovering above the planet and observing it just isn't effective enough at gathering information. Since the atmosphere is impenetrable to light, photography and videography of the surface is near pointless. The inability to go down to the ground and collect samples of the materials, substances, and gases hinders our ability to understand the planet. Researchers are even considering innovating space technology to allow us to gather some form of meaningful knowledge. We need to advance past observing from an orbital space station and find a way to get down there.

NASA realizes that problems could be solved with the right approach. They've tested how long some electronics made of silicon carbide could survive in Venus' conditions and so far, the results have shown that there is potential. Building resistant computers may also collect information on the planet, but mechanical computers may get this job done the best. Mechanical computers were used in World War II, but they were sturdier than modern computers and don't require any electronics to function. If one method of getting closer to the planet doesn't work, we could always try again with another.

Overcoming the dangers of Venus is currently one of the toughest challenges of space exploration we've seen yet. With enough determination and patience though, we can find a way to work around this dilemma; especially since NASA clearly hasn't given up working on solutions. This may be necessary too; our current method of studying this place just isn't that good. The reward may be worth the effort too since Venus is one of the most interesting planets we've attempted exploring. Let's just hope that this won't stop us from wanting discover the whole universe.",0
"The student council is holding a meeting at the cafeteria while the school basketball team is practicing for their upcoming game. These things are called extracurricular activities. The principle has decided these things are mandatory. I think students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students schedules and students being forced to do something they dont want to do.

Lots of students have busy lives. Students and their parents could have something planned or reserved for a certain time.( going to parties, a get together, vacations/trips, shopping etc.) The activity and plan might collide, which probably would cause rescheduling and chaos. Students could also already have an activity outside of school. How I see it in my mind is that if someone already takes a sport (outside of school) and now has to take another activity in school. They would have less time, less motivation, and more work. Our four core classes and two electives already give us plenty of homework to do. Doing an activity will require more effort and less time to do the homework from our classes. Whether it be a writing assignment for the student council, doing work for the yearbook club or practicing for a sport.

Students may feel forced to do an activity they dont like. For some kids their might not be an activity they enjoy and then proceed to pick one they dont like. Doing this could make them resent school or feel some type of sadness. Their also could be a large demand for one activity a student has applied for. After applying the student learns hes been excluded because of maximum limit of people in one club. The student is now in a club he doesn't enjoy. If I was in the student shoes i would feel like the school has been unfair or betrayed me. Being forced to do something is almost never a good thing. especially if you don't enjoy it. Forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do could cause a state of depression, anxiety or a fear of it.

However, participating in extracurricular activities would mean less screen time. Students can socialize and plus most teenagers are addicted to their phones and its not healthy for them at all. Doing activities will decrease the time by a good percentage. Being addicted to anything is definitely not healthy but, being forced to do something isnt either. In my opinion more screen time is better than doing something you resent because you are enjoying it and you are also technically socializing by messaging or calls. All in all lots of screen time may not be healthy, but its better than participating in activity you dont like.

In conclusion it shouldn't be mandatory to be in an extracurricular activity because of the schedules of students and being forced to do something you dont want to do. Activities will interfere with these things causing chaos and even resenting school. This is my honest opinion on this decision. If you take the time to think about this decision, you'll realize whos going to be effected and how they are going to be effected. This is why I disagree about having to participate in extracurricular activities.",0
"Dear principal

I don't think that it would be right to make are good players have to get kicked of their teams because they have Cs or C+. i think that if they have a C- or lower they shouldn't be able to play but not B or higher its just not fair. also some kids i have a hard time in school but are good at sports and maybe are school needs some good players so we can win a few games.

I'm just thinking that are players on any of our after school programs. Need to get cut a little slack or maybe we need less homework maybe that's the real problem here. That us students get over loaded with a lot of homework at school. And school and sports are hard to maintain after all we do try to get it all done but there's to much to handle with 8 classes and all.

sports to some people mean nothing but to others they mean a lot some kids do sports to impress someone. Others because they are good also. Some are living up to someone in the family like a dad or grandpa, uncle for some of them that have Cs are gunna be really upset that they will be kicked off the team because they don't have a B average.

So i don't think that you should do this to those kids that want to be on the team say they are good at the sport and they have won us lots of games we need students like that to make our school known in the other schools. So please don't make this a new rule lots of us will be sad that we wont have a team anymore...",0
"To the whom it may concern:

The rule for cell phones is always discussed. For the two years I have been at this school I have seen plenty of my peers' cell phones taken away. During class I think enforcing the rule of no cell phones is legitimate. If people have phones out how are they supposed to pay attention during class. With that rule i totally agree with you. But, I might say that I think we should be able to have our phones out before school, passing periods, and lunch. We aren't bugging anyone in class, so i really don't see a problem.

I strongly believe that we should be able to have our phones out outside of class. One reason i believe this is because many times my friends have had to hide in the bathrooms or hide behind friends because they have to text or call their parents. A lot of the time it is because we don't feel good or sometimes we might have forgotten a project that our teachers will not accept late. Half of the time we aren't using our phones to talk to our friends. We need them for important reasons. Or sometimes our parents need to get a hold of us. Yes, it's true that our parents could contact the office and the office would send us a pass letting us know the news. But, sometimes the news is personally and we don't want other people knowing what's going on. Anyways this isn't always effective because my friends mother had called saying she needed to go home with her friend because she could not pick her up that day. Well, my friend never got the note from the office and her mom had to get off her job to pick her up. This could have easily been avoided if she could have used her cell phone.

Another reason that may not be appealing to you as it is to us, but we need our cell phones for memories. For my friends and I this will be our last year of 8th grade. We would like to get as many pictures of us together as possible. On spirit days, Spring Fair, Food Fairs, and rallies those are some of the most fun days for us. We like to use our cell phones for pictures so we can always remember those days. Of course we can always think about those days, but a picture is worth a thousand words. Can you imagine if your most favorite photo that you have was never allowed to be taken? You would remember that memory, but doesn't that picture always make you smile. That's how it is for us. This time in school for us means a lot. Our last year in middle school. We try to make this one of the best years. With field trips like to Disney Land or Sunsplash those are two things we are going to look back on forever.

Of course you could argue that if you let kid shave their phones out during passing periods and lunch, they might use them during class. That is an understandable argument, but i think if you let kids have their phones while they are not in class that be a reward to them. You could also say that any students caught with their phone inside the class room will get and automatic detention and their phone will be taken away. I think that would solve the problem.

It may seem like we're asking a lot, but we really aren't. If we had this chance we could prove to you that it would not be a problem.

" In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards accelerating the high school graduation process. Some schools are offering programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. While this idea has been met with mixed opinions, I believe that it is a positive change that can benefit students in many ways.

One of the main advantages of this program is that it allows students to save time. With the fast-paced nature of modern life, it is becoming increasingly important for individuals to be able to move quickly and efficiently through the education system. By graduating in three years, students can enter college or the workforce one year earlier, giving them a head start on their careers.

In addition, this program can provide students with new experiences and challenges that will help shape their future. High school students who choose to graduate in three years will be required to take courses in a shorter amount of time, which will put them under pressure to succeed. However, this pressure can be a positive thing, as it will help students develop resilience and self-discipline, which are valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.

Another benefit of this program is that it allows students to take elective courses that may not be available to them if they were following the traditional four-year plan. While some students may not be interested in these courses, others may find them valuable in helping them pursue their career goals. By graduating in three years, students can choose to take elective courses later on, if they wish.

Of course, there are those who argue that this program is too stressful for students and that they may not be able to gain enough knowledge if they are rushing through their education. However, it is important to remember that the goal of education is not just to acquire knowledge, but also to prepare students for the real world. By graduating in three years, students can gain valuable experience and skills that will help them succeed in their careers.

In conclusion, I believe that the program that allows high school students to graduate in three years is a positive change that can benefit students in many ways. It allows students to save time, gain new experiences and challenges, and take elective courses that may not be available to them otherwise. While there may be some stress involved, the benefits of this program far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Ultimately, it is up to each individual student",1
"Dear principal what are community service: is when people come together to help make the community better. helping the community is very important. i think our school students should be required to perform community service, instead of waiting for the school cleaners to take away the trash and clean up the class room at the end of the day. i think students should do it them selves. you can help taking part of community service for example: cleaning up litter, sweeping the lunch room after use, picking up used trash. community service is not meant for school alone there are different palaces community service could take place for example : you house, your neighbourhood, anywhere around you that is need to be clean. i know students have something better to do like, their homework, play video games, i think there is time for everything. and students should always take part in anything that would make their community better and cleaner.",0
" I agree that pursuing our own goals and aspirations is the greatest accomplishment, but sometimes it can be challenging to achieve what we want. For example, I have always wanted to become a successful entrepreneur, but my family has always been hesitant about the idea, and I have struggled to find the resources and support I need to make it happen.

However, I believe that it is important to pursue our goals, even when it is difficult. It may require us to step out of our comfort zones and take risks, but the rewards can be worth it. In order to achieve my goal of becoming an entrepreneur, I have had to do a lot of research and seek out advice from experts in the field. I have also had to be persistent and determined, even when faced with setbacks and obstacles.

It is also important to have a support system in place when pursuing our goals. Whether it is a mentor, a friend, or a family member, having someone who believes in us and encourages us to keep going can make all the difference. I have been fortunate enough to have a few people in my life who have been supportive of my dreams, and their encouragement has helped me to stay motivated and focused.

Ultimately, I believe that everything is possible if we put in the effort and have the right support system in place. Whether it is starting a business, pursuing a career, or simply making a positive change in our lives, we should never give up on our goals, no matter how difficult they may seem. By working hard and staying determined, we can achieve anything we set our minds to.",1
"Working alone or in a group, which one is better? This is a question that has been debated for years. Both have their own set of advantages and disadvantages, and it ultimately depends on the individual and the task at hand. In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of working alone versus working in a group, the common challenges faced when working alone, potential strategies for overcoming these challenges, and how music can help someone stay focused when working alone.

Working alone has its own set of advantages. For one, it allows for greater flexibility in terms of scheduling and work style. People who prefer to work alone can create their own work environment and work at their own pace without the distractions of others. Additionally, working alone allows for a greater level of focus and concentration, as there are no other people to consider or coordinate with.

However, working alone also has its own set of challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of social interaction and support. When working alone, it can be difficult to get feedback and advice from others, and it can be isolating. Additionally, it can be difficult to stay motivated and on track without the support of a team.

To overcome these challenges when working alone, there are a few strategies that can be helpful. First, it's important to establish a routine and set goals for yourself. This can help keep you on track and motivated. Additionally, it can be helpful to schedule regular check-ins with colleagues or friends to get feedback and advice. Finally, it's important to take breaks and engage in self-care activities to avoid burnout.

When compared to working alone, working in a group has its own set of advantages. For one, it provides a sense of community and social interaction. Working in a group can also provide a greater level of support and feedback, as there are others to turn to for help and advice. Additionally, working in a group can provide a greater level of collaboration and problem-solving, as there are multiple perspectives to consider.

However, working in a group also has its own set of challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the potential for conflict and disagreement. When working in a group, it's important to communicate effectively and respect the opinions and ideas of others. Additionally, it can be difficult to coordinate schedules and work styles when working in a group.

To overcome these",1

I could've go to a other place but as I am teeneger, can not go to for long distance so I choose here. One of the reason you should hire me, is I was in varcity swim team at school before so I know how to team work with co-workers, and I could use team work for team for customer servise also, like if I brought wrong order for a customer, I apologize first and bring right order with some extra cutomer servise. Second, I al ways help my mom and do chores for her. Clean living room, kitchen, basement, bathroom, and other rooms. That helps me when customer is complaining about like a table is dirty, or floor is mess, I can go there quickly and clean them fast as I could and go back to my job. Also, my hobby is to playing games. But I limited the time when to stop so I do not over-play and control myself to keep playing and stay up till midnight. Also, I have lifeguard certificate, so I know how to first aid a customers.

"When you lower the usage of cars in a certain area, you could see many benefits. Remember when you would hear occassionally that pollution in certain areas are affecting the world. And is it sort of worrying that you might be in one of those cities? Well, one of the main contributors is cars. Driving around, dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Swiping its claws at the Ozone layer. Many countries have suffered this pollution the hard way. As in France, they had to ban certain cars after every few days or so. Because the Smog in there was so dense. The pollution could have been very harmful if not given the right precautions. Scary right? Thats why citys like Vauban, Germany have noticed these facts and are now trying out some very ""Eco friendly"" solutions to help. They simply didnt use cars. They resident of the area knew of the danger and gave up their cars for the greater good. And it worked. The city was and still is very clean. And peacful without the very few sounds of motor cars from a distance away. A few city caught on to this, as they are also worried about pollution engulfing their atmosphere. So a few other city like Bogota, Columbia. Have made a car-free day in which the only means of transportation was a: Bus, foot, or bike. Which lowered the number of people you would see on the street. It was a big success in Bogota. But few other countries have caught on to this. Like Beijing, China. The most polluted city on earth, is like a giant vortex of smog and trash. They didn't notice yet. And might be one of the few city that find out the hard way when you keep putting smoke in Mother natures face. But our country, America. Is finding out the safe way to travel with less pollutant use. We are trying new and better means of transportation. As in Biking, Carpooling. Or just walking if the distance isn't that tough. Fewer teens these days could honostly couldnt care less about a drivers license. Now they just carpool with other friends or take public transportation. The percentage of peak drivers have descresed to a percentage that of which was around 1995. These pieces of evidence tell us that we can make this world a better place, for the good. Its just a simple step to a bigger door. To where we actually don't have to worry about global warming, or pollution in certain countries. We should just live peaceful lives. And not about whats gonna happen first. Vauban, Bogota, Paris, Asuncion Paraguay. And small parts of the United States have thought about this. When will the rest of us get the picture? Limiting car usage is very vital to pollution and will kick it down a notch. And we could wake up in the morning to see a beautiful glimering sky. Shining its blue flourescent light back at you. Not a giant billowing ball of black smoke that will cover your sky. Turning it into a Gloomy, dull patch of depression on your day. That is why you have to lower your car usage every now and then. Or else, it could end up like that. It might end up as in you make the decision. Or your peers make the decision. You really should consider the darger of what might await you when you step into your car.    ",0
"Dear Principal,

I know the idea of letting students have their cell phones out in school is an irritating process. When a students cell phone rings in class, it can interrupt the class and it can distract the student and everyone around them. I believe that as long as students get to class in time after lunch, they should be able to use their phones.

The truth is that lunch can sometimes get boring. Most of the times, the student might not have any friends to talk to while they're downstairs. If most schools use what we use here at SCHOOL_NAME, which is detention, mostly known as ""the bench"" most students would have friends that don't do their homework or might of done something to get them on the bench. Don't you think it would be unfair for a student to be all alone in lunch not having anything to do? Lunch is supposed to be a free time where we can have fun, instead of being bored in class like it shows in the video, but right now it feels like its just another class period. Students don't get to use their phones, and they're being supervised.

As long as phones are being turned off by the time they're in class, students should be able to use them. Although a student might have a class after lunch, snack or any other free period, using a phone can let them concentrate more. It lets them concentrate more in the perspective that a student might want to use their phone badly during class. Instead of taking the phone out and using it in a sneaky way, like it shows in the video, they can just take it out in their free time and pay more attention during class. Not giving a student the ability to use their phones, might increase the chance of a students grade getting lower, or them getting their phones taken away. I'm sure any principal would prefer to get their students grade to be high and to be enthusiastic about going to school. Also as you can see in the video, some students would just stay outside of school, which makes them be late, just to talk on the phone. When staying out is not an option, they might also just stay in their locker and miss some time in the class just to be on the phone.

Giving something new a try, can help you see if it would succeed or if it just simply has to be taken away. Trying using the phones during lunch and other free periods at least for a month, can make you see if its worth it or if its just not possible. If it shows a lot of distraction in getting back to class or on point then you can take it away permanently or for a few days.

Sincerely, your student.      ",0

"Working in a group or working alone has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. While some people may prefer to work alone, others may find it more beneficial to work in a group. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of working together in a group versus working alone, and provide examples to support my argument.

Working in a group can be very beneficial as it allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives. When people work together, they can bounce ideas off each other and come up with creative solutions to problems. This can lead to more innovative and effective solutions than if someone were to work alone. For example, in a group project at school, my classmates and I worked together to create a presentation on climate change. We each brought our own unique ideas and perspectives to the project, and through our discussions and collaborations, we were able to create a well-rounded and informative presentation.

Another benefit of working in a group is the opportunity to learn from others. When people work together, they can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. This can help to improve their own skills and knowledge, and can also lead to better communication and understanding between team members. For example, in a group project at school, my classmates and I worked together to create a business plan for a fictional company. We each had different areas of expertise, and through our collaborations, we were able to learn from each other and improve our own skills.

Working alone can also have its benefits, such as increased focus and productivity. When people work alone, they can often be more focused on their task and less distracted by the thoughts and ideas of others. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. For example, when I am studying for an exam, I often prefer to work alone in a quiet environment. This allows me to focus on my studies and avoid distractions.

In conclusion, working together in a group and working alone both have their own set of benefits. Working in a group allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives, as well as the opportunity to learn from others. Working alone can lead to increased focus and productivity. Ultimately, the best approach depends on the task at hand and the individual's preferences.",1
"Dear My Principal!,

I agree with you that students should have at least a B in all core classes if they want to participate in any sports.

Students should not be involved in this case because if we let them do it now then the students will think its all right to fail their classes.

If we discipline them then it will encourage students to do well in their classes.

If we don't make this policy than the parents of the children might think we don't care about their education.

Many parents may take their kids out of our school because were not giving a good education.

With all the C average students and failing students the school might be one of the worse schools in the state maybe even the country.

Being one of the worse schools is bad because you will not get any more students the following year.

It is also bad because our school could be the only school a child can come to and they cant get their education.

I think in every school that should be the case so none of these things can happen.

No matter how bad the kids pout or what they say they should not be able to play any sports or do any activities without at least a B.

You should tell your students that even though your mad right now about this, one day they will thank me for it.

"The author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becuase the author thinks that they are ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"".

In the text it states that ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for mote then a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity us."" and what i think the author means that venus would be a very challenging planet for humans to study despite that its proximity to us.

The second thing that the author states is that ""such an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of oceans and would liquefy many metals."" meaning that the temprature in venus is so hot that it would liquefy so many metals. The author says that "" tempratures would stillbe toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. not east conditions, but survivable for humans.""

The last thing that the text says is that "" Our travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovations."" meaning that when humans go to venus and they should expand the very edges of there imaginations and innovations, that they will discover wonders about Venus.",0
"Michelangelo, a renowned artist, sculptor, and poet, was known for his unwavering dedication to his craft. In his statement ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark,"" Michelangelo emphasizes the importance of setting high goals and striving to achieve them. In this essay, I will argue that Michelangelo's statement is true and provide examples to support my argument.

Firstly, setting high goals can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. When we set our sights on something great, we push ourselves to work harder and achieve more. For instance, when I set a goal to complete a challenging math problem, I felt a sense of pride and satisfaction when I finally solved it. Similarly, when Michelangelo set a goal to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling, he faced numerous challenges and setbacks, but ultimately achieved his goal and left a lasting legacy.

Secondly, setting high goals can lead to personal growth and development. When we strive to achieve something great, we learn new skills and expand our knowledge. For example, when I set a goal to learn a new language, I not only improved my language skills but also learned about different cultures and customs. Similarly, when Michelangelo set a goal to sculpt the statue of David, he not only created a masterpiece but also pushed the boundaries of what was possible in sculpture.

However, setting low goals can lead to complacency and a lack of motivation. When we set our sights too low, we may achieve our goals, but we may not feel a sense of fulfillment or satisfaction. For example, when I set a goal to complete a simple math problem, I felt unchallenged and unmotivated. Similarly, when Michelangelo set a goal to paint a simple portrait, he may have achieved his goal, but he may not have pushed himself to create a masterpiece.

In conclusion, Michelangelo's statement ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"" is true. Setting high goals can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, personal growth and development, and motivation to achieve even more. On the other hand",1
"Online classes have become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. They offer a flexible and convenient way for students to learn, and they can be especially beneficial for those who may need extra help when learning. In this essay, I will describe how one can access the help they need from a teacher in an online class, the reasons why it is beneficial, and the challenges that may prevent some students from getting the help they need.

One of the biggest advantages of online classes is the ability to access help from a teacher. In a traditional classroom, teachers may not have the time or resources to provide individualized help to every student. However, in an online class, teachers are often more available and able to provide personalized support. Students can easily reach out to their teachers via email, chat, or video call to ask questions, get feedback on their work, or discuss any difficulties they may be experiencing.

In addition to providing one-on-one support, online classes also offer a variety of resources that can help students get the help they need. Many online classes include video lectures, interactive exercises, and online quizzes that can help students reinforce their understanding of the material. These resources can be particularly helpful for students who may need extra practice or who learn at a different pace than their classmates.

Despite the many benefits of online classes, there are also some challenges that may prevent some students from getting the help they need. For example, some students may not have access to the necessary technology or internet connection to participate in an online class. Additionally, some students may struggle with self-motivation and discipline, which can be particularly challenging in an online learning environment.

Despite these challenges, online classes are still a good solution for students who may need extra help when learning. By providing personalized support and a variety of resources, online classes can help students overcome the challenges they may face and achieve their academic goals. In conclusion, online classes are a flexible and convenient way for students to learn, and they offer a variety of benefits for those who may need extra help when learning. With the right support and resources, online classes can be a great solution for students of all ages and backgrounds.",1
"Are summer assignments really fitting what a student needs best? Summer assignments consist of work that the students are requested to complete before returning to school at the end of summer. These assignments are created to ensure that the students continue learning during their break and is a great way to help the students excel in what they learned, while not being at school. There is an on-going debate whether or not these assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer assignments should in fact be teacher-designed, as it maintains the teachers standards for learning, grants the student prior knowledge for the upcoming year, and enables equal work for the students.

Some may argue that having summer assignments that are teacher-designed will be repetitive, not focusing on the students weak points. Though this may be true, it is easily avoided. Teachers can diminish this issue by meeting with the student prior to the school years end to discuss the topics that students needs more or less work on. This would eliminate repetitiveness and cause the student to become stronger in the topics he or she is weak at.

Summer assignments are a great way for students to not loose the knowledge they learned in the past year while learning new things that he or she may see in the future. These assignments should be teacher-designed to help maintain his or her standards. Without doing this, students would just design their summer assignments to require less overall work, having a more negative affect on the student. Maintaining the teachers standards would allow the teacher to assign the topics he or she feels is necessary for the student to learn and is not too easy or unnecessary. Maintaining the teachers learning standards goes along with giving the student prior knowledge as to what they might expect in the future.

Teachers have the best knowledge of what students will be learning in the upcoming year. This is a key argument to the claim that summer assignments should be student-designed. If summer work is planned out by students, they will not learn about topics they may see in the future. Having teachers design the summer work will allow them to include a sneak-peak as to what they may see in the year to come. This is very important as it gives the students an advantage when starting their new school year. Teacher-designed summer assignments would not just give the students insight into their upcoming school year, but also enable equal work between the students.

Students work very hard over the long school year. Teachers try their best to allow equal work for the students so that one student is not given more work than the other. Some students may not need as much work in a certain topic compared to others. Teachers will most likely assign said student different work from the others as it may be unnecessary for that student to focus on a topic they have already mastered. This often creates conflict between the students, arguing that they have more work than others. Teachers can attack this issue by working with the student to find out what best fits the students capabilities. A great way to do this is to give the students work based on what they need to improve on, but making the time it takes to finish the assignments equal. Examples of this include: giving the students that only needs to focus on one topic much more work in that topic and giving the students that need work on more than one topic a more widespread list of topics, but still maintaining equal time it takes to finish all of the work.

In conclusion, summer assignments should indeed be teacher-designed to enable the teachers standards for learning, prior knowledge for the upcoming year, and equal work among the students. This is a very important topic and should be discussed thoroughly when in the topic of summer assignments. I urge you to take this into consideration next time this discussion is brought up in your school or community.                        ",0

It all was work for the reach people because the family will all was check on them to no what they are do thing at home. If he don't work for them day will send Dem to schools because the want Dem to learning.

My only aided is some of the students will be benefit from this but some will not benefit from this because the one who will benefit from this all was check on there work day send Dem to do,some time they will be on the completion to check for the online classes they put most of dear time the students will take a back then day come back to check if the send them anything to do because the students want to pass this classes they signal for date.

The will was read some book all the time date will help them to no what the are doing. they students hew will not benefit from this will all was to be in the street because it very bad for some of the student don't want to do online classes and don't want to stay in schools you will lust most of the operate in school

Some schools want the students to stay at home but need to make apple will contend with the schools completion because they will trick the students if the students is work on the online classes he will be so nice for the students .But if the students is not work day need to celled the students to schools an asked way are you not work on your online classes .

If the students do not gave any aided day need to bring in back to schools then the students will learning in the classes.

schools is best way to have learning if you don't want to fall you need to be in schools then someone will help you to have good Education .But some students hew take online classes day need to help too to have good Education.

Thank you so much ",0
"If my principal was to make a plan about this with the students in school it will be a good idea for we can teach elementary students and other clean up litter. Tutoring elementary would be great for there school. because the students will learn more about there school subject and cleaning litter would be good for the environment and it would give us a good opportunity to show others that its good to clean up litter around where you live and also other places because we would have to care about how clean it is around us and also how we live because anyone wouldn't want the world to be a dump so performing community service would be very important but others would like the idea, so they would mind cleaning up garbage around them so the kids that would mind cleaning up litter around them can teach elementary kids so they can have a good opportunity to help the kids and also make the school a little better learning, also the kids that wouldn't mind cleaning up litter can do community service so my letter to the principal would be let the kids that wouldn't want to do community service to tutor the elementary kids for the elementary kids can do better and the people that would want to do community service can do that job for they can make the world a living peace and show other people that cleaning up litter can be good around your neighborhood and also a better environment a better place for others and know that the principal put up with a great idea, tutoring elementary kids and also doing community service which have would be a good idea. So I think the position I would be in is doing community service because i would like public areas to be litter free and also the people that would live around there would know what a great job I have done and they would appreciate the thing i have done. So the people that would live around there would know that i have been helpful to the community they live in.",0
"Have you ever thought about why you ask multiple people for advice? For instance,you wanted to know how to play volleyball but you don't know how so you go,and ask one of your family members that played the sport,and turns out your mom played. She tells you to be yourself and don't be scared,and then tryouts came and you did what she said but it did not work so now your upset,but then you go ask the coach yourself and she give you the best advice. She tell you what you need to work on and how to serve good then you take her advice, and it works you have an better chance to make it on the volleyball team. When people ask for advice,they sometimes go to more then one person because they have a better chance,or they feel like it's bad advice,and they feel like it won't work.

First,I said the main reason why people ask more then one person is to make sure they have a better chance at achieving their goals. I say this because people who ask for advice they need help achieving a goal that they had in mind, but they can't do it because they feel like the advice that you given them is not going to work. So they try another person who they think can make their goals happen. I also said this because I was in the same situation as other people I had to tryout for cheer leading. I never knew how to cheer so I went home and asked my mom and sister because they were cheerleaders before, and I thought that if they were cheerleaders before then they can remember some of the things to get me on the team. I listen to them closely so I wouldn't mess up,but as soon as I got on the court and did the cheer the teacher said that it was good, but it wasn't good enough to get on the team after that I went home and cried because I thought that I did good ,but then I had and idea to go and ask the coach for some help and she did. She helped me so good that I actually made the team I was really happy and ever since I thought twice about who to ask for help.

However,this leads me to my next reason of why people ask more then one person for advice. It's because they feel like the advice is bad. The reason I say that is because people who know good advice between bad advice know what path to take, but for people who listen to the wrong advice it can take them down the wrong road. I say this because people who listen to bad advice will get themselves in trouble with many people. For example let's say that you go ask a person for some advice how to make money. They give you the advice,but the advice sounds wrong in so many ways,but you still take your chances and do what the person said to do,and then you get in trouble. Because you listened to somebody who wanted you to do their dirty work,and who knew you were going to get in trouble by the police. Now your in jail, and they are asking you who told you to this, but you remembered that you were not supposed to tell anybody the name of the person because you agreed online. That you would keep the person who gave you advice anonymous, and you didnt want to break another rule so you sat in silence until you realized what you actually did. Then you started talking turns out that person has a criminal record and you were now apart of his trial.

Therefor,this leads me to my last reason of why people ask more than one person for advice. it's because they don't believe that it will work. I think the reason why people think the advice won't work is because someone already told you something, and it didn't end well ,or you just had things happen to you where you tried everything but nothing seems to work out. This can actually happen to anyone who is always second guessing their selves. For instance say that I ask you for a little advice for my project and you tell me to do a electric car project but then I tell you that I don't have the right things for the project, and then you stop helping me because I complaining,but it's not my fault I was just trying to tell you that I need the materials for this and when we made it I got an F because it looked to easy and this why people are afraid of asking people for advice.

In conclusion people should always seek more options because some people will listen to advice that tells you to bad things, and some people would listen to anything at all. and they should also seek more options because it can actually get you somewhere if you think that your not getting any progress and also not all advice is bad for you just because it might sound bad does not mean that it is some people really want to help people who needs it. and this is why when people ask for advice,they sometimes talk to more than one person.",0
"In ""The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports' his claims on how it is dangerouse it is taking the risk to explore Venus. The author uses various facts, proven by scientests, to justify his explanation. In this he talks about how ships can hover over the planet but not land on it because it is too dangerous. Venuse is too dangerous to explore.

In paragraph 2 the author talks about how Venus is very similar to Earth in looks, but is very dangerous on the inside. He says how Venus's size and density is very close to of Earth. But then he says how all the mission was unmanned because of one reason, which was none of them survied for more than few hours. The text states, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survied the landing for more than a few hours.""

Another reason that it is dangerous to explore Venus is because it is very hot on the surface and the pressure is too high. The pressure on Venuse is over 90 times higher than here on Earth. The Tempture on Venus in not too less either. It is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatues is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

Last reason for why Venus is wanting to be explored more is because we do not have a single sample for its surface. Our ships can hover over the planet and gather data of the atmosphere. But the atmosphere is too thick for light to go through. And as said before, the planet is too hot for a ship to last long enough on its surface. The text states, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannont penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photagraphy and vidography ineffective.""

In Conclusion, our neighbor plant or twin planet Venus is too dangerous for several reasons. The heat and pressure on the planet is too much for our space ship and our boby to handle. Not much can be found out about the planet because of its temperatures and its atmosphere unableing us to take pictures of iis surface form safe distance.",0
"Honesty is a hotly debated topic, with strong arguments on both sides. On one side, many people argue that honesty is always the best policy. They point to examples such as the importance of developing trust in relationships, companies, and governments. Honesty also shows respect for others; by being honest, we demonstrate that we recognize and value their feelings, considerations, and rights. The consequences of not being honest can also be significant. People often experience feelings of guilt, deceit, and shame resulting from dishonesty, leading to a sense of internal unrest. On the other side of the debate, some claim that there can be drawbacks to being too honest. This could include the potential for hurting others’ feelings or causing distress due to being overly blunt. Being excessively honest could also strain relationships, damage one’s reputation, and create an environment of mistrust.

Ultimately, the debate of whether honesty is the best policy continues. Both sides bring valid points to the conversation, and when making decisions, it can be helpful to weigh both the potential advantages and disadvantages.",1

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author supports the idea of studying Venus through research and data that has been collected thoughout the years.

The author made really good points about why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it may hold.

The author talked about why Venus is worth studying.

It is said in paragraph 4, that Venus, long ago, may have been earth-like.

It may have been covered in oceans and supported life.

This is defintely interesting to think about.

If it was like that long ago, why couldn't Venus be inhabitable for humans now?

On Venus, we would have enough solar power, and radiation levels wouldn't exceed Earth's.

I think it would be fascinating to study venus even with the dangers that it may present.

Overall, the author did a good job at persuading people to want to study Venus despite the challenges that may be faced.

There was a plentiful amount of interesting facts that the average person may have not knew.

After reading this article, I am not fascinated by Venus and what the future intails for us humans.   ",0
"I agree with the principal's decision of making extracurricular activities mandatory. I believe these activities are essential for students as it helps in their growth and development. It not only provides a chance to explore our interests but also helps in building social skills.

Firstly, extracurricular activities allow students to discover and develop their talents. Not all skills are learned in the classroom. Activities like drama, music, and art provide a platform for students to showcase their creativity. It also gives them an opportunity to improve their skills and possibly pursue a career in these fields.

Furthermore, these activities teach teamwork and time management skills. Being part of a sports team requires dedication and commitment, and students learn to manage their time effectively between academics and sports activities. Similarly, being part of the student council or yearbook club requires teamwork and leadership skills.

Lastly, participating in extracurricular activities can improve mental health. High school can be stressful, and engaging in activities can provide a healthy outlet for stress. It helps to improve overall well-being and promotes a positive school environment.

For these reasons, I strongly agree with the principal's decision to make extracurricular activities compulsory for all students. It provides a holistic learning experience and contributes to the overall development of a student.",1
"John Dyer was a man that had a dream of succeeding in an experiment he had put time and effort into. Despite failure after failure, John did not lose hope. He remained enthusiastic and persistent, and after a total of 408 trials, he achieved success. This story is an inspiring testament to the idea that success can be found through failure and hard work. Despite the losses and challenges, John Dyer kept moving forward, and eventually achieved his goal. His example reminds us that failure does not have to be the end of a story, but could be the beginning of something far greater. We can all take something from John Dyer's resilient spirit and take on life with enthusiasm and resilience.",1
"Everyone in the world makes different facial expressions everday. It's not necessarily something people try to do, but it is a natural way to express emotion. New technology called Facial Action Coding System allows doctors and scientists to evaluate people's facial expressions as a way of telling how they are feeling. Administrators should use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom because it is valuable in ways such as engaging students in lessons, being able to tell if a student is experiencing negative emotions, and it will help students learn about facial expressions and what they mean.

One reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom is because it would keep students engaged in lessons. In the article, it says that the computer program would have the ability to see when a student is getting bored or confused. Once it recognized this, it would reengage them in the lesson. This is the same things teachers do, but if a teacher was busy with another student, the computer just completed the task for them. This would be an effective way for students to continue their learning in an innovative way.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System would be useful in the classroom would be that the technology would be able to tell if the student was experiencing negative emotions. If someone knows their friend well, they are likely going to notice if they seem sad or downtrodden. However, if their friend is trying to hide their emotions, they might not even know something is wrong. On the other hand, if the computer systems were in the classroom, it would be able to tell if their were other negative emotions hidden from the human eye such as depression. This is evident from the article when it says that the Mona Lisa painting is, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry""(D'Alto). These results could be surprising to some because to the normal human eye the Mona Lisa seems completely happy and few would guess she's actually angry or fearful. So, this would help administators know if there was emotionally something they could do to help their students.

The final reason the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms is because it could teach students about recognizing facial expressions in people and what they mean. So, the technology is not only useful because it helps the students' emotional health, but also because it could help students help each other. If students learn how the computer tells how people are feeling, and they do the same, then the students will be able to recognize emotions and attain help for people they might think need emotional support. This would go above what humans are able to tell about how people feel on a regualar basis.

So, the

Facial Action Coding System would be useful in classrooms for a plethora of reasons. For one, it would recgonize if students were straying away from the lesson, and it would pull them back in. Also, the technology would be able to detect negative emotions within a student which could be presented to the teacher so they could help the student. Finally, the technology would be able to inform students on how to recognize emotions of people and could teach them all of the science and technological aspects of the sofware. This innovative facial technology could help students a trememdous amount in the classroom.    ",0
"Do you believe that a Facial Action Coding System or FACS is a good things and is accurate? Well I believe that this FACS could be a good thing and is accurate. I believe this because it is based on the computer being able to detect your emotions by your facial muscles. The computer will be able to know when a child is confused on the lesson, the computer will be able to see a person reaction to an ad if it is a good reaction then the computer will put more up like that or change it if you were not pleased, and this FACS will be able to make video games more realistic. This sounds like amazing opportunity to improve the way we do things in every day life.

For starters, I believe FACS can be a great improvement in evey day life because of the computer being able to change the wording or assignment based on the childs facial expression. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This will help improve test scores because the computer was able to modify the lesson so the student can understand. This can also help determine if a stundent will pass or fail the class because majority of the time students fail a class because of test they were not able to pass.

In addition, FACS could also be a good thing because it will help improve video games. I know what most of you may be thinking why would we want to improve video games so our kids or student could waste their time on the game instead of doing their homework or going to sleep early. This is not why it will be a good thing to improve a video game but it will be a good thing because it can help make a video or video game, surgery video, or be more realistic for games that have to deal with surgeries. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery,"" This could help improve the knowledge of a medical student or a high school student taking anatomy.

Finally, For those of you that hate and like certain ads your in luck. With FACS you are able to see ads that please you rather then the one that makes you just want to break the computer screen. With the new FACS software you can change the ads with the two most simplest facial expression, such as you smile then the next ad you will see is something similar to the pervious ad. If you hate and ad your frown can change the ad to an ad completely different. "" For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this is a good thing because people would not mind ads as much and it might produce sales based on if the person like the product in the ad.

In conclusion, Do you believe me now when i say t that the FACS software is a great improvement. I believe this because the computer will be able to change the lesson if the student is confused, it could change the ads based on two emotions, and making video games or surgery videos more realistic. I hope i persauded you to believe that FACS is a good thing for our everyday life.             ",0
"All the fun and games you've had is coming to an end like summer is, so finish it the great summer you've had and turn it into an amazing project for school! No more projects from teachers, summer projects should be student designed, more benefited towards the students learning abilities and their summer minds. Many students enjoy their long break over the summer and when the break is almost over they have to do a project for their teachers. Summer projects should be student designed as it would feel more creative coming from a student's perspective, they can keep their minds fresh by thinking about a project to do while having fun, and students can use what they've learned or seen over their vacations to design a good project.

Projects designed by students would feel more creative from their perspective. Many students have a surprisingly active mind at their age, as some can see more than just a picture. Students point of views of things are kind of simple but their creativeness is what makes their minds great. Designing a project from their perspective can be outstanding and turn out as a great project. Teachers would get a variety of different projects this way and could grade each one differently, instead of grading their own designed project repeatedly. This would also help the the teachers because it would be easier and more helpful the their students.

A project which a student designs can keep their mind fresh in the summer while they think about it and have fun. Relaxation in the summer keep everyone's stress levels down and they ease up more. Having a relaxed mind and thinking about a project to design in the summer will be very easy. Students can make a project on what they're doing in the summer like going on vacation with family, working a job to save up money,etc. Keeping a fresh mind is always important because it benefits you going into the year and keeping good grades to get you someplace good. A fresh and relaxed mind is always a good place to start work, as, more ideas and topics fly through your head.

Students can use what they've learned or seen over their vacation to design good projects. Students on vacation will probably go on some tour guides on their vacation to learn more about the area,its history, and see extraordinary things. A great project is what you already know and have the facts straight about the topic, and if students use what they had seen on their vacation and use that new knowledge about where they went, how it was like, what were the people like,etc, teachers would appreciate that they saw this project and feel accustomed to learn more about it. Students would love to hear that their project did very good and more people want to know more about it. Having a project designed by students that do great and show that these projects are more helpful to students than they are to teachers show the true benefit of them and how successful students can be.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student designed as it would feel more creative coming from a student's perspective, they can keep their minds fresh by thinking about a project to do while having fun, and students can use what they've learned or seen over their vacations to design a good project. Although if students designed their own projects, there's always the ones that are lazy and don't do school work and that the project will just be simple, plain, and of no benefit towards them. So, in my opinion, students should be able to make their own projects because, they would be more helpful to themselves than the teachers who are already learning more skills over the summer. Therefore, what is a summer project without some fun and great ideas in them.",0
"Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and its impact on people's lives is significant. The advancements in technology have brought about many positive and negative changes in various aspects of our lives, including relationships, buying items online, and spending time with family.

On the positive side, technology has allowed people to connect with others from different parts of the world, making it easier for them to maintain relationships. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have made it possible for people to keep in touch with friends and family who live far away. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, saving them time and effort. Online shopping has become more convenient, and people can purchase items from the comfort of their homes.

However, technology has also brought about some negative effects on people's lives. For instance, technology has made it easier for people to become isolated and disconnected from others. People often spend more time on their devices than interacting with others, leading to a decline in face-to-face communication skills. Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, leading to a decline in local businesses and a loss of jobs.

Technology has also impacted how people spend time with their families. While technology has made it possible for families to stay connected even when they are apart, it has also made it easier for people to become distracted and spend less time with their families. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to work from home, leading to a decline in the quality of family time.

Furthermore, technology has allowed people to complete tasks without contact with others, leading to a decline in interpersonal skills. People often rely on technology to complete tasks such as ordering food, booking appointments, and paying bills, reducing the need for human interaction.

In terms of children, technology has become an essential part of their lives. Children often use technology to learn, play, and connect with others. However, parents should put limits on their children's technology use to ensure that they are developing the necessary interpersonal skills and maintaining a healthy balance between technology use and other activities.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives, bringing about both positive and negative changes. While technology has made it easier for people to connect with others, it has also made it easier for people to become isolated and disconnected from",1

Studying Venus is Worth the Risks 

The author makes a strong case that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Several key points of evidence support this claim. First, Venus provides scientists with clues about Earth's early history and climate. Its surface resembles what Earth may have looked like long ago before life emerged. Learning about Venus can teach us about how our own planet formed and evolved. Additionally, Venus has valuable information about atmospheric conditions. It shows what can happen when a greenhouse effect spirals out of control. Understanding Venus's atmosphere may help address climate change on Earth. 

While Venus has a surface hot enough to melt lead and an atmosphere toxic enough to dissolve spacecraft, the scientific knowledge to be gained makes facing these risks worthwhile. With careful planning and rapidly developing technology, missions can achieve scientific goals with acceptable risk levels. Recent probe missions survived Venus's conditions much longer than expected, gathering unprecedented data. Future planned missions aim to directly sample the atmosphere and terrain, further expanding our knowledge. Though dangerous, exploring Venus leads to discoveries with broad implications for understanding planetary processes and safeguarding Earth's habitability. For these reasons, the author convincingly argues that studying Venus merits undertaking reasonable levels of risk.

In conclusion, the article presents compelling evidence that exploring Venus, while perilous, is a worthy scientific pursuit. Venus offers a unique window into planetary evolution and climate change dynamics. With diligent engineering efforts, its hazards can be navigated to reap rewards of new insights applicable to Earth. The potential scientific returns clearly outweigh the costs of carefully designed missions. Overall, the author builds a persuasive case that the study of Venus is worthwhile despite the challenges it poses.",1
"I think you should do the seagoing program because, you get to ride waves.

If I were you I would make my own choice not my friends choice or someone elses choice. When you are doing the seagoing cowboy program you get to go out and ride waves and play games at night time.

Another reason you should go is because you can learn things about the sea and the animals in it. If you already know a lot of things about the animals in the sea and the sea you should still go, because you can learn more and have fun at the same time. In the story it said "" Luke got to play games at night and he got a lot of time during the day to go wave riding"".

If you don't go on the Cowboys program I can't even tell you what your missing out on. I understand if you don't wan't to go, trust me I probably wouldn't it's not like I'm allowed to go anyway. I woud rather stay home than being homesick so I totally understand if you don't want to go.

If you don't want to go, but one of your friends are going or you don't want to go and someone is convincing you to just take some time to think about it and then make your second decision. Just remember do what you want to do, not what someone else wants to do.       ",0
"Taking advice from others can have a significant impact on our life decisions. Whether it comes from a mentor, parent, or guardian, advice can provide valuable guidance and help us navigate the challenges we face. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of advice, analyze an example of how it can make a difference, compare it to trying different types of food from different chefs, and explain how it can lead to a more successful and hardworking mindset.

Firstly, advice is an essential part of our lives. It can provide us with the knowledge and skills we need to make informed decisions and achieve our goals. Whether it's advice on how to study for an exam, how to handle a difficult situation at work, or how to manage our finances, taking advice from those who have experience and expertise can be invaluable.

One example of the power of advice is Abraham Lincoln's decision to end slavery. Lincoln sought advice from many people, including his mentor, Stephen Douglas, and his wife, Mary Todd, before making this historic decision. Their guidance helped him to understand the moral and political implications of ending slavery and ultimately led him to take action. Without their advice, Lincoln may not have had the courage or the knowledge to make such a significant and impactful decision.

Advice can also be compared to trying different types of food from different chefs. Just as trying new and different foods can broaden our palates and help us discover new flavors and cuisines, seeking out advice from a variety of sources can help us develop a more diverse and nuanced understanding of the world. Whether it's advice from a mentor, a colleague, or a friend, taking the time to listen and learn from others can help us grow and develop as individuals.

Finally, advice can lead to a more successful and hardworking mindset. When we seek out advice and take it to heart, we are more likely to approach challenges with a growth mindset. This means that we view failure as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than as a setback. By seeking out advice and taking it seriously, we are more likely to be proactive, persistent, and resilient in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, taking advice from others can have a significant impact on our life decisions. Whether it's advice from a mentor, parent, or guardian, seeking out",1
"Every person needs some form of transportation.

For most people that form of transportation is a car.

Cars are used not only as transportation but are also used for recreation and competiton.

Self-driving cars may take away from the recreation and competition parts and make the hobbies of many people become non-existant.

One could argue that roads would be safer with cars capable of driving themselves, but the reality is a computer is no replacement for a human brain.

A computer with all the little circuts and fuzes it has is not able to make a decision that solves problems beyond the one it is currently faced with.

Therefore car accidents will stil loccur and when an accident does occur who is to be held accountable?

Who wil pay the cost o fthe damage? ""Who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""(paragragh 9)

One cannot simply say that the the dumbest car is the one to blame.

Nor can he or she say that the drivers are at fault if they had no control over their car.

Driving can also be used as an escape.

Some people race their cars as a hobby and others just enjoy a nice Sunday cruise around town.

Either way they are not driving so they will not find the refuge from day-to-day life they seek.

What would be the fun of going to a track and sitting in a car you love and then have it drive itself around the track.

Pushing a car ro its max and diving into corners and accelerating out of them is what makes driving fun.

Without the roar of an engine reving at eight thousand RPM and the squeal of tires barely golding on to asphalt what would racing a car be?

A major issue with autonomous cars would be that of cost.

As the founder of the Google Car Project said ""Radar was a device at the top of a hill that costs two hundred million dollars.

It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack.""

The U.S. cannot afford a road system that will put us deeper into the sixteen trillion dollar hole we are in.

The price of cars would also rise making them for only people who could afford them.

A car with a higher price tag means a smaller market will be able to purchase them and less money is to be made.

Less money made means less money spent by the employees and that will make the economy worse.

Creating cars that drive themselves will take away from the hobbies of many people.

Transportation is a must in modern society.

Wether it is public or not people need to move from place to place.  ",0

When faced with an important decision, it is wise to seek advice from more than one person. Getting different perspectives allows you to gather a wider range of information to consider. Each person you talk to may have unique insights, experiences, or ways of thinking that could provide valuable input. 

For example, if you were deciding between two job offers, discussing the options with friends, family members, and coworkers could reveal factors you may not have considered on your own. One person may be able to provide details about the work culture or opportunities for advancement at one company that sway your decision. Meanwhile, someone else could warn you about potential downsides to long hours or a difficult commute associated with the other option. Perspectives from people in varied life stages or backgrounds may also surface practical advice or unseen complications.

Multiple viewpoints help ensure you don't miss anything important in your analysis. When relying solely on your own judgment, it's easy to let personal biases or blind spots influence the decision in a less than optimal way. Discussing the choice with others helps balance things out by bringing to light aspects you may have overlooked or underestimated due to being close to the situation. The collective knowledge of several informed individuals gives you a more well-rounded understanding of your alternatives. 

Seeking multiple opinions also prevents you from fixating too heavily on one person's advice if they happen to be misinformed or have an agenda you're unaware of. If most people you consult are in agreement about the best course of action, it strengthens your confidence that you have reasonably evaluated your choices. However, if viewpoints differ significantly, it may point to variables that deserve further exploration before deciding.

In conclusion, getting input from numerous trusted sources provides a depth of insight unachievable through solo consideration. Looking at options from a variety of angles adds clarity, ensures due diligence, and ultimately leads to a choice you can feel secure was well-researched and in your best interest based on facts rather than a single individual's counsel. Seeking multiple opinions gives you the benefit of communal wisdom for impactful decisions.",1
"Obesity is a growing problem in many countries, and it is not only affecting adults but also children. One of the main causes of obesity is the consumption of unhealthy food, especially during school hours. In this essay, I will explore the effects of obesity, healthy food options for school lunch, and how different cultures view food. Additionally, I will examine the consequences of unhealthy food choices and the financial implications of switching to healthier school lunch options. Finally, I will discuss the potential benefits of having healthier options for school lunches for both current and future generations.

Obesity is a serious health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of obesity has tripled since 1975, and it is now estimated that 39% of adults and 18% of children worldwide are overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with a range of health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.

One of the main reasons for the rise in obesity is the consumption of unhealthy food, especially during school hours. School lunches often contain high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. In addition, many school lunches are highly processed and lack essential nutrients, such as fiber and vitamins.

Different cultures view food in different ways, and this can affect the types of food that are available in school lunches. For example, in some cultures, it is considered important to have a balanced diet that includes a variety of different foods, while in others, it is more important to focus on specific foods that are considered to be traditional or culturally significant.

The consequences of unhealthy food choices can be significant, both financially and health-wise. Unhealthy school lunches can lead to increased healthcare costs, as well as decreased productivity and increased absenteeism. In addition, switching to healthier school lunch options can have a positive financial impact, as it can reduce healthcare costs and increase productivity.

In conclusion, having healthier options for school lunches can have a range of benefits for both current and future generations. By reducing the consumption of unhealthy food and promoting a balanced diet, we can help",1
"In 1945, World War ll had just ended. 44 countries joined to create the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration. The UNRRA is an administration that helps a country that has lost quite a bit in the war. The UNRRA helped countries that lost food supply, animal supply, and more. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to help care for the horses, young cows, and mule that were going to be shiped to other countries.

I think that there are many reasons that people should join the UNRRA. The first reason that I have provided for you is that This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The second reason I have is because even though you will be working you will be able to spend time with animals and you will see many sites that you would not have seen if you would have stayed home. The third reason I will provide is that not many people can do big oversea trips like that, a lot of people get very seasick. My final reason is that you would know you would be helping innocent people. You would know this because not everybody is in on these wars in fact most people are not in on big wars because they know it will tear apart their family.

I think that there are some claims that Luke has made that I should share. I think that one of Luke's claims that I should share is he said, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."". I think that he could support this because a lot of people, families, homes, and countries are destroyed and seperated. Another of Luke's claims was, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Accropolis in Greece was special."" I think that this can be supported because this would be truely amazing. I think that he did a good thing to choose to help the UNRRA, but being able to see Europe, China, and Greece would be incredible.

I think that Luke was a very incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"". I think that some details to suppot this are that he lasted 9 trips to nine different countries. This is incredible because that is the longest any ""Seagoing Cowboy"" has ever lasted. I think another reason he is an incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"" is because he decided to help the UNRRA. I bet that at the begining he was extremely nervous and I bet that he wanted to go home to his mom, dad, and siblings if he had any. My last reason that he was incredible is that he kept working even if he got seasick, or if he wanted to go home. I think that work was one thing that he used to get his mind off of things he worried about.

There are some thing that he could've done on the positive and the negative side. First, on the positive side, I thinkthat if he really set his mind to it he could've been a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" for at least 10-12 trips. I think that some benefits to staying longer would be that you would've been able to do more sight seeing, also you would've been able to spend more time with the animals. One thing that would be negative is that he would've gotten seasick more times than without staying.

I think that I would've signed up for this opportunity because I love animals and I really like being on the ocean. I think that this would be a great chance. I think that they should have things like this in 2016. I think that there are a lot of countries that could use something like this, one that I can think of off the top of my head is Syria. They could use all the help they could get, they could use food, shelter, animal products, and animals in general. I think that I would think the same way as Luke. I think that me and my friends would all sign up and we would do everything together. We would care for the animals together, we would eat together, we would sightsee together, and lastly we would take breaks and stop together. My overall thought is that this would be great but it would also be extremely dangerous.",0
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my view that the Electoral College system should be kept for electing the President of the United States, rather than changing to a popular vote. There are several important reasons why maintaining the Electoral College is beneficial.

One argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider range of voters across many states. Under the current system, candidates must compete in multiple swing states and cannot focus all of their attention on just a few highly populated regions. This encourages candidates to develop geographically diverse support and address issues important to different parts of the country. 

A counterargument is that the Electoral College can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. However, theElectoral College also helps ensure that smaller states still feel represented in presidential elections and that candidates have incentives to address issues facing these states too. Without the Electoral College system, candidates may focus only on campaigning in major cities along the coasts and ignore the interests of rural areas and less populated states. 

Additionally, the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states encourages candidates to pursue competitive states more vigorously. This leads to higher voter turnout in these swing states. If elections were decided solely by the national popular vote, candidates may concentrate turnout efforts only where they believe it benefit their candidate most.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College system is not perfect, on balance it encourages broader geographic representation and ensures that smaller states still have a voice in presidential elections. For these reasons, I believe the Electoral College should be retained as the method for selecting the US president. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 

I totally agree with Einstein that imagination is more important than knowledge. Like, think about it, right? Knowledge is cool and all, but it's just facts and stuff. But imagination? That's where the real magic happens. 

I mean, without imagination, we wouldn't have things like...  ...video games! Can you imagine a world without Fortnite?! 😱 Nope, didn't think so. And what about movies?! Imagine if we couldn't dream up new worlds and characters... 🤯 It'd be so boring!

But, like, Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."" 💡🔥 That's deep, right? He's basically saying that imagination is the key to unlocking all the possibilities in life. And I'm like, 100% on board with that.

So, sure, knowledge is important too. But let's be real, it's not as fun as using our imaginations. Think about it, when we're bored, what do we do? We daydream or play pretend! 🙃 It's like, our brains are constantly coming up with new stories and ideas, even when we're not trying. And that's what makes life interesting, right?

Plus, imagine if we didn't have imagination?! We'd never come up with new inventions or innovations! 💡🔥 Like, can you imagine a world without smartphones?! 😱 It's just too much to handle.

So, in conclusion, imagination is way more important than knowledge. It's what makes life exciting and full of possibilities. And, like, Einstein said, it's the key to unlocking all the magic in the world. 🔥💫 Thanks for reading, Mrs. Johnson! 😊",1
"I disagree that we must participate in a school activity that we might not even enjoy doing because we don't have to do something that we are not good at or generally, what the principal wants us to do. In every school, there are so many activity that you can do, but do you really have to do them? No, i don't believe so. Every student should decide on what they want to do. Not all students want to do activities that others want them to do. We should be heard instead of the principal or staff making all of the decision that we may not agree on, like having to participate in school activities.

There are so many different activities that we can do. Not all needs to be decided by the principal. Students should find a hobby or a activity that they think they are good at. Things out of school. Not everyone is perfect at doing a specific type of activity or sport. Every is different, no one will ever be the same as one another. They should choose something that they want to do, not what someone else picks for them. Let them see what they are good at and decide.

Other parents may find this upsetting. Some parents want their kids to join a sport or do different activities but what if there isn't any time for them. Most of these activities are after school and not everyone has time to do them. Other students have important things to do and they just might be able to do any activity. Some parents don't want their kid stressed and if there is just many things for them to do. An after school activity or anything related to that, just might not be right for them to do. Other parents want their kids to do a sport or serve on the student council but they might not realize how it can affect their kid. The same goes for the principal too. They said that all students must participate in at least one activity but what if they can't?

The principal should listen to students' opinions and what they want to do instead of having to do these activities that they told them to do. Every student has a right to state their own opinions and the principal should listen to them. If the students don't want to do the activities that the principal told them to do, he or she should listen to them. They all have their own reasons to why they decide to either do the activities or not. Maybe the school should listen to what they have to say. If it's important to them then it matters.

I believe that we should let the students decide on what they rather feel like doing. They should talk to the principal first. They should listen to what their students have to say. If they want to do an activity then they should. But if they decide that they dont want to have to do these activities or they just can't do them, to talk to the principal. We should all do something that we would enjoy doing but if we just don't feel comfortable then we shouldn't.",0
"I am agree whit those school who offer classes online because they are many student who want to be better in the life. Same students don't have the opportunity to be better in the life. Same have to work others have kids and they miss the opportunity to study in a regular school.

They are many peoples who want to be better, student who want to graduate early from high school or the university. It is better for those peoples who work and want to study an the same time. it is good for those peoples who get sick and they can't go to a regular school.

For example my mom she came at this country and she din't get the opportunity to go to school, because she have to work, after a few mount she star getting classes online, now she have a better job and a better life. she fine the opportunity there and she take that opportunity.

I think that in this country are many ways you can be better. It is better do classes from online or video conferency for those peoples who want to be better in the life.    ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that students should be required to do community service. I think it would be good if we help the community out like helping elementary students or cleaning up litter. Some students have nothing to do and just sit around and watch television all day. What could be better than to help your community out ? After school some students don't even go home and just go to there friends house and do nothing .Doing community service will keep you entertained. As a matter a fact it will also keep you out of trouble .We need cleaner parks. If community service is required we could go to the park and clean it up and it will be much cleaner and saver to be in and play in. If we help the elementary students and tutor them they will do better in school and actually turn in there homework and who know maybe because of our help they mite end up doing better in there CST .Doing community service wont take as much time. It will all depend on you .If you just want to do one hour or two. It will be up to you .Doing community service will help you out in life and you will all ready be experienced for any future job that you mite want or have. That's why I think that community service should be required.

"Dear state senator, I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight cowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are.

We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winnertakeall system in each state.

We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method.",0
"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are considering changing the school policy to require students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. I strongly disagree with this idea and I will explain why.

First of all, not all students are academically inclined and that's okay. Some students excel in sports or other activities and that's their strength. By requiring a grade B average, you would be unfairly excluding those students who have different strengths and talents. Everyone has their own unique abilities and we should celebrate and encourage them, not punish them for not being good at everything.

Secondly, this policy change would be unfair to students who are working hard to improve their grades. A student who is currently getting a grade C average may be putting in a lot of effort and showing significant improvement, but they would still be ineligible to participate in sports or other activities. This would be discouraging and demotivating for those students who are trying their best.

Thirdly, this policy change would be unfair to students who are facing challenges outside of school. Some students may have family or personal problems that are affecting their academic performance. By requiring a grade B average, you would be punishing those students who are already struggling with issues beyond their control.

Fourthly, extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs are an important part of a student's education. They help students develop teamwork, leadership, and social skills that are essential for success in life. By denying students the opportunity to participate in these activities, you would be limiting their ability to develop these important skills.

Lastly, this policy change would be unfair to students who are passionate about a particular sport or activity. A student who is passionate about basketball, for example, would be denied the opportunity to play on the school team even if they are putting in the effort and showing improvement. This would be a disappointment for those students who are passionate about a particular activity and would discourage them from pursuing their passion.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea of requiring a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. I believe that every student should have the opportunity to participate and develop their skills, regardless of their academic performance. I hope you will reconsider this policy change and find a more inclusive and fair way to support student success.

Thank you for your time.

"The face on Mars was not created by aliens. You may think this because it was on Mars, and some may think this was a sign of life on the planet. But, this is not true. It was not created by aliens, but by shadows. It was formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. As I said, this was just an illusion.

This happend 25 years ago, and people are still fussing about how this was created by aliens. This is impossible because there is no life on Mars. This ""face"" is just a natural landform. Many years ago scientists thought it was a sign of life too, but this was short lived. Soon after they thought this, they figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, where the spacecraft was circling when they found the face. This Martain mesa was just like the others, except it had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Soon after the scientists saw this unusual Martian mesa, they released it to the press so everyone could see. The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in movies, magazines, radio talk shows, and as the passage says ""Haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years"". This is a perfect example of why you shouldn't trust what you see on movies, online, or read in magazines.

In the passage it says,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hid, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars."" If you pay attention to the last sentence, it says,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars"", the key word in this is ""wish"". This is just more proof that this was just a natural landform.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. It was just another Martian mesa that had unusual shadows that looked like a face. This story and picture was released to the press, and people belived that it was created by aliens, and that it was a sign of life on Mars, but that is not true. This is why you should not believe movies, radio talk shows, and what you read in magazines. This shows that the ""Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens as a sign of life, but a shadow.

"Having a positive attitude in life can be beneficial in a myriad of ways. One of the primary benefits is an individual's mental well-being; those who approach life with a positive frame of mind are more likely to remain calmer and better equipped to handle stress. Additionally, a person with a positive attitude is a lot more appealing to others, increasing the likelihood they will build strong relationships with the people around them. 

On the contrary, there are those who believe a positive attitude is not required in order to succeed. However, studies have demonstrated that having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on the decisions an individual makes throughout their life. People who cultivate a positive outlook on life are more likely to pursue educational and career opportunities, helping them to reach a greater level of success. Moreover, finding the opportunity to learn from every situation can create a lasting advantage in areas such as problem-solving and creativity. 

To conclude, having a positive attitude in everyday life can have immense positive consequences. Not only does it help maintain an individual's mental health, but it also increases the likelihood of making better decisions that may lead to higher levels of success. Taking the time to cultivate a positive viewpoint can create innumerable long-term benefits that are well worth the effort.",1
"Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay about graduating early from high school. 

First off, let's talk about the benefits of graduating early.  One of the biggest pros is that you get to start college early!  Imagine being able to get a head start on your studies and potentially graduating earlier than your peers.  It's like, you know, you're already ahead of the game!  Plus, you can start exploring your passions and interests without feeling rushed or pressured to finish high school. 

But,  there are also some pretty big drawbacks to consider.  For one, you might miss out on important social experiences and memories with your friends.  Like, think about it, you'll be done with high school a year or two earlier than everyone else.  That can be tough, you know?  And,  you might face discouragement or criticism from people who think you're not taking the traditional path.  Like, they might say stuff like, ""Oh, you're gonna regret this,"" or, ""You're not gonna be ready for college.""  It can be really tough to deal with that kind of negativity. 

Now,  let's talk about some real-world examples.  I know this one girl who graduated early and started college at 16.  She's like, totally killing it!  She's got a full scholarship, and she's majoring in engineering.  But,  she also had to deal with a lot of criticism from her peers and even some teachers.  Like, they were like, ""What are you doing? You're too young to be in college!""  It was tough for her, but she'",1
"I think that drivers should not be able to operate while on the road because they can get easily distracted, they don't pay attention and could crash, they can fatally harm the people on the road. There have been a lot of different accidents because of people working on the road on their phone, or just not doing their jobs right from the start.

Drivers get easily distracted when using their phone to make calls for business.

According to EdgarSnyder. com the average amount of car crashes from using cell phones are about 1.6 million a year. The site also said that 94% of people support the ban for texting and driving. If drivers work on the road they are more likely to take phone calls or texts while driving, and that may result in a crash or an accident of some sort.

On average there are 1.25 million deaths yearly by automobile. With people working on the road that average is going to double faster. Being able to talk on the phone or texting while driving with more people adding everyday to work on the road the more people that work on the road the more likely there is to be an accident, and the more accidents, the higher fatality rate. People will quit their jobs to work on the road and make money, From July to September about 2.4% of people voluntarily quit their jobs. Of the 7 billion people in the world 2.4% quit their jobs and that rate will grow fast.

A lot of jobs that require working on the road like Uber, Lyft, Uber eats, Doordash, all have requirements for the job. Different companies have different ways of working, but most of the employees don't really pay attention to the rules because they think they don't need them.

For those who don't pay attention or follow the rules, they suffer the consequences. Driving is an important part of people and their jobs as they commute to work every single day. If there are any distractions that take away the commute then there should not be a lot of people working on the road.

In conclusion i think that people should not be able to work on the road. Drivers get easily distracted, they don't pay attention, they don't do their jobs. Working on the roads can get very distracting. Working on the road is very dangerous. It is very life threatening.   ",0
"Some schools instead of letting students have a break during the summer, instead make the students complete summer projects. Why schools do this is for the students to continue thinking and learning during the break. Most schools have the teachers design these projects, but the real way they should do it is by having students design them. The reason it should be this way is because it will encourage students to think for themselves, will let students learn and practice a topic they are interested in, and for the fact that a student can learn in a way helpful to them.

Independent thinking is a virtue that every single person should have. But sadly independent thinking is not something students get to practice very often. But summer projects that students get to design themselves is a perfect way for students to build and improve this skill greatly. Rather than the student half heartily completing a project that a teacher designed, the student would instead think up and complete a project themselves and will learn a great deal in the process. For example when I was in Tenth grade my history teacher had my class complete a project based on World War One, and those where the only instructions. If it had been a simple project where we each had to make a poster board for an event during the war. Instead each person in my class designed a project entirely their own. One person did a poster on trench warfare, another person came up with a song about how the war was started. I came up with a game that showed how hard it was to prevent the war. This project encouraged each person in that class to think for themselves and we were all better for it.

Having to complete a project about a boring topic can be brutal. One reason is that when people are not interested in something they can have a hard time doing it. A student designed summer project could be a perfect solution for this. The reason being is that instead of a student struggle to complete a project they don't care about, the student can and learn and practice a topic they are passionate about. For instance one time in my Filmmaking Class I got to complete an independent project on anything I wanted. My project was a film about cars, and for my entire life I have always loved cars and car movies. In doing this project I finally got to make my own car movie and in doing so I learned about a great deal about cars and film making it self. From how to make cars interesting to a viewer to how to film inside of one. This was an opportunity I was incredibly thankful for and will help me in my future of film making

One could say that if a student is given too much free reign on a project during the summer they will not complete the project or will make a half baked one. This is not true as all people and all students learn differently and require different needs and when given the time and resources will make something great. For example for me they best way to learn is by doing it through something I am passionate about. Like I love to bake and in my eighth grade civics class I got to make a cake about Presidential elections and because of they way I got to learn about it I still remember it to this day. This could be possible for every student if the project was more fitted for the students needs because that F average student could really be just struggling to learn and not out of laziness not completing the project but out of confusion or shame. As well as these projects would be during the summer the student would have even more time to practice and learn.

Summer projects that students themselves are a great way for students to learn. From promoting independent thinking, to having the student learn about a topic they are interested in, and the student getting to learn in a way helpful to them. These could really help students in getting ready for a new school year and the rest of their lives as these are skills not easily forgotten.

That is why schools should let student design their summer projects themselves.    ",0
"I don't think that the idea of a driverless car is a good idea. I feel as if driverless cars are just the fact of people being lazy. I don't understand what's hard about driving a car just for a short amount of time. Driverless cars might be a good idea for long road trips, but just think about how much work those cars would need if they broke down.

On the positive side these driverless car might be a good idea for someone that's always is on the go & they get tired of driving. It may also be good for the mothers of young children. Only when the child is crying the can have the car driving it's self while they get the baby in order. They should really make that a feature of the car. Other than that the car seems worthless & is just another car problem that us Americans would have.

Then we have the negative & I could go on & on about this one. Now having a driverless is just insane & lazy. First off what is the point of having a car if it's just going to drive it's self? I think it would cause more accident & like the article said; who's fault would it be the would the accident be on? Then insurance would be at an all time high, because the makers of these cars are going to find everyway to make these more advanced then the next, like I said in the first paragraph how much EXACTLY would it cost to buy A car like this or even fix a car like this ? Literally us as people only make enough to support our families & pay the bill. Having to buy these cars would be another thing to break us.

To wrap things up, in my opinion i think this car is something that they should second guess. It might benefit some people & others it might put a steep hole in their pocket. Once again i feel as if there is no purpose of having a car if you're not going to drive it.",0
"I am against the use of animals in scientific research. It is not fair to use animals for our own benefit without considering their well-being. Animals have feelings too, and they can experience pain and suffering just like humans do. Using them for testing is cruel and inhumane.

One reason why I am against animal testing is that there are now many alternatives available. Scientists can use computer models, cell cultures, and other non-animal methods to conduct their research. These methods are often more accurate and reliable than animal testing, and they do not cause any harm to animals.

Another reason why I am against animal testing is that it is often ineffective. Animals and humans have different biological systems, so the results of animal testing may not be applicable to humans. Many drugs that have been tested on animals have failed in human trials, which shows that animal testing is not a reliable method for predicting the safety and efficacy of drugs.

In addition, animal testing is often unnecessary. Many products that are tested on animals, such as cosmetics and cleaning products, are not essential for our survival. We can easily find alternative products that have not been tested on animals, so there is no need to subject animals to cruel and painful experiments for these purposes.

In conclusion, I believe that the use of animals in scientific research is unethical and unnecessary. We should respect the rights of animals and find alternative methods for conducting our research. It is our responsibility to ensure that animals are treated with kindness and compassion, and not used for our own selfish purposes.",1
"The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote.

The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by gallop in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an uptodate election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.

Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a nondemocratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.

Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.

In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.",0
"Have you ever wondered how you could make better choices? There are probably hundreds of ways to do so, but one way is more efficient. Seeking multiple opinions is a great way to make better choices. Seeking multiple opinions to make better choices can help because you get more knowledge if the problem comes up again, you have multiple ways to deal with that choice, and the person you talk to might have experience with what your dealing with.

Knowledge is always a good thing to have in tough situations. When you ask people their opinions on a choice, they give you knowledge on how to solve that choice. If the person your talking to gives you really good advice, and it works, you know the knowledge for next time. So now, when that choice comes around again, you know how to solve it.

Another good thing to have is multiple choices. If you ask multiple people for their opinion, you have lots of ways to deal with that choice. If one persons opinion didnt work, then you have other people ways to deal with the choice your trying to make. So, having multiple ways to deal with a choice is always a good thing.

Comparatively, there is another way to make a better choices. By asking someone who has dealt with the situation your in. For example, a therapist, a parent, or a friend could help you. The reason you want someone with experience with your choice is because they might know the best way to solve it. Thats why asking some with experience in your choice is always a great choice.

All in all, multiple opinions is always a good way to make better choices. Asking more people can get you tons of experience. Multiple choices are always good to have as well. Also by asking someone who has had experience with your choice. Thats why i think seeking multiple opinions is a great way to make better choices.",0
"What if you could decect what other people are feeling even when trying to hide it? Well,in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it explains how techonology called Facial Action Coding System(FACS) can identify human emotions. They use a computer that structures a 3-D computer model of someones face. There are six basic emotions they look for, happiness, surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness.

To answer the question, yes, the use of this technology would be beneficial in the classroom. Sometimes teachers have a hard time trying to keep students alert and paying attention, with this software, it could make it easier. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang say,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson , like and effective human instructor"". Since most human communication is nonverbal , including emotional communication, it could be difficult.

In conclusion, having the new software and using it in the classroom could be very useful to help shape the minds of students. Making dfferent faces and having different attitudes can revel so much about the science of emotions.

"Venus is the second planet form our sun, while Venus is simple to see from the distant vantage point we have here at Earth, it has been difficult place to examine closely. Venus is oftern referred as Earths ""twin"" and is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size this is why we should research Venus as a planet more. Venus is also relatively close to us so we should definetly invest more money researching even though there are some problems.

The athor states that Venus has proven many times before that it is not an easy planet to study. Each mission to land on venus was unmanned and for good reason, no aircraft would last more than a few hours. This explains why not a spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Many things contribute to Venus's reputaion as a challenging planet for us humans to study. Some of these things are a thick atmosphere of 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers the Venus, even more challenging are the clouds of extremely corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere and on the planets sufare the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atmosphere is 90 tines greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more intense than anything humans can find on earth. An enviroment like venus's Would crush a submarine accustomed to driving in the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy minerals. All these things plus more is why every mission so far has been unmanned, and why there hasnt been a singe spaceship that has landed in Venus in almost 3 decades.

Despite all of the potentially dangerous things about Venus there is still alot to benefit. NASA or The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an compelling idea for sending humans to study the cloudy planet. NASA's possible solution to the hostile condtions on the surface would allow scientists ti float above the fray and study without harm. It's a blimp like vehicle that hovers 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian. Hovering over venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. The author says ""Maybe we should think of them as challenges.""

By the end of the article the author says ""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only becasue of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""",0
"Hey, Mrs. Smith! Here's my essay on the advantages of attending regular classes versus online classes. I hope you like it! 😊

So, you know how there are these new-fangled online classes that everyone's been talking about? Like, how they're super convenient and stuff? Well, I think there are some major advantages to attending regular classes instead. Like, for real. 🤔

First of all, regular classes are way better for learning about other cultures. I mean, when you're in a classroom with other people, you can actually see and hear each other, right? You can ask questions and get answers, and you can learn so much more than just from a computer screen. Plus, you can actually practice speaking and listening to different languages, which is super important if you want to be able to communicate with people from other cultures. Online classes just can't compete with that. 🌎

Another thing I think is really cool about regular classes is how they help you gain confidence when interacting with people. Like, when you're in a classroom, you have to speak up and participate, right? You can't just sit there and hide behind your computer screen. And the more you practice, the more confident you'll become. Plus, you'll learn how to communicate with people in a way that's respectful and considerate of their feelings. That's super important in today's world. 💪

Finally, regular classes are way better for getting involved in activities. I mean, when you're in a classroom, you can see what's going on around you, right? You can join clubs and groups and participate in events, and you can make new friends who share your interests. Online classes just don't have the same vibe. Plus, when you're in a classroom, you can actually see the excitement and enthusiasm of your classmates, and it's way more contagious than just seeing a computer screen. 🎉

So, there you have it! Those are my thoughts on why regular classes are better than online classes. I hope you found them helpful, Mrs. Smith. 😊 Let me know if you have any questions",1
" The question of whether individuals should make their own decisions or rely on the guidance of experts with more experience and knowledge is a complex one. While some people argue that individuals should make their own decisions because they are the ones most familiar with their own lives and future, others believe that experts should be consulted to ensure the best possible outcome.

In my opinion, individuals should be free to make their own decisions, as long as they are aware of the potential consequences and are willing to take responsibility for their choices. While experts may have valuable insights and experience to offer, ultimately it is the individual who must decide what is best for their own life and future.

I have personally faced a difficult decision in my own life, one that could have had a significant impact on my future. At first, I was unsure of what to do and turned to others for guidance. However, I soon realized that this decision was ultimately mine to make and that I needed to trust my own instincts and make the choice that felt right for me.

Of course, there are some cases where decisions may not be made by the individual who will be affected by them. For example, when a person is a child or under the age of majority, parents or guardians are typically responsible for making decisions on their behalf. In these cases, it is important for the adults making the decisions to consider the best interests of the child and to make choices that will help them grow and thrive.

In conclusion, while experts may have valuable insights to offer, individuals should ultimately be free to make their own decisions. It is important for individuals to be aware of the potential consequences and to take responsibility for their choices, while also considering the input of others when appropriate. By doing so, individuals can make decisions that are best for their own lives and future.",1
"I think that students should only have to have a C average to play sports. I think that because as long as students are passing and not failing they should be able to play any kinds of sports. Also there are lots of other things that students have to do that don't involve school. For example a student might not have as much time to study if they are in a sport at there school. They have to go to practice which can be from an hour to two hours.

If they have a game they have to play in that night. Plus any other things they have to do at home like chores or watching there brother or sister. While if they didn't have all that to do they could focus a little more on there school work.

Another reason is that a C average is passing and not failing. There is no reason to make students have a B average to play in sports. It is already hard enough to pass all seven of our classes with a C average. I think that if you have a C average you work pretty hard to get that. Most students who have an A or a B average aren't in any sports ,or they don't have much to do at home like chores or baby sitting.

Another reason is that if you changed that policy most students wouldn't have the grades to play. If they do manage to get there grades up there would be a lot more stress in there life. If the students in athletics have stress then they might not play as good as they would if they didn't have any. If the team isn't any good that will just make there motivation in themselves go down which can make them feel even worser.

With all of that combined it would be really hard for someone to play in sports. That is why I think students in athletics should only have to have a C average to be in any type of sports. Like I said earlier I think that students should only have to have a C average.            ",0
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", author Nick D'Alto talks about the Facial Action Coding System, a new technology enabling computers to identify human emotions. In paragraph six he briefly talks about how it could work in a classroom setting and I believe that this would be a great new idea to bring into the school systems.

In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto starts explaining the Facial Action Ciding System by talking about all of it's potential, like how it can recognize even subtle facial movements and how it works will all 44 major muscles in our face. He then talks about all the places where this softwear would be useful like being able to tell if someone , like an important politician, is tellikg the truth or not.

Although he only brings the subject up once, he talks about how in a school setting this softwear would be increadibly uesful to help teach students more by knowing when they are confussed or borded. If teachers had access to infromation like this they would know when a leason is becoming too much for their students and be able to move on or explain it better. I think that this would be one of the most efficient ways to learn properly in school.

Let say a student has been out of it and sudenly realizes he has no idea whats going on during an important leason in his english class, but he doesn't want to say anything to his teacher because he's afraed he'll get in trubble, or maybe he's just to lazy to ask. That student won't have any idea of what to do for the rest of class. If schools had the Facial Action Coding System then the teacher would know right away that the student had not been paying attention and would be able to go back and explain again.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to the learning world. Students would never again have to sit through a class and have no idea what was going on because before they got too confused the system would let the teacher know. ",0

"As a student in grade 10, I strongly believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers. This is because students are the ones who spend the most time with teachers, and are therefore in the best position to evaluate their effectiveness.

One of the main reasons why students should be able to grade their teachers is that it would help to improve the quality of education. If teachers knew that their students were evaluating them, they would be more motivated to provide the best possible learning experience. This would lead to better lesson plans, more engaging classroom activities, and a greater focus on individual student needs. For example, my math teacher, Mr. Johnson, is very effective in teaching us new concepts because he takes the time to explain things clearly and provides plenty of practice exercises. If we were able to grade him, I would give him an A+ for his efforts.

Another reason why students should be able to grade their teachers is that it would help to create a more accountable educational system. Currently, teachers are often evaluated based on standardized test scores, which do not always accurately reflect a teacher's effectiveness. By allowing students to evaluate their teachers, we would have a more comprehensive view of a teacher's performance. For instance, my English teacher, Mrs. Smith, is very good at preparing us for standardized tests, but she does not provide enough opportunities for creative writing. If we were able to grade her, I would give her a B+ for her test preparation, but a C- for her lack of creative writing assignments.

Furthermore, student evaluations of teachers would help to promote a better relationship between students and teachers. If teachers knew that their students were evaluating them, they would be more likely to listen to student feedback and make changes accordingly. This would create a more collaborative learning environment, where students feel heard and valued. For example, my science teacher, Mr. Thompson, is very approachable and open to feedback. He often asks us for suggestions on how to improve his lessons, and takes our suggestions seriously. If we were able to grade him, I would give him an A for his willingness to listen to us.

However, some people argue that students are not mature enough to evaluate their teachers effectively. They claim that students may grade teachers based on personal biases, rather than on their actual performance. While this may be true in some cases, I believe that most students are capable of providing thoughtful and accurate evaluations. After all, we are the ones who spend the most time with our teachers, and we are therefore in the best position to evaluate their effectiveness.

In conclusion, student evaluations of teachers would be a valuable tool for improving the quality of education, creating a more accountable educational system, and promoting a better relationship between students and teachers. While there may be some concerns about the maturity of students, I believe that most students are capable of providing thoughtful and accurate evaluations. Therefore, I strongly argue that students should have the right to grade their teachers.",1
"Hello Mr. Senator,

I was writting to inform you about a topic that has been talked about for the past year, the Electoral Collage. This process has its pros and cons, but i'm more in the con side; you see the reason why the Electoral College needs to be abolished is because people dont really get to choose who their president is, the people who choose the president are the people in the Electoral College. How the Electoral College works is the state has electors and those electors have to be won by the president for the president to have how many electoral votes he gets from that state depending on how many electors that state has. The trick here is that sometimes the electors can deny the will of the people since the election is based on electoral votes not on popular votes, don't get me wrong people's votes do influence electors in deciding which president won their votes. Overall the electoral college is unfair to everyone because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states that they have no chance winning over so they got to the ""swing"" states since they have more chance of winning them over depending on their campaing. I don't think we should be trusting people to vote for us because as we have seen some electors vote for the candidate they want to win and not the candidate their state wants to win. Thats my rant about the Electoral College and I hope it makes you see clearer.

Best Regards, Alberto             ",0
"Should students be allowed to have cell phones during school? I think that students shouldn't be able to have cell phones at school at all because first its to distracting and the student wont be learning anything because he/she would be occupied doing something there not supposed to be doing. Second is school is a leaning environment not a place to be doing other things with your cell phone we come to school to learn! The third why i think having cell phones on campus is because we all have ore free time to do whatever we have to do.

The first reason why i think havening cell phones on school campus is because its really distracting and we wont learn anything because well be occupied on our cell phones. For example , we need to forces on more important things such as school work and maybe after school activates. I think we shouldn't be able to have our phones because 50% of students that have cell phones fail there classes because while the teacher is explaining something important the student us either messing around or texting another student which is not only affecting he/she but others around them.

The second reason why i think cell phones shouldn't be allowed on school campus is because school is a place to learn not use your phone in class. We come to school for one reason and one reason only at that is to go to school and get the education we need for a better future and all of the above. We need to help all students get ahead of life and have good jobs that they could all be proud of.

The third reason why i think having cell phones at school is a bad idea is because we all have free time i do understand we also have to have a social life and communicate with other students or peers. Not everything is fun and games sometimes we just need to expect the what our parents do what they do because they love and care about us.

We shouldn't be able to have cell phones because honestly its just a waste of time and we could do so much better and if we do a good job in school than we would have time for other things because in life there is time for everything but it also has its own time. we shoulnt be abl",0
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Um, so, like, I tried to write this essay about how I want to improve myself and stuff. I know I'm not the best writer or anything, but I tried my best. I think. 

So, like, I know I'm not the most confident person in the world, and I want to work on that. I want to be more outgoing and stuff, you know? Like, I want to make new friends and stuff. So, I've been trying to put myself out there more, like, talking to people and stuff. It's not easy, but I'm getting better at it. I also want to improve my writing skills, so I've been writing more and stuff. It's not as easy as it looks, but I'm trying my best.

I think if I can just keep working on myself and stuff, it'll help me in the long run. Like, I'll be more confident and stuff, and I'll be able to do more things. I want to be able to write better and stuff, and I want to be able to talk to people without being super nervous. It's like, I want to be able to be myself and stuff, you know?

But, like, there are challenges too. Sometimes it's hard to keep motivated and stuff, especially when things get tough. Like, when I'm writing and I'm like, ""Ugh, this is so hard,"" it's easy to get discouraged and stuff. But I'm trying to stay positive and stuff, and keep pushing through. I know it'll be worth it in the end.

So, yeah, that's pretty much it. That's what I'm trying to do to improve myself, and how I think it'll help me in the long run.  I hope it makes sense and stuff.",1
"Hey, so like, I'm totally stoked to be writing this essay about whether it's better to go to school or take online classes. I mean, I know some people think that school is the only way to go, but I think there are some pretty cool pros to taking online classes too.

First of all, let's talk about social life. I mean, who wants to be stuck in a classroom all day with the same people every day? It's like, super boring. But when you take online classes, you can learn from the comfort of your own home, or like, wherever you want. You can hang out with your friends, or go to the mall, or whatever. It's way more fun. Plus, you can make new friends online, which is like, totally possible.

But, like, there are some cons to online classes too. One of them is that you don't get to have as much responsibility. When you're in school, you have to go to class every day and pay attention and stuff. But when you're taking online classes, you can just like, not show up if you don't feel like it. And that's like, not good for you, you know? You need to be responsible and stuff.

Another con is that you don't get to eat as well when you're taking online classes. Like, when you're in school, you can just go to the cafeteria and get food. But when you're at home, you have to like, make your own food, which can be like, really hard. And you might end up eating junk food, which is like, bad for you.

But, like, the biggest pro of taking online classes is that you can learn at your own pace. Like, if you're really good at something, you can like, move ahead and learn more stuff. And if you're not good at something, you can like, take your time and practice more. It's like, way more flexible than school.

So, like, in conclusion, I think that both school and online classes have their pros and cons. But, like, if I had to choose, I would say that taking online classes is way better. You get to have more fun, be more responsible, and",1
"True self-esteem comes from achievement – the knowledge that one has changed the world in some tangible way, even if only in a small corner of it. While lofty goals are laudable, even smaller accomplishments can be empowering and show a person the value of their contribution. Building a strong work ethic, taking on responsibility, and working towards goals can all contribute to the development of self-esteem. 

Praising great students in the learning environment can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage others to reach for their own goals. Praising students for their accomplishments creates a positive feedback loop, creating an outlook that emphasizes effort and hard work rather than perfectionism. It can help students take pride in their work and contribute to the larger culture of achievement. By recognizing great student work, teachers can provide a source of inspiration to the students they are teaching. 

In conclusion, the source of true self-esteem is achieved through tangible accomplishments that recognize and honor a person's hard work. Praising great students can create a healthy, motivational environment that encourages others to reach for their goals. By celebrating small triumphs and successes, all can appreciate the value of their work and develop greater self-esteem.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that extending the school day has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it can provide more time for students to learn and improve their grades, but on the other hand, it can lead to burnout and a lack of work-life balance.

One of the main benefits of extending the school day is that it can provide more time for students to learn and improve their grades. With more time in the classroom, students can receive more instruction and practice, which can lead to better academic performance. Additionally, students can have more time to complete assignments and projects, which can help them develop important skills such as time management and organization.

However, there are also some disadvantages to extending the school day. One of the main concerns is that it can lead to burnout. With more time in the classroom, students may become overwhelmed and stressed, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Additionally, students may have less time for extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs, which can be an important part of their overall well-being.

Another potential disadvantage of extending the school day is that it can lead to a lack of work-life balance. Students may feel like they are constantly in school, with little time for relaxation and leisure activities. This can lead to feelings of exhaustion and frustration, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

In conclusion, while extending the school day can provide some benefits, such as more time for learning and improving grades, it also has some potential disadvantages, such as burnout and a lack of work-life balance. Ultimately, the decision to extend the school day should be carefully considered, taking into account the needs and well-being of both students and teachers.",1
"dear principal,

I do not think that students should be required to perform community service. I do think that it should be highly recommended though. I think it should be recommended and not forced because some students actually do not have the time to perform community service.

Say your friend was on the school basketball team and he was part of the Spanish honor society, school would end at three he would have to go to a Spanish honor society meeting from three until four thirty then he would need a to do his homework for two hours then he would have a basketball game at six, then he would need to eat dinner when he got home and eight thirty and by then he would be too exhausted to even move let alone perform community service and he would have to repeat this every day until the weekend which he will need to sleep and do homework and also relax from a tough week on the other hand there are the people who go home blow off their homework and either hang out with friends or play video games, that is why I would highly recommend community service instead of forcing it. because it would be unfair if the people who are working constantly their whole week have to then perform community service after their long and hard week behind and a new one imminently coming. while it is completely fair for the slacking and un working people to take time out of their day to help their community from, a student",0
"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are thinking of changing the grade average policy from C average to B to participate in school activities and sports.

I absolutely love this idea but it could hurt our sport teams and our activities. It could hurt them because at least half of them have a C average which means they wouldn't be able to play and it could effect our school team. Our school events for sports are a big thing I mean a lot of people like to come and watch but if we were not that good because some of our kids were kicked off that would be sort of lame. For example, if our best player and also our biggest player did not have the grades to play he would be kicked off and we would not be that good.

I would like if it stayed as a C average to be on the sports teams because out teams would stay the same and be good. If you did bad on one test and it dropped your grade to a C that means you could not play and that's not fair. I don't think that's fair because everyone does bad on at least one quiz or test. I would be really bummed if I couldn't play a game or two because i did bad on one single test.

If they did change the policy I don't think it would be helpful because our sports would start to go down.

I think that everyone expects to much out of us kids, were just kids. When your a kid I thought you were supposed to have fun, mess around, and do stupid things? All I have to say is please keep it simple at a C average and it will keep everyone happy!

Sincerely,

Your student",0
"The president has been chosen by the Electoral college for a long time. The electoral college is a process not a place. It is a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. According to the office of the federal register, ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president."" Every four years the presidential election is held. It is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president. According to the office of the federal register, ""When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors.""

The Election by popular vote is when the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The Senate would choose the vice president. According to Bradford Plumer, ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives form California, who represents 35 million voters."" Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. Bradford says that, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" Because of the winner-take-all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.

We should change to election by popular vote. Why? Because it's much better than the electoral college. The Electoral college is unfair to voters. In Election by popular vote it's fair to the voters. Just like Bradford said, ""Wyoming representing 500,000 voters has just as much say as California with 55 representatives which is 35 million voters."" According to Bradford Plumer,""In 2000 seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" That includes Rhode island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. It's true, It's official the Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This is why we need to change to the election by popualr vote.

All in all not a lot of people like the Electoral college system anymore, including myself. We understand how it works and why we use that system. It's just unfair to all the voters. We need to change to a new fair way to elect the president. Let's change to the Election by popualr vote and make things fair. Let's make people want to vote and know that it's going to be a fair election and that no state will be above another. They should all be equal!    ",0
"i think it is very valuable because it knows if youre happy or or sad which helps in a lot of ways. another intresting example would be ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""and the technology is so good it can make computer animated faces more expressive accroding to the text and can too for surgery videos. and the computer may not detect your emotional communication but noted dr. huang said ""so computers need to understand that too.

""The proccess begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and all 44 important muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""it also says that we may some times not really know what is wrong with our friends and sometimes we can becaus of there facial expresion. or just behavior in general but sometimes they dont want to show that emotion or what is in them the computer can detect all of that.

so i personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldnt really express there selfs to the class as if they were with there friends. so all we would have to do is just by a sinlge glimpes on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happend. and she doesnt really know what to do so she seeks help from a counceler and she just checks what is going on with her and just by that maybe her whole life could change by checking the computer. tech is advancing a lot and is helping the sociatey positivley and yet negativlily but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but potive stuff.

"Cars may be a good source of travel, but, unknown to some, are dangerous to Earth and it's inhabitants.  Limiting car usage to bicycles, walking, or any other option is a good idea.  The reasons for this being that it makes traffic safer and, more importantly, reduces pollution.

To begin with, limiting use on cars makes traffic less of a hassle.  For example, in the text, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" the author of this source reports that the effects of not using cars is, ""-leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3 Selsky)  Notice how, even in a big city, the effects of not using cars are extremely noticeable.  If that car-free day makes it to EVERYWHERE in the planet, no more traffic-related nonsense will occur.  Furthermore, in the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" a citizen by the name of Heidrun Walter states ""'When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way.'"" (Source 1 Rosenthal)  Even she finds that the lack of a car makes life easier for her.  This statement, though some would prefer not to admit that they were tense drivers, is true, as being behind the wheel in a large amount of traffic could be stressful.  It is agreeable that the effects of not using cars shows how much better life would be if they were removed permanently.

In addition to reducing traffic, limiting the use of cars could decrease the amount of pollution.  To illustrate, in the excerpt, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer reports that, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Source 2 Duffer)  It is shocking that the amount of driving in that city caused so much pollution that they needed to enforce a law banning driving, a TEMPORARY law.  It is baffling how Paris didn't keep that law intact.  To add insult to injury, according to ""The End of Car Culture,"" Obama plans to curve the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, seein how ""-transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" (Source 4 Rosenthal)  Wow, driving causes such a large amount of emissions to the point that it is near the amount of power plant emissions.  It seems rather unbelievable, and some would wish that the article wasn't true, but the use of cars is practically killing humanity.  The point is that car usage is damaging Earth and preventing use would reduce the damage.

To wrap things up, reducing car usage would make traffic less of a risk and decrease pollution.  Perhaps it will make the planet a better place, or fail in the end and continue to hurt the land some would call ""home"".  Just remember this, when you continue to use whatever car you use, remember the dangers it may bring.

"After researching various ways to conserve energy and resources in schools, I've identified several possible projects and campaigns that can be implemented. These initiatives include installing low-flow fixtures in sinks and toilets, building student awareness of energy and water conservation through educational campaigns, and encouraging campus recycling efforts. 

In order to present these initiatives to the school board, I would recommend creating a proposal that outlines the goals of each project and campaign, the benefits of conservation, and a description of how each can be implemented and maintained. 

The school board may also raise the issue of extending the school day by two hours, which could lead to conflict between students, teachers, and board members. This could be managed through a survey that gauges the opinion of the school community and through a series of informational meetings to discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed extension.",1
"In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. If you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform.

I think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. My first reason is that only a few of my friends from NASA believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. I also think that this is just a landform because the photo that we took was not very clear and that could have made the landform look like a face.

I also think that this is just a land form because the time of year that we took the one of the photos. When we took the photo in 1998, we took the photo during the winter on Mars and it made Mars sort of cloudy and the Mars Global Surveyer had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the strange landform. Some of my friends from NASA were saying that some of the so called ""alien markings"" were hidden too.

My final reason for thinking that this is just a landform is that when we took the thre pictures and compared them, they all looked different from each other. The picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. The picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. The picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. Therefore, I think this is just a landform

In conclusion, I think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.      ",0
"Dear Principle,

I think that we should have policy 1. Because some kids actually know how to respect the policy and keep their phones away during class, and some kids don't. but why else would discipline be invented? if their cell phones are out during class, the teachers can just take them away; and if that doesn't help, then you call the parents; and I'm pretty sure they'll deal with that!

So, policy 1 really caught my attention; i mean, if kids are using it during classes, cant the teachers just take them away as discipline? Kids would really learn their lesson if they get it taken away. I hear my friends talk about it all the time... Like ""Oh my goodness Ashley, my phone got taken away by the teacher! I'm going to be in so much trouble if my mom finds out!"" And the only thing I tell them is, ""maybe next time you should think about that, huh?"" They get mad at me but whatever. Ha-ha, oh well! It's only the truth! If you take their phones away! That's like torcher to them!!!

Let's see, if you have a school policy that you can have phones on free time or at lunch! Wow; our school would be known as the coolest school ever! Maybe not the coolest, but we would be known as a very good school. Everyone always complains about how we don't have any freedom, i think every school does. But our school would be very known; and i can promise you EVERYONE would be talking. I mean, you already complain enough about how our school is known for bad things; if you have policy one, people would think that we achieved all of the goals that were set for our school, that we have good students. All that kind of stuff. Isn't that what you wanted our school to look like? To be like? I remember you telling out whole school you that you wanted us to be known as a good community? I think that'd be amazing! cause it's way better then how we look right now!

Now, if people are taking advantage of policy 1, you can deal with that by calling their parents. Some student's are VERY scarred of their parents sometimes. AND even if it gets to the point where it's really bad; then you can call the police for a meeting, or even to take away the phone during the whole school year! I know if i was in that situation, i'd be balling my eyes out! i would be so upset, it wouldn't be funny at all! I'd probably go through a depression! hah, but seriously; some kids are like, ADDICTED to their phone! Kind of like me! (;

So, i hope this letter help you figure out what policy you're going to have, cause i mean come on; I'm pretty sure if you asked the whole school to do a letter about it; i'm 90% sure, they'd all agree with me!(:

"NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's ""sister"" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that ""so called aliens"" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there.

One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. The ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.

That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. Notice photo two? Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars.

If you still do not believe me, then this next part will. If you think about it, why would NASA keep an amazing discover like this a secret? The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.

In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.",0

"Cars are an everyday thing, you need them to get to work, to school, to pick up your kids, but what happens when the cars drive themselves? People have long dreamed of cars that drive themselvs, but most people dont know that google has had them sence 2009. Those cars arent compleatly independent, they need a persion to control them, or rather ""help"" them, like on high trafic areas, or around crashes. there are many advantiges and disadvantiges to the automatic car, but should we have them? Well, there are many reasions we should.

Its no surprize that every single car is as save as phisicly posable. At google, there cars have drove half a million miles without a crash. thats because every car is compleatly loaded with sencers to keep that from happening, let alone the persion in control of the car. another amazing feature this car has is that you can not use the automatic drive without both hands on the wheel, so the driver must pay atenton. That also makes it imposable for texting at the wheel.

Its no secret that aoutmatic cars are the future, with its advanced safty features and its convenence. All this car really needs is suport. Tons of people are compleatly against this idea of cars driving themselvs, but they have no reason to. Its safer, and easyer. This car will only get better with time, so hopefully, everyone will come around in time. so know you know what happens when cars can drive themselves, the real question is, will my story drive you?

"Growing up in today's society, it is known that public schooling is the main source of education. Children are introduced to pre-school at a young age to gradually familiarize them with their surroundings and the outside world. Although it is not an issue being talked about, some kids are not given that opportunity to attend school at a certain age, or they are not given the opportunity to attend school at all. There are solutions to that conflict, such as introducing them to kindergarten or first grade instead of starting with pre-school and day care, or having an at-home teacher for home schooling. In most cases, especially in high school, teens are given the option to take online classes that benefit them as much as attending class in school would.

Enrolling in an online class or completely committing to online school is not that different from waking up at 6 a. m. every morning and catching a bus. Being able to take a class online offers one the chance to choose what classes to take and when they want to attend them. For example, Generic_School offers mainly sophomores the oppportunity to take health and physical education over the summer, instead of taking it during the following school year. That way, any sophomore who chooses to take that class over the summer would be able to choose another subject that is in their field of interest or even a class that is beneficial to their future career. The downside of that could be often be a fee, of course, considering that it is a class taking place over the summer while everyone else is enjoying their time with friends and family; however, not all online classes would have to be paid for.

At Generic_School, not only do students have the ability to take classes online over the summer, but students are able to attend classes online during the school year as well. A well-known community college in Generic_City is the Generic_School, which offers online classes to seniors who plan on taking dual enrollment, advanced placement, or even honors. Dual enrollment and advanced placement is important because it gives the student college credit for their classes in college. It is common for upperclassmen to take on that given opportunity and enroll in a class online during the school year, which not only gives them the choice to choose what class they want to attend, but when they want to attend it. For a morning person, one would prefer their class to take place at sunrise, and if one is a night-owl, they would then prefer to take their classes during the evening. In conclusion, it gives students more freedom to expand their interests.

It is understandable that online classes and or schooling can be hard on students, especially if it starts at a young age. Most families would prefer their kid(s) to take on the world with public schooling, but others would rather keep them sheltered if they believe home schooling is a better form of introducing education; nevertheless, it is still education at the end of the day. Any form of education is helpful to society, whether it be online, in school, with a tutor, or family members. Everyone is constantly learning new things everyday, and technology is advancing as the seconds go by. It is all based on preference and what is comfortable with an individual if they want to be a part of an online class or not.

Online schooling and classes can be beneficial because not only does it give students a chance to balance better time management, but it could improve better education purposes with college credits, meeting new people, form new friendships from different schools, and is an overall wonderful experience.",0
"Dear Principal,

Community service is a way to distinguish selfish people from selfless people. Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people. At our school we should enforce that kids have to participate in community service at least twice a year.

Community service makes people feel better. It is a very moving experience when you give food to someone who is hungry. It teaches you to be appreciative of what you have after you see someone who has nothing. It also makes you feel good inside. Having community service might change the attitude of some kids at your school.

Some people think that community service is useless or a waste of time. But in reality it only takes up a few days a year of an average persons life. To only make the kids do two days of community service is no high price for anyone. It even doesn't take up the entire day, only a couple of hours.

Community service helps people, makes you feel better, and is not a humongous time consumer. Anyone who has some extra time should defiantly chose to do some. No one has a busy enough schedule do not be able to participate. As the principal of the school please require students to do community service.",0
"I am wondering, why is this even happening? The principal is making a huge decision. Every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with the principal's decision to do this. There can be negative consequences with it. I think students should not have to participate because things would be complicated, the students may not have the activity they wanted, and it wastes more of students' free time.

I think students should not have to participate because things would be complicated. First, it makes slightly more work for the teachers. The extracurricular teachers would have an unpleasant time checking for students like a regular class would. Second, there could be a problem with some students. Since all students have an extracurricular activity, some won't even bother to do it, and they might mess around in that activity. Third, there would be more unnecessary trouble with that. It's not right to give out detentions to students who don't want to participate in something extra. Things could go wrong if all of the school's students have to join, but what about the activities?

I think students should not have to participate because the students may not have the activity they wanted. To start with, that already happened with electives. We don't want another thing similar to happen, so one is enough. Next, there would be students who are going to complain. There shouldn't be a school where the students give negative comments about extracurricular activities. Lastly, the amount of students that are not satisfied makes the activities look like a joke. What's the point of extracurricular activities when unsatified students are forced to participate in it? When all students are in an extracurricular activity, there are always some, or most, who don't get their wanted activities.

From the principal's point of view, I can understand that students should not be lazy. To prove that, students should be participating in extracurricular activities because they may have nothing to do but play their games. However, that only consumes more of students' free time. To support it, assignments and homework are known to take up a huge chunk of time. They have already been a problem, so why add another conflict that students have to worry about? Students could be using free time to finish their assignments and homework instead of the extracurricular activities they have to do.

This is why students shouldn't be required to join in extracurricular activities. Three main negative consequences can go along with that. Stuff would get more complex, the students may not have their desired activity, and it takes most of the students' break time. After all the details and examples that I have gave, I am able to say that extracurricular activities should be optional for students.",0
"Humans. One of the many smart species on planet earth. The species that seems to think they can do anything, including going to Venus. Although Venus is highly dangerous with its high temperatures and extreme clouds of carbon dioxide, it is a worthy pursuit that could be a great benefit for the knowledge of anybody living on earth.

The information that could be gathered is rather incredible. Already this world knows a few features Venus holds, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" It is so amazing to think that already we have this idea of a planet. With hard work and dedication it could be valuble, to further investigate our sister planet. Even though the conditions the planet are critical, we know the dangers. There is a benefit to the planet, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author knows what to say, because they know that the conditions are harsh. And great reward the sccientists recieve what they would need from this raging planet.

The value of this planet is not known only because there is not enough strive to make it happen. The ""human curiosity"" is what leads this planet to greatness. Scientist that want this mission, have to be willing to do whatever it takes for knowledge. They have to ""get up close and personal despite the risks."" Those risks will lead to everything that a scientist could hope for. There is no reason to not believe the author when they say the mission will be worth your while. Only because there is something magnificent about that planet so similar to ours. the author so confidently states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" They so beautifully say what is needed. Imagaination and the need to innovate, for future greatness, is so important for the challenges ahead. Although this world still has unknown factors, finding out incredible things about Venus could change science, and could change the world itself.

Venus is our sister planet, one of the closest to us. How has our natural kick for curiosity not taken over? Humans always want to know everything. Making it clear, there is no point in just letting this fantastic adventure wait. Danger is always a component in exploring something new, that is why humans are knowledgable and powerful. So scientist should not hold back, they need to bring all their smarts to this adventure, and really make something great. It could result in the most indulging finds.            ",0
"Limiting car usage comes with benefits for everything. It benefits the environment, yourself, and everyone else in the world.

If you use your car less or just use it when you need it, the amount of pollutants in the air from vehicle transportation would drop drastically. Vehicles are the second leading cause of pollution in the world behind factories. Cars are responsible for up to fifty percent of gas emissions in heavy traffic areas in the United States according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"". It is a very simple concept, cars produce gas emission, and using your car less can help protect the environment from pollutants.

The environment is not the only thing benefitted from limited car usage. You become healthier if you choose to totally lose the vehicle. Heidrun Walter stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage can also limit stress in a person. Besides being stress free, if you choose to walk to where you need to go, you exercise and do not realize it. Basically, if you want to lower your stress, not be tense, or be healthier, just limit your car usage and walk or ride a bicycle.

Vehicle accidents are a major cause of death in the world. So, if you decide to not use your car as much and just walk or bike, that is one less driver on the road. If the trend of limiting car usage and walking or biking spreads, the threats on the roadways will lower drastically. So in turn, using your car less can help keep everyone safe and help lower the amount of vehicle accidents and save lives.

With more people on the side walks, and less people behind the wheel, everyone can be benefitted. From stress to gas emission, everything can be solved with limiting your car usage.",0
"I agree with the principal because some school work may include working together as a team and if they do an activity like sports,they can learn now things like find different ways to score or if they are losing they find ways to comeback. And i think its a good idea for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because they can spend time with friends or you can join a club that can help you with your homework and if you want to play a sport,you can sigh up for a activity that doesnt need to tryout for that sport And if you want to get some college credits then you can sigh up for an activity that can help you get some college credit a good way to get some,there is multiple ways to get some college credits like a good one is learning a language that is a good way to some college credit. you have nothing to do after school you can join an activity that can keep you busy. And this is why i agree with the principal because it can help us in the further on in life.",0
"The Challegene of Exploring Venus

Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is a planet similar to ours. It is the closest on similiarities to Earth and scientificis plan to explore it. However, it could be a bad idea because it has a lot of pollution, high temperatures and weather problems.

One reason of why exploring venus is a bad idea is the pollution. The text says ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". It means that there is a great pollution that humans are not able to stand. If people tries to go to Venus they could probably die.

Another reason is that venus has higher temperatures and weather problems. The article says "" temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater."" It means that the temperatures are stronger than what we can stand. Humans are not used to it so it would be difficult and risky.

One more reason is the weather issues. The article says ""Additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthqueakes, and frequent lightning strikes to proves seeking to land on its surface"". The weather is a great issue since they could destroy everything. It will be so hard to explore, not even machins would be able to stand a strong weather.

In conclusion, exploring Venus would be a bad idea since it is risky for humans. If you still think that scientifics should explore Venus, you can look for more information on internet.         ",0
"After researching the opinions of family and friends when buying new shoes, it is clear that gathering knowledge from multiple sources can be hugely beneficial. Depending on the type of shoe, it is important to ask people for their ideas on which style is best, as well as tips on size and fit. This can help make an informed decision and potentially save both time and money. It is essential to ask people who are more experienced in the particular topic in order to get a better understanding of the specific situation. Consulting multiple people is a great way to gain a wide variety of perspectives, enabling a more educated decision-making process. Furthermore, consulting multiple people may lead to valuable insights that may have not been thought of before.

"Online classes or classes taken from home is an amazing privilege to have. Nowadays many college and even high school students have the opportunity to not go to school and take a class, but just stay in their house and just open up a computer and take the class online from the comfort of their own home. Online classes are very beneficial to students. Having online classes as an option students will be able to focus more, students will be able to go at their own pace to learn the material, and students are now sitting in an environment that makes them comfortable to sit in so they will be able to succeed more.

Online classes will cause students to fail. When given the option of online classes some students may take this as an opportunity to slack off and not get any work done. They might just say oh I still have a lot of time left and just procrastinate doing the work. And then the night before everything is due they might just rush on everything and not put much effort in it and get bad grades on the work. Resulting in them failing the class.

Having the option of online classes will allow students to focus more on whatever topic they are learning. When sitting in classrooms with other kids, people have the tendency to get distracted very easily. There are tons of classroom distractions in schools such as: The classroom door wide open, you would have the urge to look there every minute to see what is going on outside your class, same with if there is a window in the classroom. Another distraction is other students in the classroom. Some people have different ways in focusing, a kid might constantly click their pen to keep focus, while that kid thinks that that helps them focus other kids might think of that as distracting and annoying. Having all of these distractions in a classroom may cause you to not succeed in the class ending it in you failing the course and having to retake it.

Everyone learns a their own pace. Some kids are quick learners and learn a lot very fast, while others are really slow and take some time to learn. This ends in many teachers moving on with the curriculum if the majority of the class has learned. This is not the best thing to do. Some kids are just calm learners, meaning they are slow learners but if they need help with something they are not really the ones who speak up and tell someone, they just dwell on the topic for a while till they eventually teach themselves the topic. That is a terrible way for someone to learn. School is for kids to learn from teachers, students should not have to teach themselves what they are suppose to be learning from a teacher. So when kids have the option of taking an online class they now can learn all the material at their own pace and they have access to all the study sources that are available to them. Having this opportunity will allow student's grades to be high and they will have a smaller chance at failing.

The work environment a student is presented with matters a lot. Meaning the resources and atmosphere they are in reflects on their test scores and quizzes as well. Sitting in a work environment where there is no access to basic resources will effect greatly on students. Sitting somewhere where students can not sit comfortably will not show pleasant grades. Sitting somewhere uncomfortable will not help with focusing on what is being taught, because your mind will only think about how uncomfortable you really are and then results in you missing what was taught and then ending in you getting a bad grade on the test/quiz. Even when sitting in a cold room. If you are sitting in a cold room all you will think about is how cold you are and how you wish you were someplace warm so you would not freezing your legs off. The environment you are in when learning matters because if the atmosphere presented is terrible then the test and quiz scores will show the same.

Online classes will be a very beneficial option to students. With online classes as an option students will be able to focus more, students will be able to go at their own pace to learn the material, and students will now be sitting in an environment that makes them comfortable to sit in so they will be able to succeed more. Online classes will be the reason why more and more students pass their classes which will get them to go to college and or get them a degree in whatever major they go into. Online classes will makes passing rates for schools to soar high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",0
"Summertime is everyone's favorite time of year. School is out, which means no more waking up at 6am to catch the bus or staying up at unreasonable hours to complete assignments. Teachers no longer have to spend endless hours creating lesson plans or tediously putting in students' grades. It is a time that everyone can enjoy. However, it is not uncommon for schools to assign summer projects to their students, as that is how they ensure that students continue to learn over the break. Although, a question that is frequently discussed is whether it should be the teachers' responsibility or the students' responsibility to design these assignments. I believe that, due to the amount of time teachers put into planning for students throughout the year and the usual lack of control students have over their assignments, it would be appropriate to allow the students the design these summer projects for themselves.

An integral part of being a teacher is devising lesson plans for students every year. It is the most basic yet necessary part of a functioning classroom. Teachers create a detailed plan including what the students are going to learn, how they are going to learn it, and what is the time frame that they are going to learn it by. Then they apply that lesson plan onto the students until the next lesson plan is needed, and so on. However, imagine if towards the end of the year, instead of having to create a final exam/project in addition to summer assignments, teachers made the students design their own summer projects as their final grade. Of course, the teachers would enforce some form of structure and requirements for the summer project, but it would be infinitely easier on the teachers, and potentially more enjoyable on everyone involved. That way, teachers would be alleviating the stress of having to create an additional summer assignment, while simultaneously having a somewhat enjoyable final project for the class. Being a teacher is no easy feat, and while this by no means significantly decreases the workload off teachers, it provides a small relief for teachers at the end of the year, a time in which everyone is on the edge of their seat, waiting for that blissful final bell to ring and signal the end of another school year.

Students spend the large majority of their time in school completing assignments handed to them. Whether it be a test, and essay, or a worksheet, students show up everyday to school and get told what they will be doing that day, and it is often not something they are enthusiastic to complete. In fact, students rarely ever get a say or opinion in what their next time-consuming task will be, and often times if the students are uninterested in the task, they are more likely to exert less effort in it and submit unsatisfactory work, or in some cases, not submit it at all. In regards to summer assignments specifically, students often have little-to-no motivation to complete any academic work, especially when they just spent ten months prior working endlessly on school work. Taking that into consideration, students are significantly more likely to willingly complete their work if they design it themselves, as they know what interests them and what does not. They know what kind of assignments intrigue them and what kinds do not. If they are given the opportunity to formulate their own project, they will be able to devise it in such a way that is tailored to them specifically, drastically increasing their chances of doing well and submitting exemplary work. Giving students this control over summer assignments serves to make summer vacation a more enjoyable experience on both students and teachers alike.

While the idea of permitting student-designed summer assignments may appeal to some, there are still those who are opposed to the idea. Some may argue that if students are given control over their summer assignments, they might abuse that privilege and devise projects that do not meet the required standard, or may not reach the caliber of learning that they are capable of and require minimal effort. However, not only is that an easily avoidable situation, it is also not dire cause for concern. Teachers could very easily assign a rubric and a list of expectation that must be met in order for a student's project to qualify. The project could go under review by the teacher so that he or she can determine whether or not that project is permissible. In spite of all that, however, even if some of the students still abuse their privilege and make less-than-average projects, the teachers could simply just refuse to accept their project. Since the students did not comply with the regulations set earlier and refused to put in effort to improve their project, they should be held accountable. They could be required to either devise and complete an entirely new project that meets the standards, or the teachers could give them a failing grade. Whatever course of action taken should, of course, be up to the teachers' discretion, but the fear of students taking advantage of such an opportunity is unreasonable and invalid, and the positive results of such an assignments greatly outweigh the negatives.

In many schools, summer projects are likely to be assigned regardless, so what is the harm in breaking traditional norms and making way for a newer, more enjoyable way of learning that can be appreciated by everyone involved, simply by giving the students the power to create their own projects?",0
"Setting and achieving goals can be a challenging process. We must have the courage to move past fear and laziness and push ourselves to create and strive for short and long-term goals. It is important to find ways to take control of our mindsets, dealing with self-doubt as well as any negative criticism or judgment from others. Additionally, we need to develop effective strategies to motivate ourselves and hold ourselves accountable for our goals. To do this, we must focus on creating an environment that is conducive to progress and success instead of allowing ourselves to be held back by excuses or excuses. Once we have identified effective methods of setting and achieving goals, we can focus on developing resilient mentalities that will allow us to attain success time and time again.",1
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about the importance of being honest! 😃 Being honest is like, super important and can have some serious positive impacts on people, relationships, and society as a whole.

First of all, let's talk about how being honest can help build relationships. When you're honest with someone, they know they can trust you. Trust is like, the foundation of any good relationship, whether it's with a friend, family member, or significant other. If you're always being truthful and transparent, people will feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings with you, and the relationship will be way stronger because of it. Like, think about it, if you're always lying to your BFF about what you did over the weekend, they're gonna start to doubt your honesty and the friendship might suffer. But if you're always upfront and honest, they'll know they can count on you, and the friendship will be way better.

Being honest can also benefit people emotionally. When you're truthful about how you're feeling, it can help you feel better about yourself. Like, if you're feeling sad or upset, telling someone how you're feeling can help you process your emotions and feel better. And if you're feeling happy or excited, sharing that with someone can help you connect with them on a deeper level. It's like, when you're honest about how you're feeling, you're showing vulnerability, and that can be super powerful.

But the positive impacts of honesty don't stop there! Being honest can also help society as a whole. When people are truthful and transparent, it can help build trust and credibility in institutions and systems. Like, if politicians are honest about their intentions and actions, it can help people feel more confident in their leadership. And if businesses are honest about their products and services, it can help build customer loyalty and trust. It's like, when everyone is truthful and transparent, it creates a ripple effect of honesty that can have a big impact on society.

In conclusion, being honest is like, super important! It can help build relationships, benefit people emotionally, and even help society as a whole. So",1

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States presidential elections and urge you to consider the benefits it provides to our democracy. While there is an ongoing debate regarding whether to keep the Electoral College or change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democratic process that should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also contributes to this, as even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, minimizing the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents the entire nation. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign and gain support in various regions of the country. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on regions where they are already popular and ensures that they consider the interests of citizens from all regions. It fosters a sense of national unity by giving every region a stake in the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its focus on swing states. In a close election, where the outcome depends on a few states, candidates are more likely to pay attention to and campaign in these swing states. This results in more informed and engaged voters in these states, who carefully evaluate the competing candidates. This heightened attention helps in making thoughtful decisions and serves the democratic process by ensuring that swing state voters have a significant say in the election.

The Electoral College also brings balance to the political influence of large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on the number of congressional representatives and senators, large states have a greater weight in the electoral process. This balance is important as it prevents the interests and concerns of large states from completely overpowering smaller states. Through this system, candidates are incentivized to address the needs of a diverse range of states, not just those with the largest populations.

Finally, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner and avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College guarantees that a clear winner emerges. The pressure for a run-off election, which significantly complicates the election process, is thus diminished. This leads to a more efficient and streamlined election outcome.

While I acknowledge the criticisms against the Electoral College, including the focus on swing states and the potential for a candidate to lose the popular vote but still win the presidency, I believe the benefits outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College maintains a level of stability, promotes national unity, and prevents the political interests of certain regions from dominating the election process.

In conclusion, I strongly believe in the importance and efficacy of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. It upholds the principles of our democratic system by ensuring a certainty of outcome, representing the entire nation, giving swing states a significant influence, providing balance between large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your support in preserving this vital component of our democracy.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Students should not be able to graduate early. If students stay in school the extra year they have more opportunities. The fourth year of high school gives them more time to learn. It also gives them more time to explore different careers they might want to do. Students might be stressed out too much. It is better to take your time then to rush your career.

Students who go the last year of high school have more time to learn more. They can take more classes than those who would graduate early. The classes will be easier because they will be learning at their grade level, not a grade level above. They also won't have as much homework and classwork to do at a time.

The students will have more career choices to choose from. If they have more time they will be able to have electives that can help them choose their career. For example there is a nursing class, carpentry class, electricity class, welding class, and many more that can help them get started. If they can't take electives then they won't have experiences that may help them.

Lots of work on a students can cause them to be stressed out. Some students already get stressed by the amount of work they get in regular classes. Imagine all the stress they get when they are taking more classes at a time. They can get stressed by all the homework and classwork they get from all their classes. They might also have a job they have to get to save money for their college supplies like textbooks. Which gives them less time to do their work and study.",0
"The accomplishments of Mahatma Gandhi, Bill Gates, and Nelson Mandela all demonstrate that hard work and dedication can lead to success. Mahatma Gandhi fought for India's independence through peaceful protests and civil disobedience, which eventually resulted in India's independence in 1947. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University to form Microsoft, growing it into the largest software company in the world. Nelson Mandela successfully campaigned to end the apartheid system and introduce democracy in South Africa. 

Thomas Jefferson's quote ""I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it"" speaks to the idea that hard work can lead to success. This has been exemplified by these individuals, and is evidence that setting goals and working diligently to achieve them can lead to a successful outcome.",1
"There are many advantages to limiting the number of cars on the roads. There are many reasons to not drive as much but there is still a lot of driving. People are taking action in decreasing the number of cars still being driven. There needs to be a smaller number of drivers. Driving isn't a life or death deal, we lived witout it for tens of thousands of years,

There are a lot of reasons to decrease driving numbers. The most important reasons in my opinion are environmental issues. There are so many gases produced my cars such as carbon monoxide that hurt our atmosphere. The air has been filled with pollutants that are devestating our whole world. Too much exposure to certain gases can be fatal. Driving is not worth polluting and hurting our atmosphere.

Many places have alredy taken action in reducing the number of cars on the road. Vuban, a German suburb, has banned the use of personal vehicles. As a result, 70 percent of families who reside in Vuban do not own a car. They simply walk or ride bikes everywhere with only a few buses to transport the citizens. Heidrun Walter says ""When I had a  car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Paris did an experiment with not letting even-number plated cars had to find another way of transportation for one day and odd-number plated cars do the same the next day. Each violator was fined 22 euros or $31. They repeated that cycle for about a week. The amount of smog decreased drastically. Even Bogata has their ""Day Without Cars."" They've held the event for 3 years straight. Violators faced a $25 fine. In result of that, two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined the event.

In the past couple of years there haven't been that many new drivers joining the crowd. A study has shown that there has been a 23% decrease of new drivers between 2001 and 2009. I guess that people don't have the need to drive everywhere now. The number of miles driven was peaked in 2005. Ever since then people have been driving less. We are now at the same number of miles driven as in 1995. People also haven't been buying new cars as often as they used to.

All in all, there are many advantages of driving less. There isn't as much of pollution being created. If we stay on the same track, we can stop polluting the earth with as many harsh gases and chemicals. There would be more healthy wildlife as well. I understand that transportation is a must, but find more ecologically friendly ways to do it such as car pooling or riding the bus or walking. There are many solutions, we just need to find them.         ",0
"Title: The Unyielding Spirit of Winston Churchill: How Failure Paved the Way to Success

Introduction:

Winston Churchill, the renowned British statesman and leader, is known for his unwavering determination and unrelenting spirit. Throughout his life, Churchill faced numerous challenges and setbacks, yet he never allowed failure to deter him from his goals. In fact, his resilience in the face of adversity is a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of learning from mistakes. In this essay, I will delve into Churchill's life and analyze how his attitude towards failure contributed to his remarkable success.

Early Life and Failures:

Born on November 30, 1874, in Blenheim Palace, Churchill's early life was marked by several setbacks. He failed the entrance exam to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, and his first book, a novel titled ""Savrola,"" was rejected by publishers. Churchill's early failures only fueled his determination to succeed, and he continued to pursue his passions with unwavering dedication.

Political Career:

Churchill's political career was marked by numerous successes, but also several failures. He lost the election for the presidency of the Board of Trade in 1908, and his leadership during World War I was met with criticism and controversy. However, Churchill's ability to learn from his mistakes and adapt to changing circumstances helped him bounce back from these setbacks. He continued to serve in various political capacities, including as Prime Minister during World War II, where his leadership and determination helped to turn the tide of the war in favor of the Allies.

The Power of Perseverance:

Churchill's attitude towards failure was one of resilience and determination. He believed that failure was not an end, but a means to learn and grow. In a speech to the House of Commons in 1947, Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" Churchill's unwavering spirit and ability to learn",1
"In recent discussion, the school board has proposed adding one and a half hours to the school day. While making more school time available may appeal to some, it is important to consider the consequences associated with this change. For one, lengthening the school day can have a negative effect on student’s mental, emotional, and physical health. Students will become overwhelmed by the stress of a longer day and unable to learn effectively. This can lead to greater levels of absenteeism and dropping out of school. 

In addition, increased school time will require considerable resources. Funds must be allocated to pay teachers and staff for additional hours, and money may need to be spent on additional electricity, heating, and school supplies. With these costs, it is highly unlikely the school could offer an array of academic and extracurricular activities that enliven student learning and provide outlets for creativity and socialization. 

Finally, it is possible that one and a half hours of additional school time would not be used efficiently by students or teachers. With some of the work expected to be completed at home, students may be unable to access deadlines and guidance from teachers. Class sizes may increase, leading to reduced collaboration time and individualized instruction. This situation may put even more strain on the students and possibly lead to unsatisfactory academic performance. 

Furthermore, students may have difficulty using the extra time in the day to explore interests or engage in quality leisure activities. An already unsatisfactory work-life balance for students may become even more disheartening with the increase in school hours. 

Considering the potential consequences of a longer school day, the school board should weigh all options carefully before making a decision. As such, adding one and a half hours to the school day is an impractical solution that fails to address the issues of mental health, resources, and efficient use of time.",1
"America's great past time might now be just that, in the past. This isn't baseball though, it's the usage of our American vehicles. America was the frontrunner in the invention of cars and has the motor capital of the world in Detroit. However, We've come a long way since the model T and now it is time to move forward into a new, cleaner era of transportation. Cities all across the world have begun the process of minimzing the  usage of private motor vehicles to help stop pollution, and to encourage the use of public transportation. The trend is already upon us in America as well, as a study showed that between 2001 and 2009 the amount of young people driving has decreased by 23 percent. Life without cars has proven beneficial to many cities around the world and it is time to spread to all cities.

First off, limiting the usage of cars will vastly decrease the amount of pollution to our environment.  Recently in Paris, France the government banned all drivers with odd license plates on the first day and all even number plates the second during a two day effort to minimize the smog and pollution of the city. This method proved to be very effectiveas the capital decreased its congestion by 60 percent. This little experiment may seem like a very small accomplishment, but it should serve to be the precedent by which other countries can help stop pollution. If this was done once evry month in major cities around the world it would cause a major decrease in pollution. In the long term it shows people that having their own car isn't always necessary and it is better for the environment to use public tranportation, and or other means to get to one's destination. Bogota, Colombia also participated in their second anual car-free day. This was considered to be a huge success by their mayor and many other South American leaders came to witness it themselves. They were all thouroughly impressed by the programs effectiveness and have thought about implementing it in their own countries.

Secondly, limiting car usage will result in different city layouts that could prove to be more desirable and efficient. In Vauban, Germany they have decided to go nearly car free with 70 percent of residents not owning a car. Car ownership is allowed but the owner of the vehicle must buy a space in a large parking garage for 40,000 dollars. Many of the residents claim that they lived a more stressful life when they owned a car and are now much happier because of the sale of their vehicle. This has started a trend in Europe of small suburban communities going car free to help the environment and their lives. This shift into a car free world is sparking the idea for new city designs to make them denser so mit is easier for people to travel from place to place. Stores can be placed only a walk away on a main street as opposed to a large shopping mall that is along a large highway.

In conclusion, limiting the use of cars and motor vehicles would prove to be extremely benficial for our world and our society. It would help solve the pollution and global warming crisis by limiting the amounts of carbon dioxide we put into our atmosphere. It would also change the shape of our suburban life, making it easier for people to get from place to place while still maintaining their green lifestyle. An Earth without cars becomes an Earth with a more peaceful environment and a healthy atmosphere.    ",0
"My position on driverless cars is not approved. If the car is called ""driverless"" why would you still need a human in the car to be ready and alerted if an he/she had to take action in a serious situation. ""Designed to notify the driver wjhen the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.""

Since the car is a driverless car why would a driver still need to be ready and alerted when the car cant manage to handle something. As in paragraph 7 it states ""all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Well if thats the case then why call it a driverless car if you still need to be alerted. That would also mean that the driver is not allowed to slack off and that the rules before the human got that car will still applie. Both eyes on the road at all times and both hands on the wheel at all times.

It would cost so much money to build new roads for the cars because in oder for the cars to drive and move in perfect condition is to have sensors that can read the positive and the negative polarity as messages in the binary code. As said in paragrahp 3 ""they required massive upgrades to exsiting roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" To much constuction would be happening at one time.

When the option of smarter roads was crossed of the list, a new option came metioning smarter cars. ""They needed a whole lot more sensors."" That seemslike a great idea but what if a human drvies on to many bumps and a sensor breaks off? Who knows how much it cost to fix it or where you can even find another sensor to replace the one that broke. A sensor can miscalculate a turn or and turn another way and cause a crash only because one or more sensors miscalulated.

Another thing about the sensors. what about the winter time? What if the sensors freeze or just get snow on them are the sensors water proof? So that would also put the human thats behind the wheel in a huge risk of being injured. The sensors could not pick up any positive or negative messages it need to read the binary code.

Think about if all electricy just cut off in a specific area. Wouldnt those sensors need the electircity to read the binary code? Wouldnt the sensors need to read the positive and negative messages also? If there was an power outage then no human would getting bakc to there destination or home.

Floods can be a thing that the sensors could get a shortage from. When its constantly raining and the water is rising faster by the minute and the car is driving through all of it while its splashing uner the car the sensors could definitly messed up.   ",0
"Dear Principle,

February 9th, 2011

I have heard some talk about you reconsidering our schools cell phone policy. I believe that cell phone policy number one(to allow students to use their cell phones during lunch a free times) would be a wonderful decision for these reasons.

First of all, if students were allowed to use their phones during lunch and free times, it would make them happy. For some unknown reason, teenagers have some sort of special connection or bond with their cell phones. I think that if we could use our cell phones during down time, there would be less detentions given out for using phones in class because students would have a chance to look at their precious phones and just to talk to somebody in another class.

Secondly, I think that a good reason for having phones allowed in free time is that students would be less rebellious of the cell phone policy. If a student gets their phone taken away in class, it could just be for something silly like the ringer going off. Teachers always assume that they are texting and take the phone away. If the phone policy was that we were allowed to use phones in free time we could turn the volume down to silence without it being taken away.

Finally, students are always sneaky about texting in class, and there is almost always someone texting during class. When a students caught texting in class, teachers assume that they are talking about a test or class work. That is almost never true only because the last thing we would want to talk about is school. Adding on to that, most of the times we are texting our parents because we forgot our lunch or PE uniform. When a teacher's phone goes off in class, the worst thing that could happen is that they get a few smirks from the students. If they can text during class it is only fair that we should be able to as well.

In conclusion, I believe that the best cell phone policy would be that students would be allowed to have their phones during lunch and free time, as long as their cell phones were turned off during class time. this would be the best choice because it would satisfy students, make them less rebellious of the cell phone policy, we would not have to be so sneaky, and it would be fair between teachers and students. Please consider this policy.

Sincerely,

"Do you think that all students must participate in at leats one extracurricular activity in school? I disagree with this decision because, some students dont have a ride to pick them up after school, they migh have to babysitte there little brothers and sisters, also they might have some family issues going on. Some students might not want to join any school activity not even if you try to convinced then to.

Some students donÃÂ´t have a ride to pick them up if they participate in a school activity. They couldnÃÂ´t get picked up because, either their parents are at work or doing something very important. So you have to call one of your family members and hope one of them could pick you up. I had to call one of my family members to pick me up because, my mom and dad couldnÃÂ´t pick me up, I was so scared that no one was going to pick me up, but thank god that my aunt came an picked me up. Somtimes you might have to ask one of your friends parents or their older sibling that can drive to take you home.

Some students have little brothers and sisters they have to look after because, their parents have to go to work or their parents have to go do something real quick. For example your parents could go grocery shopping, go on a date and more. Your parents might not want to hire a babysitter to watch your little siblings because, they not trust the person with their kids, so they tell you to watch them. Most likely your parents have to work all week so your mom, or dad just ask you to watch your younger siblings.

Some people have family issues that they have to deal with. For example if one of the family issues was, my parents are all ways are arguing everyday and you have little siblings, wouldnÃÂ´t you go home and protect them and calm them down if they are scared? I would go home and do that if i had young siblings. Some students could have worser issues then that because, their parents could be getting a divorce, one of their parents could be getting abuse or someone could have died in their family and more.

So that is most of my resends that I disagree about all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school. Student have thing going on in their lives that they canÃÂ´t participate in any school activitys. Some students donÃÂ´t even want to try school activitys even if you try to convinced them gto do so. Trust me I tired to convince people to do school activty like play sports or even join the club, they just wont even try it. Anyway most people donÃÂ´t have a ride to pick them up, they might have to babysitte their sibling or they just have some family issues going on; Also their are even more reasons than mine to prove that all students dontÃÂ´t have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school.",0
"I disagree with the principal because most people can not do extracurricular activities, because they do not like the activities that are given to them or they do not like working with others, or they are overweight and can not do any sort of exercise most overweight people can barely run, or walk without breathing hard/ heavy but to be clear i am over weight but i can walk a decent distance without breathing heavy i can run for like 5 or 8 laps to be honest but back to the prompt, then there are people that are skinny but do not want to do anything and they do not like socializing with anybody they only want to be alone thats kind of what i do but i socialize from every now and then but we should not have to do extracurricular activities because the principle wants us to it should always be our decision and only ours and the principal should just respect that.

in my personal opinion we should always have a choice on what to do like if we want a tattoo or if we want to quit school the decision should always be up to us no matter what anybody says it is our life we shape our own path to destiny, and we may need the help of others on the way and that is just fine okay because everybody needs help in life even i do with somethings like i need help with my math, and i need help with my science because math and science confuse me now because math involves letters now and science i never really got but most people get everything about these 2 subjects but not me, and that is why i ask for help because we all need it like some people need help with sleeping or getting up, it is an odd process to me but to be honest but we need to have our own choices and our own say in the matter that everyone should hear and then voice their opinion, that is what we need to do now we could put it up to a vote but I'm absolutely certain that everyone will vote no to being forced to do extracurricular activities because, nobody wants to and if the principal does not agree they can suck it up because they got outvoted and that means the people have spoken that is what the majority of the students have voted on because, it is their right to make their own decisions and do what they want to do and everyone should respect that in my opinion and if they do not then say i do not care it is my opinion not yours and thats that and they can not say no to everybody's opinion, they might say it to 5 or 10 people but not all of the people and thats the beauty of the world because this is how the voting system works and it is a great system that we should not change it at all it has gotten us a lot of good presidents and a lot of great senators but the voting system got us my favorite president john f Kennedy, he was one of the best presidents for like 2 years then he got assassinated that was a pretty sad day i felt bad for his wife, but still the voting system is almost flawless so we should keep improving it and not get rid of it because i think getting rid of it a long time ago would have been crazy and we would have not ended up with the type of system we are stuck with today.",0
"Have you ever been on an amazing trip? Have you ever seen many amazing sites? Have you ever been on a long boat trip? Do you want to help people? Do you want to care for animals? If the answer is no to the first three questions and yes to the two other questions, then the Seagoing Cowboys program is for you. It is fun and educational for any one at any age. It is an amazing chance to get into this program and visit the unique places on the way to the adventure.

This is an amazing adventure I have been on it I have seen so many places and met many amazing people on the way. While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.

These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys.

Did you love the idea of these things? Do you want to be apart of these things? Do you wanna be a Seagoing Cowboy? These are only some of the amazing things I got to see and do while I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program. You could do them to you just have to join in on it. Sign up and be apart of it, it is amazing and so much fun for everyone. It could be a great experience for you just like it was for me. So join and be apart of the group or program of the Seagoing Cowboys.",0
"First of all, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 is requited to elect the President.

In other words, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. And that`s what`s wrong with the Electoral Project system.

For example: If you live in Texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you`d not vote for this candidate, but for a slate of 34 Democratica electors pledged to John Kerry. But who are these electors? Who picks the electors in the first place? Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always

The electoral College is unfair and irrational. Voters don`t want to vote for a bunch of strange people. The voters in fact, wanto to vote for someone who they had chose. We son`t want to put our decision on someone else`s hand, we want to be in control of our own vote.    ",0
"Driverless cars would be good in the future because nobody would have to spend money on cars when they can actually buy other thing that they need. The driverless cars would use half fuel today's taxis need. Which is going to make people save money. The driverless car would offer far more flexibility than a bus. The driverless cars could change the world in a positive way.

Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half million miles without crashing. People would be so curious about the cars that they would love to try them. People is getting to discover more and more technology which is fascinating stuff and a driverless car would be a surprise for them and they would like to know about it. A driverless car is something that television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves.

A driverless car could be a benefit for a lot of people. People been trying to make a driverless car since the 1950's. They couldn't developed because it was just too expensive. Now that the world have advance a lot in technology is the time to start making new stuff in the world. If a company would dare to do this is going to change the history of the world and it would be in history forever.

Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car Project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. There was no way that they could make a car like this before 2000 because they didn't have all the technology that we have today. The radar it was just too expensive.

The radar cost it was two hundred million dollars. If the companies now have all this technology around them why not make the driverless car.

In a conclusion, the driverless car is something that a lot of people wants to see in the future. It would make the people life easier. The driverless car would make history. The driverless car would amaze people everywhere. If it happens is going to be history.             ",0

The second reason is that You have freetime. on Paragraph 8-9 it Said that Luke and his Friends got to play Games. Who likes to play Games,all of us right! That shows that We don't just work,but We have fun. When We are tire all We want to do is rest and have fun. This is a fine Job.

and The last reason is that We get to see Horses And Bulls. if you are a Cowboy ,People see you as a Brave Person. You get to touch and feel a Bull. You get to feel the action you never felt before. being close to a Bull is something Incredible. It makes You look brave. People start to think good of you. We all like that people think good of us. being a Cowboy makes you a Brave Person.

so what Am I trying to say is that being a Cowboy is Awesome. You get to go to Places you never been Before,You have freetime,and you are a Brave Person That Gets to touch and feel a Bull. You Have all that in Seegoing Cowboy. try being a Cowboy,You will know how fun it is. it is not bad to try. try it.",0
"Have you ever looked a photo of someone and wonder how they feel? Yes well now you can Thomas Huang form the neckman institute for Advance Science at the University of Amsterdam. Im all for this Facial Action Coding Sytem. It could show us how people long before use felt when getting there picture painted of picture taken. people could know how family member and friends felt before they past away. what if we could know how animals felt with the FACS?

We dont know how people felt back then, we didn't know what they were going through, but with the FACS we could get a general idea of how they felt at that time in there life. Say you had a family member that passed away that you never met before but you want to know if they were a happy, sad, or mad person you could use the FACS to know so you dont have to hear it from someone else. Wouldnt it be cool to know what animals are feeling? If this FACS could show us how humans felt wouldnt you like to konw what your pets are feeling if your pet was sad and you didnt know,but you use the FACS you would know and then you and do something with your pet to keep the happy. Now you might be asking how does this FACS work well ehrn the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. examples your frontalis pars lateralis muscles when you raise your eyebrows you are suprised, your orbicular oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. these reasons i just listed are why i support the FACS!",0
"While the Facial Action Coding System technology described in the article has promising applications, using it to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom raises some ethical concerns that limit its value. On one hand, this technology could help teachers gain insights into how their students are responding to lessons on an individual level. By recognizing when students appear disengaged, confused or struggling, teachers may be able to adjust their instruction to better meet student needs. This could potentially improve learning outcomes. However, constantly monitoring students' facial expressions also risks invading their privacy and feels overly intrusive. Students should feel comfortable freely expressing a range of emotions in the learning environment without fear of being watched and judged. Moreover, facial expressions do not always accurately convey how someone is feeling on the inside. There are risks of misinterpreting emotions or making assumptions based on limited data. Before using this technology in the classroom, more research is needed to understand its implications and address privacy and consent issues. Overall, while this technology shows promise if applied carefully and ethically, its value is currently limited by legitimate concerns about student privacy, autonomy, and the ability to reliably interpret emotions from facial cues alone in an educational setting. With further development that prioritizes student well-being, it may become a more appropriate tool to support teaching and learning.",1
" When it comes to group projects in school, it's important for the teacher to recognize the hard work and effort put in by each student. However, some may argue that praising the entire class for their work is not fair, especially if one group has put in significantly more effort than the rest.

In my opinion, praising students for their hard work and effort is crucial in building self-esteem and confidence. When students know that their efforts are recognized and appreciated, they are more likely to continue working hard and putting in their best effort in future projects.

However, it's important to note that praising students for deficient work can lower standards and undermine learning. If a teacher praises a student for a project that is not up to par, the student may become complacent and not feel the need to improve in future projects.

In conclusion, teachers should only praise students for their hard work and effort when they have put in their best effort and produced a high-quality product. This will help to build self-esteem and confidence in students, and motivate them to continue working hard in all their classes, projects, and homework.",1
"The Electoral College should be abolished because citizens can't vote directly on which candidate they want. The electoral college is unfair because a candidate that wins the vote of the people, they can't become president if they don't have enough electoral votes. For example when Al Gore was elected, Gore won the popular vote but could not become president because of insufficient electoral college votes.

It is not fair to the people that their vote cannot count unless it goes through the Electoral College. The Electoral College bases on what the overall state vote is, instead of the individual voter, thus making it unfair to each voter if they do not get an equal say in who they want as president. Said in source two, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The citizens should be able to choose who governs their country. Direct elections are much easier than having an Electoral College. The voters vote, the majority wins and we have a new president.

In the Electoral College system, the voters vote of another set of voters who vote for the candidate of their party. The Electoral College way is much more difficult than having a popular vote method of voting.

In some cases,when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote, in source 3, ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college301 and 370 Electoral votes, respectively."" This could be a clearer solution to having runoff elections. Also in source 3, ""There is no pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the voters cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidentail election process, is reduced by the Electoral Collage, which invariably produces a clear winner."" The president should be choosen by what the people want. There are also some citizens who may be a republican in a democratic state and vice versa who's vote wouldn't even be considered because the Electoral College will be voting for the overall states vote. In a popular vote everyone gets a say in who our president will be.

Having the popular vote method is a way to give all citizens a voice in who they want their next president to be. It's also a way to get people involved with government. If everyone gets an equal say,Then the president is choosen fairly among the citizens instead of a group of electors that go by the states overall vote rather than everyone getting equality. After all, America is a democracy and the electoral college isn't very democratic.",0
"We should change the Electoral College to election by popluar vote. As its states in the text ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" When you vote for a president, your actually voting for a state elector. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote wont win the national popular vote, but that happens rarely. Over 60% of voters would prefer direct elections.

Voters doesnt vote for the president in the electoral college, they actually vote for the slate of electors. Wouldnt you want to vote for the persident you want except voting for the electors? Its unfair that some states has more representatives than others because if its up to to the representatives big states, such as California has 55 representatives which represent 35 million voters. So as a example if the votes are tied and its up to Wyoming and California to decide who is president, Obama or Romney, and if California representatives voted for Romney, then even if Wyoming representatives voted for Obama, Romney would of won.

They should let us (citizens of America) vote for president except for the electors. In my personal opinion, there would be a higher amount of votes per president. It'll be fair if the president would be elected by the most popular votes. The president that has thhe most votes should be the one who wins it all.    ",0

"My position on driveless cars are bad because i don't trust them. I have a couple reasons why i don't trust them. My first reason is accidents. Driveless cars could have a sytem malfunction and drive off course and something breaks and crash into somthing. This could happen to anyone such as police, buses, and simple pedestrians.

My second reason is too many driveless cars. If there were to make way too many drivless cars then it would alot of traffic because there are alot of cars who need a driver to drive. Such as if they were to go to the junk yard the junk yards would overflow and they would have to make more and more and less places to build houses or less crops for farmers.

My last reason is pollution. If aot of people bought all these driveless cars then so much pollution would comeup and take over the sky and people would get sick and die from breathing in the air. If they were to change gas into something else and something went wrong with the gas or something to run the cars, they would either blow up or cause to much pollution that they would have to refund all the people and people would stop buying these because they wouldn't trust them.

That's why i say no to driveless cars.            ",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that every act of kindness, no matter how small, is an important step towards finding hope, staying positive, and seizing the day. This is because kindness has the power to create a ripple effect that can change the world.

One of the most significant benefits of kindness is that it can help us find hope in difficult times. When we do something kind for someone else, we are reminded that there is still good in the world, even when things seem bleak. This sense of hope can be especially important during times of stress, such as the current pandemic, when it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and hopeless.

Another way that kindness can help us stay positive is by reminding us to focus on the good in our lives. When we take the time to do something kind for someone else, we are also reminded to be grateful for the blessings in our own lives. This can help us stay positive and optimistic, even when things don't go our way.

Finally, kindness can help us seize the day and make the most of our time on this earth. When we do something kind for someone else, we are also reminded to live in the present moment and make the most of the time we have. This can help us live a more fulfilling life and make a positive impact on the world around us.

In conclusion, I believe that every act of kindness, no matter how small, is an important step towards finding hope, staying positive, and seizing the day. Kindness has the power to create a ripple effect that can change the world, and we should all strive to do our part to make the world a kinder, more positive place.",1

"The Electoral College, established by the Founding Fathers within the Constitution, was meant to serve as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of citizens. What the founding fathers failed to see was the many outstanding flaws within the Electoral College. For many imperative reasons that cannot be avoided, elections must be changed to the method of popular vote, and the Electoral College must not be a part of the United states elections any longer.

The first and foremost reason why the Electoral College should no longer be kept in the U.S is because it will only lead to negative consequences. This has been observed in the past, and it must be prevented from occurring once more. One element of this disaster factor is that electors could defy the will of the people. Source 2 informs readers that state legislators are are technically responsible for picking electors. These electors could very easily decide to vote upon who they would like to see in office, rather than who the citizens want. The impact of this would be treacherous when the wrong person is elected as president. Source two quotes, ""Back in 1960, segregationsists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. How is that for a compromise between Congress and U.S voters? Furthermore, another way in which keeping the Electoral College would be disastrous would be seen in the case of a state sending two states of electors. Bradford Plumer reminded those in favor of the Electoral College that this has happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, enormous downfall was avoided because Vice President Richard Nixon, presided over the Senate, validated his opponent's electors and did so ""without establishing a precedent."" However, America may not be so lucky the next time this may take place. Senators in each and every state must open their eyes and really see what is happening in their country. The U.S must change its elections to the popular vote system, where all of these impacts will be avoided. The Electoral College does nothing for its citizens, and states may send two states of electors to it, and for these reasons, America will face a very unhappy situation if we keep this system.

Popular vote is a much better system than the Electoral College because unlike the Electoral College, it is actually fair for its citizens. America, which has suffered greatly to achieve equality and liberty is held back by one thing the Electoral College. This is suffered by the United states citizens because of the College's winnertakeall system. Through this, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Source 2 refers back to the 2000 campaign, saying, ""...seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" How can a president be properly elected with this system in place? Source 3 attempts to discredit this claim, aguing, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign..."" What they fail to realize is that those citizens may not even know who they are voting for! It is lucid that there is simply no valid argument for outting the fate of the presidency into the hands of a couple swing voters in a state. In addition, as far as being unfair goes, there are also unpredicatable scenerios that may occur in elections. These scenerios are far from fair to anybody. For instance, there is always the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that were to happen, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives where voting would be handed over to state delegations. Plumer quotes, ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to...unfair."" This would not happen if the U.S adopts the popular vote method, where the most popular candidate will win and reflect the citizens who placed him or her into office. The Electoral College is nothing other than unfair to the citizens who rely on it to elect their president.

For many reasons, election methods must be changed to popular vote, and the Electoral College must be disgarded. It will only lead to a profound disaster, and it is also extremely biased and unfair. The United States must take action, one state at a time, to reverse the negative path it is on. This is the only way the U.S can finally reach its long term goal complete prosperity.",0
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break to assure that they are continuing to learn even when they are not in school. It is debated whether or not these projects should be student designed or teacher designed, and I believe that summer projects should be student designed. Students may want to design their project about something that they are passionate about, something they wish to learn more about, and perhaps they may be more accepting of doing summer projects if they got to design the projects they complete. It is hard for teachers to plan and design projects for each individual student because he or she may not choose a project that the student would want to complete and then a negative attitude develops towards summer projects. It is important for students to continue their education throughout the summer break but it needs to be something that they are interested in and something that they wish to learn about. Teachers get to plan all of their activities and projects throughout the school year and students have no say about what they wish to learn about or a project they wish to complete. Summer projects are the perfect opportunity to allow the student to choose a project that is interesting to them and that they have a passion for.

If students were allowed to design their summer projects, they woud be more passionate towards it and be excited to complete it. Most summer projects that teachers design for students lack adventure and are the same boring projects they receive during school. Teachers design projects for their students all school year long and students do not wish to continue doing those same boring projects during the summer. If a student was able to design his or her project they would design it based on their interests and something that they are passionate about and that would result in an amazing project that shows heart and passion. A teacher rarely is going to plan a project that applies to each student's interest and instead just plans a project that is mundane that no student wishes to complete. Perhaps a student was passionate about art, they could easily take a trip to an art museum and design a poster or a slideshow about what they experienced at the art museum and then share their passion with other students in the classroom. Learning does not always have to be completing work in a textbook or doing a book report, it can be fun and exciting and something students have a passion for. If students were allowed to choose summer projects, it could result in more students being passionate about learning and some really amazing projects.

A student designed project could be something that the student wishes to learn about as well. If a student showed an interest in marine biology, he or she could take trips to an aquarium and construct a project about what he or she learned. It is difficult for teachers to know all of their students interests and what they would like to learn about and that problem could be solved quickly by letting the students design their project. If a student does not want to learn about the project that a teacher has designed for them, summer projects become a negative thing and no student wishes to complete them. However, if a student designs a project around what he or she would like to learn about, it sparks a level of interest that may not be reached if a teacher were to design the project. Most of the kids in school are learning the basics, math, reading, writing, science, and so forth. While some of these subjects may interest students some may be more interested in the human anatomy, marine life, and the study of different cultures and if a student could design their summer project they could travel and witness different cultures and their history, or travel to a beach or nearby river with countless number of wildlife. They could truly experience it first hand which is a better form of learning than anyone could receive in a classroom.

Also, students may be more open to completing a summer project if they were the ones to design it. Of course it would have to meet guidelines, but at least it would be catered to the student. When I was younger I was assigned summer projects and I dreaded them every year because they were mainly huge, thick packets of math problems. I had no interest in completing these summer projects and eventually I quit doing them. However, if I were able to design my project I would have made it fun and educational at the same time and I would have been more open to completing it. One summer my aunt took my cousins and I to the science museum and we had a wonderful time but we also got to learn a lot as well. I was about eleven years old when I took this trip and I will never forget all of the amazing things I learned as well as how much fun I had. Learning does not have to be strictly confined to completing packets all summer, it can be broader and more fun. If students could design a summer project that suits them and is fun and interesting, they would be more open to completing it.

In conclusion, students should be able to design their summer projects because, there will be more passion towards the project, it could be about something they may not be able to learn about in the classroom, and they would be less negative about completing it. Teachers do not know each and every student's interest or what they wish to learn about so it is difficult for them to design a project that is fun for every student so they end up giving out mundane packets every year. It is important to allow students to choose what they would like to learn about and further their education in during the summer because teachers choose what they learn about during school. It should be their opportunity during the summer to explore the horizon and further their education by doing a project they wish to do and that starts with letting them design their project.",0
"Dear Principle,

You are considering two policy's about having cell phones at school. The first, is to not let the students have cell phones at school. Second, to let the kids have them at school, but to not let them be on during class time. I strongly believe that you should let us have our cell phones at school ,and just have them off during class time.

I think that we should be allowed to have our cell phones at school, but not have them on during class. This is because, sometimes things happen outside of school that students need to know.

For example, say that someone's parent had to let the student know that they wouldn't be home when they said they would. The student would be able to check their phone during lunch and find out what they needed to know. Plus, kids have cell phones for a reason, and if we have our phones with us at school we will be able to contact people during the designated times about various things.

I don't think that you should make a rule that the students shouldn't be able to bring their phones to school for many reasons. I, for one, believe that children can be responsible if there are known consequences. If you are debating to not have phones at school because they might be texting, or using their phones to cheat during class then make a strict rule for it. You could say, that if a teacher finds you using your phone in class then there will be no warning it will just be taken away. If kids know that there will be a consequence then they will usually not break the rules.

Therefore, if you don't want kids to be fooling around on their phones during school then you can make sure that doesn't happen, but don't take away the student's rights to be able to contact people as, and when, they need. I strongly believe that students have the right to have their phones at school, if, and only if, they follow the rules and not abuse their privileges.

Sincerely,

"I say we all choose are own characteristic traits because everyone has a option. For example: The British naturalist John Lubbock was sophisticated person as one his characteristics traits therefore he had the right to write and read when other didnt have the choice. When John Lubbock choose to become an politician , but also a naturalist which he chose to become one. When John Lubbock wrote this prompt he took action to write it instead of be influence by others and becoming the same as them. Because if all politician were the same and influence by each other every time they would all be the same and wouldnt have made their mark. Back then I havent known a lot of British politicians that were naturalist as John Lubbock but, until now because he made his mark. People should have to make their own choices anyways because you cant work as a politician and always agree with what people say and be influence by it you have to make your own choices. In between that John Lubbock shows he's made his own choices about this and you as the reader to think about it also and makes a choice. When it come to talking about what characteristic traits we have its based on the person who decided to become whoever they want to become and control their out come in life. In conclusion the way were based on the way we act or show who we are, for are traits",0
"Learning something new and helping others every day is crucial for personal growth and the betterment of society. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote emphasizes the importance of taking risks and exploring new ideas, which can lead to personal growth and development.

One reason why it is important to learn something new is that it keeps our minds sharp and active. When we learn something new, we are challenging our brains to think in new ways and to adapt to new information. This process helps to keep our minds sharp and active, which can lead to improved cognitive function and overall brain health. For example, learning a new language can improve memory, attention, and problem-solving skills.

Another reason why it is important to learn something new is that it can lead to new opportunities and experiences. When we learn something new, we are expanding our knowledge and skills, which can open up new doors and opportunities for us. For example, learning how to code can lead to a career in software development or web design.

In addition to personal growth, helping others every day is also important for the betterment of society. When we help others, we are making a positive impact on the world around us. Helping others can also lead to personal growth and development, as it can teach us valuable skills such as empathy, communication, and leadership. For example, volunteering at a local soup kitchen can help us develop a sense of compassion and empathy for those in need.

Overall, learning something new and helping others every day is important for personal growth and the betterment of society. By taking risks and exploring new ideas, we can improve our cognitive function, open up new opportunities, and make a positive impact on the world around us. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.""",1
"Cars have been around for over hundred years. They caused some good and bad things. People use cars daily to go places. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.

To begin with there will be less car emissions. Ever since the first car rolled off the assembly line they have been polluting the air. As seen here ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter"" Duffer. From all the cars and trucks that Paris has, they have the most emissions in their air. Another example will be ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France"" Duffer. From experance working on cars the diesel engine give off the most pollution out of all the vehicles on the roads today. Since the air in France was getting to bad they had to ""Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31"" Duffer. The smog got so bad in the air that France had to take a good amount of drivers off the roads to reduce their emissions so the smog will be reduced. As a result from parking those drivers ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined"" Duffer. Today, cars are assories and people need their cars to go to work and cannot blame those people for doing what they had to do. One last example is ""If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" Rosenthal. Since people are using cars less the pollution in the air will decrease. The emissions had gotten to bad and its hurting our Earth.

Lastly is there will be less traffic on the streets. Lately people have not been getting their drivers license.""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" Rosenthal. The newer generation does not have the desire to drive and to work on cars like the generation before them. Another example is ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent were sold"" Rosenthal. 70 percent is a high number of people and that is a lot of people that are not on the roads. Since those people are in Germany this is what happen in France ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" Duffer. That is a huge decrease in traffic there will be no problems getting anywhere on time. Another key example is ""People park their cars in large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home"" Rosenthal. Since people do not have the money to pay for a parking spot they have to get rid of their cars and that will definatly clear up the roads. One last example is ""vaughn's streets are completey 'carfree' except the main drag to down town"" Rosenthal. vaughn's street are compleatly empty now hows that for no traffic.

In closing, cars have been around for a while now. They caused some problems and no problems. People use cars to go places daily. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.",0
"I am against the idea of students grading their teachers. While it may seem like a good way to gather feedback and improve the quality of education, there are several drawbacks that make it an unviable option.

Firstly, students may not have the necessary expertise or experience to evaluate their teachers objectively. They may be biased based on personal feelings towards the teacher or the subject matter, which can skew the results of the evaluation. For instance, I know some students who dislike math and therefore rate any math teacher poorly, even if the teacher is competent.

Secondly, student evaluations can place undue pressure on teachers to please their students instead of focusing on delivering quality education. A teacher who is more concerned with pleasing his or her students may not challenge them enough, leading to a decrease in the quality of education.

Thirdly, student evaluations can be unreliable because they may not accurately reflect a teacher's abilities. For example, if a teacher is strict and demands a lot from students, the students may rate the teacher poorly despite the fact that this teacher may actually be helping them to improve their skills.

Lastly, student evaluations can be time-consuming and costly. Teachers may need to take time away from teaching to prepare for evaluations, and schools may need to devote resources to the process of collecting and analyzing the evaluations.

In conclusion, while it may seem like a good idea in theory, the practical limitations of student evaluations mean they are not an effective or efficient way of measuring a teacher's abilities. Instead, schools should consider other forms of feedback from both students and other educators to help improve the quality of education.",1
"Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. I think this because students won't be so anxious to text in class or use their phone during class at all because they will just wait until lunch time or passing period. I also think that it would be much better because the students won't even think about texting in class. But if the teacher or you find them texting in class just take their phones away and have their parents come and pick the phone up. Also if it gets out of hand just change Policy 1 to Policy 2. Then again you never know if the student is texting in class for good reasons like if he/she forgot to write down the homework and they're asking a friend in an other class what the homework was. So those two policies are a tough argument but I hope my letter tells you something.

"Imagine not having to go to school early in the morning to learn. Now a days, online schools are becoming more and more popular. It makes sense because technology is becoming more and more advanced, so why not make school more and more accesable to everyone? Certain people have bad mobility skills because of their disabillities, so being able to stay home takes away the stress of having to try get around a huge school. Being able to take classes online creates a better learning enviorment because it is cheaper for the schools and It is more acessable for people with mobility issues.

High School teachers have to teach about 25 to 30 kids each class and that means 25 to 30 copys of each book, each paper, and each textbook. All those materials costs schools a lot of money, but if a student is taking a class from home the teacher can just post it online and students can see everything saving the school money. When I was in 9th grade I missed a month of school because I had to go out of the country, but I still maintained my above average grades because my teachers just posted everything online. Posting everything online saved the school money because they didn't have to print all the papers I would have needed for that month before I left. With the school saving money from less papers and textbooks, they can put more money into things such as the library, sports, and teachers pay. Teaching more kids more efficentaly should be every schools goal and with online classes that can be possible.

A school should tend to the needs of every child, and every child should feel safe and happy at school. With this in mind, certain kids who have mobillity issues might not feel safe at school. Kids running around in the hallway and elevators sometimes breaking are risks students with disabillities take when coming to school. Also wasting all that energy getting around school might make some kids less content and not want to learn as much. When I was in 10th grade I broke my leg and had to get around on crutches and It was diffcult because I had to leave class early which made me miss important class time, the elevator would not work sometimes making me have to risk going down the stairs, and the fatigue from getting around just made me tired and not want to learn. If I could have taken online classes I would have because I could just accomplish all the things I did at school but from the comfort of my home. If all students had this option schools would see an increase in grades, attendence, and graduation rate. Taking online classes makes students feel more safe and sometimes way happier. Although students could make friends at school and learn real life social skills, they also might get bullied and become more shy.

Students are being more and more stressed as they increase in grade level, and If schools can do anything to take away some of the stress they should. Taking online classes has almost no negitives and so many more positives. Schools should be more inclined to make more classes available online which leads to schools being more efficent in teaching. Tell your school to make more classes available online!              ",0
"The debate over whether school hours should be reduced from a full to a half day has been a long-standing one. Supporters of reducing the school day argue that it could reduce student stress levels, give students more time to focus on household responsibilities, and create a more level playing field among different schools. 

On the other hand, opponents point out that reducing the school day could mean a reduction in the quality of education, potentially leading to lower test scores and a lack of preparedness for college. They argue that all students should be held to the same standard when it comes to their education. 

Ultimately, the decision about whether or not schools should reduce the end of the school day to half time needs to be made on a case-by-case basis. From one school to another, factors like educational quality, student stress levels, and household responsibilities need to be taken into consideration. It could be argued that, depending on the context, the benefits of reducing the school day might outweigh the potential drawbacks. 

Thus, while the decision of whether or not to reduce the school day is complex and merit careful consideration, it is not an issue that should be overlooked. With the right combination of factors, reducing the school day could be an effective solution that benefits both students and teachers alike.",1
"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College versus election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a high school student, I have been learning about the pros and cons of both systems and would like to share my thoughts with you.

Firstly, I believe that the Electoral College has its benefits. It ensures that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This system encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. Additionally, the Electoral College helps to prevent the tyranny of the majority, where a candidate could win the election solely based on the support of one large group of people.

However, I also understand the argument for election by popular vote. This system would ensure that the president is elected by the majority of the American people, rather than a select group of electors. This would give more power to the citizens and make the election more democratic. Moreover, it would eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the election without receiving the most votes, which has happened in the past.

In my opinion, the best solution would be to adopt a hybrid system that combines the benefits of both the Electoral College and popular vote. For example, each state could be allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, but the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide would be declared the winner. This would ensure that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, while also reflecting the will of the majority of the American people.

I understand that there are also counterarguments to my proposal. Some people argue that a popular vote system would lead to candidates focusing solely on densely populated areas, neglecting the needs of smaller states. However, I believe that this could be mitigated by implementing a system where candidates are required to campaign in a certain number of states, ensuring that they address the concerns of voters across the country.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College and popular vote systems both have their strengths and weaknesses. A hybrid system that combines the benefits of both would be the best solution, ensuring that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states while also reflecting the will of the majority of the American people. I urge you to consider this proposal and work towards creating a more democratic and fair election system for the United States.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Character Traits: The Choice is Yours

Character traits are the personality characteristics that define an individual. They are the qualities that make a person unique and shape their behavior and interactions with others. But are these traits something that we choose for ourselves, or are they influenced by external factors? In this essay, I will explore the role of choice and influence in shaping our character traits and the consequences of each choice.

On one hand, it is possible that we have complete control over our character traits. We can choose to be kind, honest, and hardworking, just as we can choose to be mean, dishonest, and lazy. However, this viewpoint does not take into account the many external factors that can shape our personalities. For example, our upbringing, environment, and social interactions can all play a significant role in shaping our character traits.

For instance, if a person is raised in a loving and supportive environment, they are more likely to develop positive character traits such as empathy and compassion. On the other hand, if a person is raised in a toxic environment, they may develop negative character traits such as aggression and hostility. Similarly, our social interactions can also shape our character traits. The people we surround ourselves with can influence our behavior and attitudes, and can help to mold us into the person we become.

On the other hand, it can also be argued that our character traits are largely influenced by external factors beyond our control. Our genes, for example, can play a significant role in shaping our personality. Research has shown that certain personality traits, such as extroversion and introversion, are heritable and can be influenced by genetics. Additionally, our environment and upbringing can also have a significant impact on our character traits, even if we have no control over them.

The consequences of each choice in shaping our character traits can also be significant. If we choose to develop positive character traits such as kindness and empathy, we are more likely to have positive relationships and experiences in life. On the other hand, if we choose to develop negative character traits such as aggression and hostility, we may struggle to form and maintain healthy relationships and may face negative consequences such as social",1
"Dear Principal,

I am a student of your school, and i am against the rules of the grade requirement.

Most of the students in the school have a C grade average, so it takes away from them, and C is passing, so I believe they should be allowed to participate still as long as they have a C average.

Many kids are very good at sports and activities and all of them aren't always smart, and they might not be able to live life out how they could be so successful. School is a big part of life, but it is not always everything, grades should not be centered around sports, I believe. Pro athletes do not have to have a B average, so why would kids have to do school things to be able to do sports?

Some kids with disabilities, they might be really good at sports or other activities after school, and they might not get the B average, are we going say no to people that can really be successful in life at those skills, just because they didn't have the best grades in school? That would be ruining a kid's life, as he grows up, and he could of really been something in those activities, but his grade messed him up, and maybe he really tried his best.

I think we should change the rule, and give people the right to do the activities. Grades are supposed to be up, but not everyone is smart enough, and they try, but maybe they just can't get it. So I believe that the grade requirement should not be that high, or have one at all.

Your student,

"Imagine, you are a student stuck doing a required assignment you truly dislike;summer break is almost over and you don't have the motivation to complete it because schoolwork feels like a chore. The information your teacher discussed in class left as soon as the last bell rang in June, so you're also clueless. You might shrug it off until the last moment or just not do it at all.

To avoid this dilemma, schools that require students to complete Summer assignments should give students the freedom to design the project themselves. If students are truly passionate about their work, they would be more likely to complete the assignment. This way students maintain the information they obtained in class and have an outlet to express their creative side. This may also benefit students who cannot learn in a classroom setting due to severe anxiety or other mental illnesses and are confused for the next year. It can be hard reteaching yourself something but not if you put your heart into it and design a project to fit your academic needs.

Teacher's may argue that students will choose an easier route and not challenge themselves. They will also argue they worry that the students wont be creative. To avoid this teachers should create a rubric that the students must follow. This allows the teacher to grade the project on effort, creativity and neatness but also allowing the student to do what they please with the assignment. They may also fear that students might be inappropriate with their designs. However, teachers can discipline them by reporting them or writing them up.

Education is important and Summer projects can be tough. Especially if you're in no school mode already. If students are able to design their own projects they can reteach themselves what they might have forgot over Summer break. Not everyone learns the same so this would give students an opportunity to expand their minds. ",0
"One Monday morning, I saw my friend Generic_Name drenched in rain and with a troubled expression on his face. He told me he biked to school everyday and the weather was not kind to him today. I asked why he did not ask his parents for a ride to school, and he responded that both his parents need their cars for work. There was not a program to help him in the school and so he continued to use his bike in rain, snow, or shine. Although some may disagree, distance learning is beneficial to students because it helps students with disabilities and students without means of transportation.

Distance learning helps students that are disabled that cannot go to school because of their disability. For example, my classmate Generic_Name, he cannot walk without assistance from another person. Although he learns and engages in the lesson, he spends a good portion of the day going to the class rather than participating in it. If Generic_Name had a way to receive his education through online or video conferencing he would not have to spend so much time going to class. Another example is my friend Generic_Name, he cannot go to school due to his disability and as a result is home schooled. His education is stunted, however, as his parents do not have the resources that schools do. He cannot garner the experiences of a normal teenager and must take what is given. Had Generic_Name had a form of online learning, he could have discussions with his fellow classmates and learn more than what he being limited to. Through video or online education, a person with disabilities can still be educated.

Distance learning also aids in education as it helps students with transportation issues. For example, my friend Generic_Name has to get up early in the morning to get to school. He has no transport to school because his father only has one car and needs it to get to work. Generic_Name walks to school and sometimes he doesn't make it on time causing him to get tardy. He cannot even participate in extracurricular activities because he has to get home. Had Generic_Name had video conferencing, he would not have to worry about being late to class or about spending the majority of his free time on school. Another example is my friend Generic_Name, his education depends if he has money for the train. The majority of the time he does, however, sometimes he does not and may be late to class by a substantial amount of time. His economic status halts him in achieving his goals of becoming an engineer. If Generic_Name could learn through online or video conferencing, it will allow him to never miss any of his classes and lifts the burden of money on him. Through online education, students can alleviate daily concerns of missing class and can join their classmates in receiving the same experience that they do.

Some may object and say that online or video conferencing corrodes student's social skills. While understandable, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that students who have these problems choose homeschooling as an alternative. If homeschooling is to be the alternative, students should be allowed to learn with their classmates through conferences so that they can still cultivate social skills. By forbidding these new ways of learning, people that are home schooled have a much harder time adjusting to the world. For instance, my cousin Generic_Name who is very shy around people. She was home schooled until middle school and was having a difficult time adjusting to her new environment. She finally became more confident later in the year as she made new friends.

Had she attended online discussions, she could have become more confident in speaking. Through discussions and conferences at home, students that learn at home can still get a resemblance of a social life at school.

Students that are less fortunate can finally achieve their dreams with these new tools. As the world gets more technical and digital, the institutions we call school must change as well. By accommodating more students, a well educated populace can bloom and become greater members of society. Many people in life do not get the same advantages, but we must take even small amounts of equity.             ",0
"I think seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because not all people have the same ideas and they can give them different advise because we all think different. Me personally I think this is really good because their were time where i just asked one person for advise and it did not go well and when i asked multiple people it went good and i have a lot of examples that have gone well and bad.

One time I needed help with something personal and I asked 4 of my good friend for advise and they all told me different things but I try to put everything they told me into one idea and try to do it and I did and it went really well and I think if I did not ask more than one person it would have gone well because of the other persons feelings.

Other time I needed help with my math homework and instead of asking multiple people for help i\I only asked for one persons help and I think that was not a great idea because not all people will get what your trying to figure out. I only asked one person for help so it did not go well because i should've asked other person to because everyone works differently and they can get different answers.

So I just think its good if you ask multiple people for help or advise people,who knows if there right or wrong or if its good or bad advise because from my experience its better for you to ask multiple people.",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that the city council should adopt a curfew for minors. The potential dangers that minors face if they are out late at night are numerous, and it is important to teach them right from wrong. As a personal example, I remember a time when I was out late at night with my friends, and we ended up getting into a fight with some older teenagers. If we had been home at a reasonable time, we would have been safe and out of harm's way.

In addition to the potential physical dangers, minors who are out late at night may also be exposed to negative influences such as drugs and alcohol. These substances can have a significant impact on a person's life, and it is important to protect minors from them as much as possible. A curfew can help to prevent minors from being exposed to these negative influences and can encourage them to make better choices.

Furthermore, curfews can also help to promote a sense of responsibility in minors. By setting a curfew, parents and guardians can teach their children the importance of being responsible and accountable for their actions. This can help to build character and prepare minors for the responsibilities that come with growing up.

To illustrate the importance of curfews, I will use an example from the news. In recent years, there have been several cases of young people being killed or injured while out late at night. These incidents highlight the potential dangers that minors face if they are not properly supervised or if they make poor choices. By adopting a curfew, the city council can help to protect minors from these dangers and promote a safer community for everyone.

In conclusion, I believe that the city council should adopt a curfew for minors. The potential dangers that minors face if they are out late at night are numerous, and it is important to teach them right from wrong. A curfew can help to prevent minors from being exposed to negative influences and can promote a sense of responsibility. By adopting a curfew, the city council can help to protect minors and promote a safer community for everyone.",1
"In recent years, the debate between home schooling versus attending a traditional school has become increasingly prevalent. Both methods of education have their own unique advantages, and choosing which one is right for your specific situation can be a difficult decision. So, what exactly are the benefits of home schooling when compared to traditional schooling?

One of the most obvious benefits of home schooling is customization. Parents who choose this option are able to tailor their children's curriculum to fit their individual needs and abilities. Home schooling allows parents to build a lesson plan that caters to not only their child's strengths, but also focuses on areas that their child needs help with. Additionally, home schooling allows parents to accommodate their children's unique interests and provide advanced instruction in topics of their interest. 

Another major benefit of home schooling is the freedom for learners to work at their own pace. While in traditional school classrooms, teachers are limited to an average set pace that does not cater to students with different learning styles. However, home schooling allows students to slow down and take their time in understanding a concept or to skip ahead if they already possess any prior knowledge. 

Finally, home schooling provides learners with a more flexible schedule and the option to structure learning around other activities. Home schooling gives students the freedom to decide when and where they want to work, making it easier for them to choose hands-on and out-of-the-classroom activities. 

Although both traditional school and home schooling have their advantages, those who opt for home schooling are able to take advantage of more individualized and flexible instruction. Home schooling allows learners the freedom to customize their own unique learning experience and create a more personalized educational setting.",1
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked you're asking me to write this essay! 😃 As an 8th grader, I know that balance is super important in life. Like, if you're always working hard and never taking a break, you'll burn out and be totally miserable. But if you're always chillin' and never doing anything productive, you'll get left behind and be a total slacker. 😅

So, let's talk about why balancing work and leisure activities is so important. First of all, it's important to have some time to relax and recharge. Like, if you're always working on a project or studying for a test, you'll get stressed out and your brain will turn to mush. You need to have some time to just chill and do stuff that you enjoy, like play video games or hang out with your friends. 😎

But it's not just about having fun, it's also about being productive. If you're always working on one thing, you'll never get anything else done. You need to have a balance between work and leisure activities, so you can be productive when you need to be, but also have time to relax and recharge. Like, if you're always working on a project, you won't have time to study for a test or do your homework. 🤦‍♀️

Now, let's talk about some examples of what can happen if you don't have a balance in your life. If you're always working and never taking a break, you'll get burnt out and feel like crap. You'll be tired all the time and won't be able to focus on anything. Like, I know some people who are always working on their businesses and never take a day off. They're always stressed out and never have any fun. 😔

On the other hand, if you're always chillin' and never doing anything productive, you'll fall behind and get left behind. Like, if you're always playing video games and never studying, you'll fail your classes and be stuck in the same spot forever.",1
i believe in policy 1 because its not fear how teacher could have there phones and we cant like its not fear what if something serious was happing at home what if your the only person your parents could count on and you disappoint because your teacher wont let you have them i agree with the policy but we don't have to use them during class time we can use them during lunch and when you like go to your elective for period 4 you can use it to make your little phone call to your mom or dad and tell them how school is going and ask them how work is and then just go to your 4 period class but i' am still on the whole teacher can use there phones but students cant teachers are not fear because that they cant use there phones and we cant are phones but every time i look at them there texting or either calling someone and i just think that its not fear like once my mom was calling me to telling me to pick up my little brother from school after school can my teacher caught me and told the principal and the he took my phone away but then when she was ready to use her phone she didn't say nothing and i said i' am going to tell the principal but guess what ?he didn't do nothing that was not fear and he always says that at all time teachers and students shouldn't have there phones out at all times but why will he take my phone away from my he could have me a warning.,0
"Self-reliance and making independent decisions are essential keys to personal growth. Individuals should strive to become self-sufficient and learn to make decisions on their own. For example, when making a major life decision such as buying a house, getting married, or dropping out of school, individuals should rely on themselves rather than asking for help or advice from someone else, as it allows for greater personal growth and self-efficacy. Asking for someone else's opinion when making a decision can sometimes be detrimental, since it allows for external influence, thus limiting an individual's independence and autonomy. Therefore, it is important to practice self-reliance and develop the capacity to make independent decisions in order to achieve personal growth.",1
"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are that there would be less pollution in the air and that communities would be set up different to make it easier to get to places without having to drive to these place you could just walk instead.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that there would be less pollution. Source 4 says, ""If the pattern persits and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" This shows that if you cut out some of your car usage there will be less carbon in the air. Which would lead to less pollution and a better living environment for everybody. Source 3 says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The person who said this was talking about the car free day that occurs in Colombia. Going just one day without your car can have an impact on the carbon emissions and help bring down the amount of air pollution in that area.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is new community set ups. Source 1 says, ""But it's basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This shows that the government is willing to set up the community in a different way to limit the amount of car usage on a daily basis. Which also makes your shopping trips more convinant because the stores you need or want to go to are walking distance from your house. Source 3 says, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. This explains how the city is being remodeled to help encourage people to start using their cars less and to be able to walk to many places instead of driving there by bringing these places closer to their houses.

There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are that there would be less pollution in the air and that communities would be set up different to make it easier to get to places without having to drive to these place you could just walk instead.

"A world of less pollution, less costly wages, reduced congestion on the roads, healthier ways to venture around, and less stress and danger. That would be a world with limiting car usage. May not seem like a rational idea but when you see all the good that could come out of the reduction of cars on the streets it could change your way of thinking.

A city in Germany by the name of Vauban, 70 percent of their families do not desire to have cars. Over half of the percentage of people had sold their cars just to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Those were the words of a women by the name of Heidrun Walter who is a mother of two and is also a media trainer she finds bicycles and sound of children running about is a much more tolerant tone then the sound of a motor rolling by. The enviromentalists from the Enviromental Protection Agency favors the idea of car reduction. They stand for cars being limited would reduce pollution and be more friendly the mother earth. From the reduction of cars on the roads the congestion percent soared down a plump number of 60 percent. That's truely a magnificent amount.

I strongly believe that limitng the car usage would reduce death rates, reduce smog, put people in less tense moods keeping them more happy, and lastly reduce moeny going to greenhouse gas wages. More places worldwide should limit relying so much on cars, to allow us to function in daily life without them.    ",0
" Dear Generic_Name,

It is an honor for me to respond to your statement about human individuality and I agree with your statement. Being yourself in a world can be challenging, but it is essential to achieve success and happiness.

Firstly, when you are alone in a new place, whether it's a city or a foreign country, it can be daunting. There are no family or friends to rely on, and you must be self-sufficient. However, this is an opportunity to grow and develop as a person. You can learn new skills, explore different cultures, and become more confident in yourself.

Secondly, being true to yourself is essential in all aspects of life. In the workplace, you can express your ideas and opinions without fear of judgment. In school, you can be yourself and show your true colors. Being yourself can also help you make more meaningful connections with others. When people see the real you, they are more likely to connect with you on a deeper level.

Thirdly, demonstrating your true self can lead to more opportunities and success. When you are confident in who you are, you are more likely to take risks and pursue your dreams. You will also be more attractive to others, both personally and professionally.

In conclusion, being yourself in a world can be challenging, but it is essential for personal growth and success. It is important to embrace your true self and be confident in who you are. This will help you achieve your goals and make meaningful connections with others. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts on this topic.

"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",0
"Community service is an incredibly important part of developing character in students. It provides them with the opportunity to learn valuable skills, to practice selflessness, and to help make the world a better place. 

First of all, students who perform community service learn important skills that they can take with them into the future. Serving their community gives them experience in cooperation, teamwork, and compassion. Additionally, they gain skills such as problem solving and communication, which can help them with further education and career paths. 

Additionally, community service encourages students to be selfless. It can serve as a reminder that no matter what their own individual needs, there is always a way to be helpful to those around them. When students focus on contributing to society, they can see that their actions have a direct impact on the world around them.

Finally, through community service, students can help make the world a better place. By helping out in their communities, they are taking a personal stance on creating a brighter future for the people around them. This can foster a sense of shared responsibility and a desire to be an active part of helping their community. 

In conclusion, students should be encouraged and required to perform community service. It can provide them with the skills and selflessness needed to be successful in the future, while at the same time creating a brighter world around them.",1
"Dear principal,

Community service is very important these days. We can help out the community a lot. You should require community service to all of the students. It doesn't have to be a lot but a reasonable amount, about 100 hours of community service is great. The reason that this should be required is because were not just helping the community were helping our world and it's future. If we pick up litter it keeps the Earth healthy. Children should be tutored if that person needs help in school because the students are our future. If the students do poorly then so will the future. The students in elementary school should do good in school as well as middle and high school. Students must do good in school to get into college and make a career or even get a job. Now a days it is very hard to get a job without a high school diploma. The United States was ranked 1st in school academics, we are now ranked in the 20's. The Earth needs to stay healthy because this is the only planet that has life. People should not take this for granite. One day the Earth will not be able to hold life any longer. This is very far away but it will happen. We should keep the Earth healthy so it will hold life longer. Life is an amazing thing so we shouldn't take this for granite. People need to do community service not to help the community but to help bigger things like life and Earth itself. Just by picking up a piece of trash and putting it in a recycling bin can help. The smallest things can help this Earth. Community service is a great thing to do not only can it help but it gives you something to do then just sit around and nothing. It may not be the funnest thing ever but we need to do this for ourselves and the Earth. We should have contests in the homerooms to see who can bring in the most plastics and put it in recycling. We should also come up with ideas that will be fun and community service at the same time. A lot of the students think this will help a lot. People are trying really hard but they can't always do it themselves. People need help to save this Earth. There are so many things to do then just tutor kids or clean up roads. We could plant gardens in front of the school, or on a nice day we could go around the school and pick up things like plastics or bottles. These are just a few ideas. We can't always do this by ourselves. We need a lot of help because the World is too big for one person. Not only are we helping children with homework and picking up trash on the sidewalk but were helping all the animals that can't do this. Once an animal is extinct then the food web or food chain gets all messed up and if that animal that ate that species or plant cant adapt then that animal will die and it will just go on and on and on until there are no animals left and then we won't have anything to eat because there will be no plants or animals to eat. This is why community service should be requires it may seem like a small portion and won't help but every small bag on the sidewalk that gets put in a recycling bin helps.

"The great philosopher, Waldo Emerson, once said “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow”. This statement is profound and true, as it acknowledges the importance of pushing ourselves further towards our greatest potential. In order to grow, we must be willing to go beyond our comfort zone and traverse unfamiliar territory in order to broaden our horizons and personal development.

For example, if I wished to become a professional software engineer, I would need to take on a variety of different tasks far beyond what I already know. Without continuing to learn and develop my knowledge and skills beyond what I am already comfortable with, I would not be able to progress in my career in any meaningful way. Taking on challenges in a specific area forces us to think critically, refining our existing skillset and learning new ones that will support our growth.

Emerson's statement also applies to our personal lives. Whether it’s in our hobbies, our relationships, or even our daily habits, if we keep doing the same thing over and over again, we won’t experience growth or improve our individual circumstances. We need to challenge ourselves to step up and take on something new and exciting that will encourage us to think outside the box. Trying something beyond our current capabilities will develop our confidence and skill, allowing us to develop and reach our potential. 

In summary, Waldo Emerson’s statement of “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow” is profound and true. To grow, we must be willing to step outside of our comfort zone and take on unfamiliar challenges. Whether it’s professionally or personally, by pushing our boundaries, we will be setting ourselves up for personal and professional betterment.",1
"As in the physical world, inertia carries ideas onward. No idea exists languidly or singularly. No idea is a simple utterance or a glance, lost to the world the moment their intention is blurred. No- ideas are sparks, and what spark doesn't greedily take the thin air into its lungs to then watch itself bloom into a mighty flame? Being of this nature, human progress rushes on through the constrains of time, thrust forward by the gusts of wind at its back. A step is taken, and it falls forward two more steps. As of late, progress has become more akin to lightning than to any breed of animal, striking with the full speed and power of all past ideas. Indeed, as many thing have, educational systems around the world have been profoundly struck. New initiatives and programs are constantly being implemented to better suit the new world order, as defined by sudden bursts of new technology. One of these widely considered ideas is the using of the aforementioned technological advancements to facilitate learning. Online classes and education via live stream as well as their positive effects can already been seen in numerous school systems. Better at preparing them for their rapidly changing world, virtual schooling and at-home education are a great good to education systems and should be implemented around the world because they help students become more disciplined and prepare them for college-style learning as well as real-world learning experiences.

In this time of lightening progress, discipline and patience are long forgotten virtues. Despite the increasing lack of these traits in the youth of today, the world continues to demand them. It's simple economics, the law of supply and demand- all one needs to do is simply increase the supply. A manageable way of doing this is to give students greater opportunity to learn for themselves, which, in essence, is online schooling. Two years ago, entirely unprompted by my formal, in-building schooling, I decided to attempt to teach myself Japanese. Today, I look towards my future, seeing my first Japanese aptitude test successfully completed and an immersion trip to Japan embarked upon. Teaching myself Japanese based off of online resources has not only fueled my love of languages and urged me to begin new language adventures, such as studying Mandarin, Korean, and Ancient Greek, but has also convinced me of my ability to do whatever I have set my mind to in a way nothing else has. I have seen both my mind and confidence expand outward in new ways ever since I began my studies, and that has enriched my life in an incredibly impactful way. Similarly, online schooling and partial self-education could give countless students that same pride in their abilities and dedication to their studies that it gave me. When told that only one place will serve as their primary source of learning and then associating that place with the direct, critical judgment of others on their skills, students, ironically, don't learn much other than to doubt both themselves and the system that supposedly embodies study. If instead those same students were to be given the same information but driven to seek out more knowledge for themselves and schedule their everyday life around learning, life would become an enthralling adventure to prove one's worth to themselves and to investigate and marvel at the expansive body of knowledge surrounding one everywhere.

In addition to enriching their current lives, online education and the independence and initiative that comes with it prepares students much more thoroughly for higher learning experiences than any in-building experience could. A fundamental tenet of college and pursuits beyond it is a philosophy that partial self-education inherently breeds- learning is not about being fed a prescribed diet of knowledge, but rather seeing depth in all the ornate structures that make up the world. Schools employ countless lackluster brands of methodology to try to better ready students for college, such as the SATs, AP classes, and general preparedness lectures, but what can really prepare one better than diving into the closest thing to the actual situation themselves? By introducing students to this kind of learning, online schooling, on the students' end, helps to both de-stress students about college and get them invested in their own education. Many claim to know complex answers concerning the root of today's educational crisis, but there really is one easy fix- make students care about what they're doing and feel comfortable with it, and more students will find success and contentment in adult life. Ironically, the education system's primary function (to ready students for college learning) can really only be accomplished well with online schooling, a method many systems have yet to apply.

While in-building schooling fails to do this by turning school, and by extension, learning, into a chore and cracking down on spoon-feeding students information which they spit back out and are then evaluated on, online schooling opens students' eyes to the idea that knowledge is a living, breathing force that surrounds everything and, while incorporating elements of grading and standardization, shifts the focus more onto individual students testing their limits and discovering their abilities fro themselves. The world is changing, and in our lifetime, we will watch it morph countless times right before our eyes. For the sake of knowledge, for the sake of confidence, for the sake of virtue, and for the sake of the younger generation, who, if we can evolve the system in time, will go into the future prepared and enthused, online schooling and at-home education must be implemented on a much wider scale. After all, who else but our children will keep the fire of progress burning?",0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on how to attain self-esteem as an average 8th grade student:

Self-esteem is like a puzzle, and we're all trying to find the right pieces to make it complete. It's hard to feel good about yourself when you're always comparing yourself to others or feeling like you're not good enough. But there are things we can do to build our self-esteem and feel better about ourselves.

First, it's important to respect yourself. That means treating yourself with kindness and compassion, even when you make mistakes or don't do as well as you want to. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we have to be perfect, but nobody is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, and that's okay. It's how we learn and grow.

Another important thing is to put in effort. When we try our best and put in effort, we feel good about ourselves because we know we're doing something worthwhile. It doesn't matter if we don't get the outcome we want right away. What matters is that we're trying. And when we do get the outcome we want, it feels even better because we know we worked hard for it.

Behavior is also a big factor in our self-esteem. When we act with kindness and empathy towards others, we feel good about ourselves because we know we're making a positive impact on the world. And when we treat others with kindness and respect, they're more likely to treat us the same way. It's a cycle of positivity that can help us build our self-esteem.

Finally, education can play a big role in our self-esteem. When we learn new things and expand our knowledge, we feel good about ourselves because we know we're growing and improving. It doesn't matter if we're good at something or not – what matters is that we're trying. And when we get good grades or do well in a class, it's a great feeling because we know we've worked hard for it.

In conclusion, self-esteem is something we can build by respecting ourselves, putting in effort, behaving well, and educating ourselves.",1
"Resilience is like a superpower that we all have inside of us. It's the ability to keep going, to keep pushing forward, even when things get tough. And trust me, things get tough. Like, really tough. But the thing is, if we don't give up, if we keep striving for our goals, we can achieve anything we set our minds to.

I know, because I've been there. Like, so many times. I've faced obstacles and setbacks that seemed insurmountable, but I didn't give up. And you know what? I reached my goals. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it.

Take, for example, the time I wanted to join the school soccer team. I had always loved soccer, but I was never really good at it. Like, really bad. But I wanted to try out so badly, so I practiced every day. And I mean, every day. I would come home from school and go straight to the park to practice my shots and runs. And it was hard. Really hard. But I didn't give up. And guess what? I made the team!

But it's not just about achieving our goals, it's about the person we become in the process. When we strive for something, we learn to persevere, to push through the hard times, and to never give up. And that's a skill that will serve us well in life, no matter what we do.

Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment."" And I think that's so true. Life is full of ups and downs, and we have to be willing to take risks and try new things. Because if we don't, we'll never know what we're capable of.

So, don't be afraid to take risks, to strive for your goals, even when things get tough. Because the truth is, the tough times are worth it. And who knows, you might just achieve something amazing.

In conclusion, resilience is a superpower that we all have, and it's the key to achieving our goals. So",1
"The Electoral College, good or bad? Many may feel that the Electoral College has more downs than ups, but thats not always the case. I feel that despite these common views we should keep the electoral college due to the fact that popular vote may not always be the best way.

There have been multiple instances in which the electoral college has saved many elections due to the fact that the popular vote was too close. This ""college"" consists of multiple slates of electors. These electors are really who we vote for when we vote for president. Every 'state' including the District of Columbia are allocated a certain amount of electors. These electors then vote for whoever won the popular vote in that state despite the other sides views. This is called a ""winner-take-all"" system. Yet there are two states, Maine and Nebraska, that have a ""proportional representation"" system. When it is done the governor creates a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which basically is the official way of declaring who in that state won the vote.

The Electoral College is more good then bad due to the fact that it has saved instances of a tight vote. The Electoral College does require the presidential candidates to abide by some rules. One of which is making the candidate focus on other areas rather than the region they know they will win the vote in. Another like i have been talking about is the outcome, it enables a balance that should be kept between the popular votes. It is also another way like the two houses of Congress; where it keeps the balance of political choice between big states and small states. It also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

Now many may find it that the electoral college are beings from a bottomless pit because of the year 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush; with Al Gore winning with over 60% of the popular vote. This is most likely due to the reason why he mmay have stretched out all of his visits between the states. He may have won more popular votes in total than Bush but he may have appealed to a minority of people in each state so the overall of the state wanted Bush. Some say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor. Just because some may choose not to vote for the person they are supposed to doesnt mean that the entire college is bad. These things are going to heppen with people who think differently. Just because someone may think McDonald's is nasty and they refuse to go; are you going to not go because they don't? This happens in everything we do we are only human, we are different, not everyone thinks in the same way. When we do it is a recipe for disaster.

So, in my opinion, we must keep the electoral college if we want to keep the balance in everything the US stands for, politically and demographically. These are facts that should not be ignored, just because some see differently doesn't mean we have to change the foundation of our society.    ",0
"Aren't you tired of the accidents that happens frequently on the road, getting stuck in traffic and not getting to work on time or any important event that you must attend, and also the air being polluted by the gas cause by the car that gets us sick? Do you think it would be a good idea if we limit the usage of the car?. When you limit car usage it makes the world safer, it save time and less injury will occur.

When the car usage is limited it save time. When more people are walking on foot or riding bicycle its less chance of traffic in the streets and people can get to where they are going much faster. More cars on the road means more traffic, more waiting and a much higher percentage of people  loosing their  jobs because of constantly being late for work. It is also beneficial because you dont have to keep buying gas to put in your car and you have to remember that the bigger your vehicle is, is the more gas it use. Dont you prefer saving your money to do other important things than worrying about paying insurance and buying gas? In my perspective i think it would work out great.

Air pollution is one of the biggest problem now not only in the United States but all around the world . The cars that are used on the road is what contributes to the pollution because the fuel from the car is what helps to pollute the air and pollution is what cause people to get sick. Based on the article cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. It also stated that Diesel was blamed for these actions since diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in countries like France and 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. In this case the less car usage the better it is for our health and the better it is also for our environment.

When the car usage increase is the more accident that will occur on the road. Alot of people now a days are very reckless and care free when it comes on to driving on the road especially teenagers. Teenagers are known for getting into alot more accidents than any other people mainly because they are the ones that party alot and are not cautious when it comes on to drugs and alchol. When the car usage is limited is the less accidents that will happen and it will be safer for people. Occurding to Mr. Sivak when he was growing up he was curious about the kind of car people drove, but young people don't really care. A car to them just means getting from point A to point B.

Others may argue that having a car is much easier and faster to carry you to your destination than walking, riding a bicycle or using public transportation. Evening though this may be true cars are not safer than walking and riding a bicycle and it is also cause alot of accidents and to remind you it helps contribute to the pollution. As stated in the article with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habits. In other words the more people get use to walking and riding bicycles its going to harder for them to take up back the habit of having a car that takes them everywhere.

In conclusion when the car usage is limited its the less accidents that will occur. The better it is for your health because when you ride a bike or walk that is also exercising and exercising is good because it keeps your body fit and in shape and the less chance of people like elderly having muscle pains and nerve problems. It also help to save money, life and time and help people not to be lazy. In this case limiting car usage will help the world tremendously.                                                                                                                                                            ",0
"Have you ever been to Mars? Well neither have I and studies show that it is a great experience. There people who have different opinions about what is on Mars.

Some scientist say that on the planet Mars that there was a face created by aliens. Those people do no evidence which makes it hard to believe. They chose to believe what an magazine article, hollywood films, books, and radio talk shows knew what is was that they were talking about. They believe it ws a face from someone who had once been on Mars. They believe in multiple things but in fact do not have valuable information, or proven facts.

On the other hand, scientists think that the face was not brought by aliens but in fact just a rock formation. They fortunately do have more valuable facts and information. NASA has been able to prove that the face was indeed not brought from aliens but, ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."" They have porven that it is just a natural landform. How? Taken from the text it says,"" the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" - whcih are landforms common around the American West.

In conclusion, it has yet to be proven by actual authorities the scientists are still not sure about whther it is a face created by aliens or a natural landform. But there ar indeed facts that shows that it was not created by aliens but a natural landform but surely the other scientists will not give up on what they believe to have been created by aliens. There are still people who have different opinions based on things on this earth.       ",0
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on the consequences of students using cell phones in school. 📱📚

So, like, cell phones are super useful for stuff like checking the time, sending texts, and looking up stuff on the internet. But, you know, they can also be really distracting in class. Like, if someone's phone goes off during a lesson, it can be really hard to focus after that. And, like, if you're supposed to be taking a test, but you're busy scrolling through Instagram, you're gonna do really bad on the test. 🤦‍♀️

And, like, it's not just distractions. Cell phones can also be used for stuff that's not, like, totally cool. Like, if someone's sending mean messages to someone else, or if they're looking at inappropriate stuff, it can be really messed up. And, like, schools have to deal with that stuff, too. 😔

But, you know, cell phones can also be really helpful for learning. Like, you can look up stuff on the internet that's related to what you're learning in class. Or, like, you can use apps that help you study and stuff. 📚💡

So, like, I think schools should let us use our phones for learning stuff, but not for non-educational stuff. Like, no scrolling through Instagram during class, but you can use it to look up stuff for a project or something. 🤔

I don't know, what do you think, Mrs. Johnson? 😅

Oh, and I hope this essay isn't too messy! I'm still learning how to write essays, so bear with me! 😅",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that allowing phones in classrooms for educational purposes has both pros and cons. While some argue that phones can enhance student learning, I believe that they can have a negative impact on student learning. In this essay, I will argue why students should not have phones in classrooms by providing evidence for each of the points I make.

Firstly, allowing phones in classrooms can be a distraction to students. Studies have shown that students who use their phones in class are more likely to miss important information and struggle to concentrate. This is because phones are designed to be engaging and addictive, and students may find themselves scrolling through social media or playing games instead of paying attention to their teacher.

Secondly, phones can also be a source of cheating. With the internet readily available on phones, students may be tempted to cheat on exams or assignments by searching for answers online. This not only undermines the value of education but also teaches students that it is acceptable to cheat.

Thirdly, phones can also be a distraction to other students. If one student is using their phone, it can be difficult for their classmates to focus on the lesson. This can create a disruptive environment and make it harder for the teacher to teach.

Lastly, phones can also be a source of distraction to the teacher. If a student is using their phone, it can be difficult for the teacher to see what they are doing and whether they are following the rules. This can create a situation where the teacher feels like they are not in control of the classroom.

In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to allowing phones in classrooms for educational purposes, I believe that they can have a negative impact on student learning. Students who use their phones in class are more likely to miss important information, cheat, distract other students, and distract the teacher. As such, I believe that students should not have phones in classrooms.",1
"Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Venus is a planet in the solar system, it is the second planet from the sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin, Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetory neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in venus's atmosphere.

The difference in speed means that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. Because Venus is something right around the corner in the space terms human have sent numerous space craft to land on the cloud-draped world. No space craft survived the landing for more than hours. Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present earthquakes, amd frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface. Venus has the hotest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending human to study venus. NASA's posible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the frays. Srriving to meet our challenge presented by venus has a big value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human currosity will likely lead us into manequally.

"Hey, I'm so glad you're teaching us about the importance of having a positive attitude! I mean, let's be real, it's like, super important for success in life. Like, think about it, if you have a positive attitude, you're way more likely to achieve your goals and be happy, right? But if you have a negative attitude, you're gonna struggle and stuff.

So, I did some research and found out that people who have a positive attitude are way more successful in life. Like, they're more likely to get promoted at work, make more money, and have better relationships. And it's not just about being happy all the time, it's about being secure in yourself and your abilities. When you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to take risks and try new things, which can lead to great opportunities.

On the other hand, people who don't have a positive attitude are way more likely to struggle in life. They're more likely to get stressed out and anxious, which can lead to serious mental health problems. And they're also more likely to give up easily when things get tough, which can hold them back from reaching their full potential.

I mean, think about it, like, if you're always thinking negative thoughts and stuff, you're gonna attract negative things into your life. But if you're positive and optimistic, you're gonna attract good things! It's like, the law of attraction or something.

And let's not forget about life challenges. Like, when things get tough, you can either let it get you down or you can use it as an opportunity to grow and learn. When you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to see challenges as opportunities, which can help you become a stronger and better person.

So, yeah, I think it's pretty clear that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Like, it's not just about being happy all the time, it's about being secure in yourself and your abilities, and being open to new opportunities. And if you don't think it's important, well, you're just gonna be missing out on a lot of great things in life.",1
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying ,""Venus is Earth's twin and closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". In the article it says that Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun and because of that the tempetures in Venus are way different than Earth's tempetures.

But some people or scientist actually belived theres life in venus just like earth but alot different because in the article it says,"" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varios forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth for example theres surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Even people think that Venus is probably our nearest option for a planetary visit just like in the article it says,"" The National Aeronautics (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"". NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Since Venus is the second closest planet to the sun the tempetures are really hot, compared to Earth's tempetures. Its so hot the tempetures in Venus are like 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth.

But Earth and Venus are two planets that probably had same features along time ago and that we all know theres alot to discovered in our solar system and thats what i think the author was trying to support. And mybe it might happen in the near feuture and discovered more about Venus but for right now only time will tell.   ",0
"""When you vote what do you commonly feel? Do you feel as joyful that your making a difference in the country as an elephant in its prime leading the herd?

"Should people be texting and driving?

Even though people this they can do it without an accident, people should not be using a phone while driving. Teens, being the main group of people driving distracted, including the fact that the majority of they are newly trained drivers could cause more damage than just a crash. In 2017, over 3000 people were killed due to drivers being distracted. Some things aren't worth the risk and can just be pushed off to another time. While driving and using the device you are putting other drivers, passengers, bystanders and even yourself at risk of getting hurt or much worse.

In any case, while you are texting and driving, you are not thinking about anyone else other than yourself. The main thing going through a person's head while on their phone is what's happening on the screen. You readers may have, or know someone who could be looking at their phone and not hear a word someone says. It's already disrespectful to be on your phone while talking to somebody, so imagine how crazy it is to be on it while operating dangerous vehicle at high speeds. Texting and driving is more of an impulse, the driver is more worried about getting caught than hurt ,but the punishment of death and homicide is worse than texting and driving.

Without a doubt, you may think that the person you are texting or the game that you are playing can be done at another time. The game can wait till you are out of the car, but if you need to communicate with someone, there are many alternatives than doing it while driving. You have option to call someone and put your phone on spreaker so it will be out of your way, pulling over into a parking lot is also a choice and finally texting at a red light or stop sign only if its legal in your state. Like the famous quote from Star Trek, The

Wrath of Khan, ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" meaning that you have to put the majority over yourself even if you think you shouldn't.

Although, you may not want to die, there are still more simple reasons you should avoid using your phone while driving. If you get caught you will have to pay an expensive fine and your car insurance will go up. Paying hundreds of dollars is not worth one text, one youtube video of anything else you could be doing on it. Most of the people who text and drive probably is doing it because they will be busy later, but going to court for a ticket will just add more to your schedule.

As a result, you as a reader can see all the risks and should yourself

""is this really worth it""? In a situation like this, the cons outweigh the pros and that's not good. If you want others to care about you then you have to respect yourself first to show them what it looks like. Think about the family of the kid you ran over all to heart some instagram post, it's not worth it. If you truly want to be a responsible driver, then obey the laws and don't use your phone while driving.

" It is often said that having a positive attitude is the key to a fulfilling life, but others argue that it is not always the case. While it is true that maintaining a positive outlook can help us navigate through difficult times, it is not always possible to maintain a positive attitude in every situation. In fact, sometimes negative emotions such as sadness, anger, and fear can be a natural response to certain events, and trying to force oneself to be positive in these situations can actually make things worse.

For example, when someone close to us passes away, it is not always possible to maintain a positive attitude, especially in the immediate aftermath of the loss. It is important to allow ourselves to feel our emotions and grieve in a healthy way, rather than trying to force ourselves to be positive. Similarly, when we experience heartbreak or other forms of rejection, it is not always possible to maintain a positive attitude, especially in the early stages of the healing process. It is important to give ourselves time and space to process our emotions and heal, rather than trying to force ourselves to be positive.

Moreover, it is important to recognize that not everyone has the luxury of being able to maintain a positive attitude all the time. Life is full of unexpected events and challenges, and sometimes these events can be overwhelming and difficult to cope with. In these situations, it is important to be kind to ourselves and allow ourselves to feel our emotions, rather than trying to force ourselves to be positive.

In conclusion, while having a positive attitude can be helpful in many situations, it is not always the key to a fulfilling life. It is important to recognize that negative emotions are a natural response to certain events, and that it is okay to allow ourselves to feel these emotions rather than trying to force ourselves to be positive. Ultimately, the key to a fulfilling life is to be kind to ourselves, allow ourselves to feel our emotions, and give ourselves the space and time to heal and grow.",1
"On May 24, 2001, NASA found something funny on Mars. The Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photos of possible landings sites for Viking 2. During that time, it spotted something that appeared to be an enormous head. It looked like an Egyptian pharoah, but turned out to be a regular, old mesa. It is still debated whether it was created by ancient Martian life, or whether is was just another regular landform on Mars.

My fellow co-workers and I thought this was incredible. We had just found something that could have proven ancient life on Mars. It turned out that it wasn't. Later, we figured out that it was another regular Martian mesa. We were so excited when we thought we had just found proof of earlier life on Mars. We thought we had just made one of the greatest scientific discoveries there has ever been. We were joyful when we saw the Face. We thought we found proof of ancient alien life without even looking for it.

Some people think that the mesa was actually created by aliens. In paragraph 5, it says that people thought NASA was just trying to hide all of the information. To be honest, we were hoping it was proof of alien life. We wanted to find proof of alien life. Why would we hide that information? That just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

The Face is just a landform. In paragraph 2, it says that Marian mesas were common in the area the Face was in, Cydonia. Also, the shadows were the only things that made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. All that says is that a landform could be lucky and have some features that amde it resemble someone. Plus, how would Martians know what a Pharaoh looks like? They would be from Mars and not Earth. They most likely don't know anyone that even looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information? I'll leave you to decide that.   ",0
"Dear school principal,

I do not think that kids should do community service because they could have other school activity's to do like band or sports. If its during the day then it is fine but when it is after school kids should hang out with there friends and do sports then do community service. If they wanted to or there mad them then that is fine but if you make them then they should not have to do it. What happens if they have travel softball, soccer or volleyball. If it is during the school day then yes but is they are doing any sports they should not have to do community service. I mean some kids might like reading to other kids like first or second graders but if they are in the middle school or in the high school they should not be doing community service. Some reasons they should not do community service is that they have jobs, they have sports to do or they want to hand out with there friends. In my opinion i so not think kids should do community service.",0
"Online classrooms through video conferencing will not help students. Only truly dedicated students will actually use this and learn from this and even then they are missing out on the social experience that comes from other students and teachers, when learning at a physical school.

The people who will use this and succeed properly are a very minuscule amount. Kids who are taking solely online courses will not pay very much attention to there instructor, and they will find easy ways to cheat on exams and tests; they can look things up on the internet with there computer or phone, or have there notes sitting right there while taken the tests. Only a very small amount of people will actually learn and retain what they have learned by means of online classes especially at the middle school and high school levels.

If kids are taking solely online courses they will miss out on so many things they could experience by going to a regular school. They will miss the human connection between the teacher and student, and student to student connections and interactions. They will miss the opportunity to make mistakes and being able to learn and prepare for them better. Home school kids tend to be more introverted and not very good with interacting with people. Going to a physical school and having day to day human interactions helps you just as much if not more for the real world as does learning a subject. If we change to online classes kids in the future will not be well prepared to deal with problems regarding two or more people they may be working with. Online schooling will turn us into introverted machines, rather then regular human beings that have the chance learn, grow and interact with others.

Someone may say you can prevent cheating on tests and quizzes by having a camera on while taking them. I would say to that, no one likes having big brother watching them do things constantly let alone taking an important test without having every action you do read to determine if you're cheating or not. They may say that it gives kids more time in the day to things and takes stress off of them. I would agree but then again, you need to be stressed once in a while in order to understand from it and help you become better. I would say the majority of kids have plenty of free time now; considering sports and extra curricular activities are down in the country. Kids just waste there free time.

Taking the social element out of school and putting school online and in the home away from people, is the worst thing that can be done. We already have a whole generation who can't deal with there problems because they grew up in a box; it would only make things worse when you completely take out the human element in school and taking away the chance for kids to have relationships, make mistakes and figure out those mistakes on their own. This will allow them to grow and become a better person socially and academically. ",0
"Imagine yourself in a driverless convertible. You think you have no worries and everything is perfect. The wind is running through your hair and you reach down to grab a pair of sunglasses. Then all of a sudden your in a nasty road rage of cars and you crash. But how? Driverless cars are supposed to be safe. In reality, so many things can go wrong and malfunction. Who would be responsible in paying the hospital bills and car charges? The makers of the cars or the person in the drivers seat?

Not only can we not trust the cars but we can not trust us humans. As said in paragraph 8, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? ""

Everybody is different and will react differently or not react at all to the signals letting us know when it is our turn to drive. What happens if we get so bored we fall asleep and wakeup in a crash? Even if there are rules and regulations to the driverless cars we are all not guarenteed to follow them. Until there is more signals that will help every indivudual , no one should be driving driverless cars.

What happens if a car malfunctions? You can not always trust the makers of the cars. Malfunctions and recalls can be rare but happen often. Cars are not always coded properly. What happens if the engineering code messes up and drives you somwhere else or into a ditch? There should be more saftey precautions other then the airbags and seat belts .These things are always bound to happen so we should always be prepared when it comes to new inventions.

Who is responsible in paying for the damage that happens? As said in paragraph 9, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufacturer?

If the companies thought smarter they would know it is not a good idea to have driverless cars. Not only are you saving time but you are saving money. There would be so many court cases on who is paying for hospital funds and that would cost a lot of many for the companies, that some may not be able to afford.

Overall, there should not be any driverless cars and they should make it illegal in all states. Driverless cars are not safe, due to malfuctions , and the irrespossibility of us careless humans. Unless there is more testing and helpful signals to keep all individuals safe there should be no driverless cars.",0
"Taking an art class can be incredibly beneficial for a variety of reasons, but one of the most important is the potential to make money. Whether you are a budding artist or just looking for a new hobby, taking an art class can help you develop valuable skills that can be applied in a variety of ways.

One of the most common ways that people use their art skills to make money is through selling their work. Whether it's through online marketplaces like Etsy or in-person at local art fairs, selling your artwork can be a lucrative way to earn money. However, it's important to note that this can be a competitive field, and it may take some time to build up a customer base and establish a reputation.

Another way that people use their art skills to make money is through freelancing. This can involve creating art for websites, logos, or other marketing materials, or even working as a graphic designer. Freelancing can be a flexible way to earn money, as you can work on your own schedule and take on as many or as few projects as you like.

In addition to these more traditional methods, there are also a variety of other ways that people use their art skills to make money. For example, some people use their art to teach classes or workshops, while others may use their skills to create custom products or even design clothing or accessories.

Regardless of the specific way that you choose to use your art skills to make money, it's important to remember that it takes time and practice to develop the skills and knowledge needed to be successful. However, with dedication and hard work, taking an art class can be a valuable investment that can lead to a variety of financial opportunities.

In college, many students choose to take art classes as part of their general education requirements. However, many also choose to pursue art as a major or minor, and there are a variety of ways that this can lead to financial success. For example, some students may choose to pursue a career in the arts, such as becoming a painter, sculptor, or graphic designer. Others may choose to use their art skills to pursue a career in a related field, such as advertising or marketing.

Overall, taking an art class can be a valuable investment that can lead to a variety of financial opportunities. Whether you choose to sell your work, freelance, or",1
"The principal decided that all students must participate in at leas one extracurricclar activity. In the other hand i strongly disagree with this decision. Some people mait want to acshuly do a extracurricular activity and thats find. Is wen the make othe people that dont want to do it , that wea i disagree.

For exampol, students can do sports. What about if they dont have the money beacus mous esports you have to but things like soccer for soccer you need soccer cleats, Or they jues dont have the healp beacau they mait be fat of someting eals so the dont have the capasati of being abol of plaing a sport. In many caises they jues dont fell like play a spor expesioly if they arent geting nthing out of it.

to do a extracurricular actirity you need time. But what about if you dont have time. But what about if you can do that extracurricular activity beacus you have to go home to cean the haues. Or you jues can stay afthe school beacus you have to do stufe home or thers a amergai. But one of the mous importan tings is homwork if you n a spor time you can do your homework beacus you are going to get home lait at night unless you stay up all nigth doing it. Or what about if you have to stady for a importan teast that you have the next day.

I know many people mait wnt to paly sports and healp with the year book and that find. But its not find wen they are maiking us do some ting tha we mait nasesary want to do. So thats why i disagree with the principal and tank that not evry estudent need to do a extracurricclar activity. And that why i diagree and you shud to. ",0
"Hey there! 

So, like, I know it's super important to value yourself and have someone to look up to, right?  Like, it's basically a thing that'll help you, like, find your way in life and stuff.

And having someone to look up to is, like, totally crucial too.  It's like, someone who's gonna be there for you and support you, even when things don't go as expected.  Like, when things get tough, you can be like, ""Hey, I messed up. Can you help me?"" And they'll be like, ""Of course, we're in this together!"" 

But, like, sometimes things don't go as expected, right?  Like, maybe you'll work hard and study for a test, but you still don't do as well as you wanted to.  Or maybe you'll ask for help, but the person you ask doesn't understand what you need.

"Their are people that think the fece on mars was actually made by aleins. They athink that it is a alein artifact. There are beliefs that is like the Pharaoh of egypt, it is thought to prove life on mars. This is all false.

The only reason the formation look like a face is becuase of that shadows. The angle that they were at made shadows that looked like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The carma they were using at the time also wasnt that great. It was good for the time but it is not as accurate compared too more recent camras.

In the next few photos of the face of mars you can clearly see that it is just a rock formation and not a face. The face of mars was just a rock formatoin and some perfictley placed shadows. In the most recent picture of it you can see that it looks nothinhg like a face and just like a hill or big rock. Some people might say that NASA is just trying to hide the alain life but this is false.

If NASA really found life forms on a diffrent planet they would tell every body because they would make a lot of money. Every body would be interested in the new life forms and want to learn all about them. They would help found NASA to do research and do every thing they could to learn more. This meaning NASA would expaned a lot. It would get so much more income and job applications.

The the face of mars looks just like some of the natural land forms on earth. This is also just another way to prove that it is not a sign of alein life. The face of mars is just a normal landform that happened to have some very face like shadows apear when they were taking the picture.",0
"Hey there!  So, I've been tasked with writing an essay about the benefits of seeking professional guidance versus making my own decisions.  I'm like, totally stoked to be doing this, you know? 

First off, let's talk about the values and stuff that are most important to me.  Okay, so I value honesty, integrity, and kindness. Like, duh. Those are the basics, right? But I also value independence and self-reliance. I mean, I want to be able to take care of myself and make my own decisions without relying on others too much. It's like, important to me to be able to think for myself and not be a burden on anyone else. 

Now, let's get to the good stuff.  Researching the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance versus making my own decisions is like, totally fascinating.  See, when you seek professional guidance, you get the benefit of someone else's experience and expertise. They can help you make informed decisions and avoid making mistakes that could be, like, super costly or whatever.  But, on the other hand, making your own decisions can be super empowering. Like, you get to take control of your life and be in charge of your own destiny. It's like, totally liberating, you know? 

So, here's the thing.  I think it's important to make your own decisions because it helps you learn and grow as a person.  When you make your own decisions, you have to think critically and problem-solve. It's like, good for your brain and stuff. Plus, it helps you develop your own identity and sense of self. Like, you get to figure out who you are and what you want in life without relying on anyone else.  It's like, totally essential, you know?

"There is a new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"" that allows a computer system to read humans emotions by their expressions. This new advanced technology isn't valuable in a classroom enviroment. In a classroom it depends on the reason, and the student for this technology to be used. This system in a classroom can be taken advantage, and not used correctly.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" being used in a class isn't very valuable, unless a student is always sad, and not doing well in school. No one wants everyone knowing their personal issues. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" (by Nick D' Alto) it states "" The facial expresstions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (para 4). Dr. Huang is saying that there is several emotions, even though people show expressions very little or not very much. Explaing that not everyone shows too much emotion, because some people might be to their selves. But even if a person is more to their selves the system can still read you're emotions even if you aren't really showing any. In the article it explains how the software can recognize the expressions. In the article it states "" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's master piece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)"" (para 4). In this qoute it explains the process of the new technology ""Facial Action Coding"".

Some people won't want their expressions read by people they don't really know.

They also might not even want to talk about thier personal issues, because they just don't want to stress about it or because they don't want people judging them. This system can be taken advantage of for the wrong reasons in a classroom, and not be valuable. If this system is used in a class room it has to be for the correct reasons and not just because you think someone is always ""mad"" or ""sad"", and it might not always be the case. It has to be because you want to help a student, because they might be going through a rough patch in life and need someone to talk to. But if this new system is used to help someone, it should be in private; where no one is around.

In conclusion, the new technology "" Facial Action Coding System"" is not valuable in a classroom. This new system shouldn't be used by students/teachers unless they have a teachers permission and only for a reasonable case. It shouldn't be used a lot, specially in a class room full of students.",0
"When limiting the car uses to many of people it helps the world because of all the polution that the cars are letting out. The problem with that is its killing animals, trees and plants, and its messing with the global air.

"The author presents their own opinion on why we should investigate Venus for human civilization. In each paragraph that the author writes, they explain in detail the pros and cons about the study of Venus. Using the knowledge that they have of the planet, many of the ideas that they present give the idea that they are determined to give us the reason to agree with him.

The first idea that they auther states is that Earth, Venus, and Mars are all very close in terms of density and size, and is very close in orbit as well. This leads to Earth sending spacecrafts to land on Venus to gain research on the other planet, but each time, the spacecraft only has limited time to gain research because of the harsh conditions. This gives the author a way of explaining the details of Venus in a descriptive way. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds with highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than Earth.

Even with the highly hostile environment, the author explains why astronomers are still trying to visit the planet. The author explains how Venus may have been like Earth in terms of nature. Their detailing explains how Venus was possibly covered largely with oceans and had the same ability as Earth by being able to support forms of life. The author also states that when Venus is close to Earth's orbit, astronauts can easily fly to it's surface and land.

Throughout the essay, the author explains the difficulties and how we can get past inhabiting Venus. He describes in many ways how landing on the planet can be beneficial for research and living conditions. ",0
"Florida Senator-

I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appauled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitution-decades ago.  The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical.  I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential canidate, they are not.  Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president.  Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions?  Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives canidates different motives for their campaign.  I believe that in an electoral campaign, canidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting.  However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by canidates, as if they don't matter, so that the canidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from.  In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the canidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad.  If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded?  It makes sense for the canidates to see ""swing states""-the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another.  I don't blame the canidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.

The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting.  For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which canidate the state's electoral votes will be going to.  People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way.  The ""winner takes all"" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting.  Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, one-half of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not.  I'm sure that a good portion of non-voters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.

As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issues-issues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system.  Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place.  With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote.            ",0
"Need advice? People ask multiple people for their opinions because they may need more help, looking for a more mature idea or comparing the advice for a better idea of what they need.

People may ask for more advice because they need more help on decisions they are making or can't decide of what to do or say in the situation they are in. It all really depends on the situation and what they are going through to make the mature decision. Asking immature people isn't really a good idea in my opinion because they could get you in trouble or ending up not making the best decision. I think to make the best decisions is to ask advice from someone you trust and are really close to and they are mature enough to give you the best advice.

They may want to be the better person in the situation and be more mature and ask for more mature advice or thinking to seek a better decision, and a better choice depending on the situation they are going through or what they are deciding. I think that being the mature one and the better person is the best decision to make or do. If some people think that asking for multiple peoples advice is making them seem desperate or needy that is wrong because you need and should make the right choice for you..

People may compare advice given to them because they may like some of the advice they have been given so then they will combine some of it so they can make a good choice. Which I think is a good idea for people to use as long as they make a smart and good decision best for them. So, asking for multiple ideas and advice is a good thing to do because it gives you more help, you make a mature decision and you can compare and combine the advice and ideas you are given to make the better decision and it can make your life better in the end if you make a good and smart decision for you and your peers and you wont have any regrets... ",0
"I think that it is not an alien face because in the text it states "" There was no alien monument after all."". They used an digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, and because the text states that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or measa landforms common around the American West.""

The first reason why I say that it was not an alien head is because It was just a natural landform. That is because when the had the chance to take the picture they did and when it first appeared on a JPL web site showing that it wsa an natural landform, that it was nothing that you could now but not tell no one. Some people thought that it was still a alien head but had no proof abut it they had proof that it was an landform.

Another reason why I thnk it is an alien head is because they had digtial image 3 times bigger than te pixel size so if something was there they could see what it was, it was best Viking photo ever so they could not have said nothing. You could see almost anything out that picture even something small you could see it so there wa no way that it was an alien face.

Last reason why is becase when they got a look it was actually a ""butte or mesalandforms common around the American West nd it's as common to see around there. I was very hard work in order to do that anyway so if they were wrong why would they waste so much time doing this anyway. When they came back everyone was waiting and when they got the picture it was just an landform and they had so much proof about it to.

In conclusion everyone has there opinion and they believe what they want and sometimes people had proof about that they think is going on and that some people don't they just think that it looks like something that it is always going to be what you think it is. You have to have evidence to back up your thoughts or no one will believe you.",0
"Introduction:

As an eighth-grade student, I have always been fascinated by science and its potential to change the world. For my summer project, I have decided to research a famous scientist and conduct a science experiment related to their work. In this essay, I will identify the scientist I chose and the experiment I will conduct, as well as explain why I chose this project and how it may help me or others.

Scientist:

I have chosen to research Albert Einstein, one of the most famous scientists in history. Einstein is best known for his theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space and time. I chose Einstein because his work has had a significant impact on the world and his ideas continue to shape our understanding of the universe.

Experiment:

For my science experiment, I will conduct an experiment related to Einstein's theory of relativity. Specifically, I will test the idea that time passes slower for objects in motion. To do this, I will use a simple pendulum and measure the time it takes for it to complete one swing. I will then repeat the experiment with the pendulum in motion and compare the results.

Why I chose this project:

I chose this project because I am interested in science and want to learn more about the world around me. By conducting this experiment, I hope to gain a better understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity and how it applies to the world we live in. Additionally, I believe that this experiment has the potential to help others understand the concept of time dilation and its practical applications.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, I believe that conducting a science experiment related to a famous scientist is a great way to learn more about the world and its potential to change. By researching Albert Einstein and conducting an experiment related to his work, I hope to gain a better understanding of the world and its potential to shape our future.",1
"I agree because there might be some kids out there who say that they want shorter school time and maybe some don't want that but i think there should be shorter school time. The reason of that is because nowadays theirs youtube and most of the people have phones computers and TV's and so people can go learn stuff from phones,computers,and tv. And theres places that you can learn math too.

The reasons of why i think its fair for having shorter school time is because sometimes you learn something that you've learned already and in the other hand its just not fun anymore either i mean for some other kids they think its fun and some not. And also i've seen on twitter that they been hating on the guy who tells us if school is closed or not and people always hope that school is closed because no one is really looking foward to go to school on a monday and my opinion going to school on a monday is the worst and some other people might think the same as well.

Some celebreties became famouse for example Eminem who is a rapper he dropped out of highschool and he became famouse for something that he likes to do i would do the same if i didn't what to go to highschool but i wont because i have really good friends and all the years i've known them i just can't leave them like that.

I guess it just wont be fair y'know to leave someone you've known for awhile and just become famouse and while there in school working hard.

I guess we could all agree that we should have shorter school time because what if your doing something and you don't get to finish your project or something important you'll have to wait intill you get out of school and then come back and what if theres traffic and then you get home around 8:30 to 9:00. You wont have that much time to finish your project but if you live close to the school then i can't complain but i agree to this because like how i said we have phones,computers,and TV's and on the internet you could learn anything you want for an example you could learn about 10th grade stuff even though your an 8th grader maybe your interested in that.

My point here is that we should have shorter school time because nowadays we could learn by ourselfs and for the preschool kids and kindergarden kids they should stay there a little longer because they are toddlers and they can't learn anything by them selfs but for us we should i have shorter time in school hopefully you could understand. I don't want this to effect anyone but like it'll just make all the kids who go to school have more time when they have to do something important instead of coming home late and barely have anytime to finish there project or anything they need to do but thats my point of view.",0
"Everybody works when their kids, and when their adults. Kids work so hard in school, and rack up so much homework, it overflows them everyday when they get home. When you have so much work, and so little time to do things you love like spending time with your family the homework gets in the way of that. School takes over your life which is a good thing, and a bad thing. It can be a good thing because you learn so much which can help you excel in life, but it can take the life you should be living when your a kid. A kid should be able to play outside with friends, and go to the pool to swim but they can't.

Making a kid have to do more school work, and stay longer at school would just give them more stress. More stress would make a kid become overwhelmed, and not do as well as they used to with less stress. Adding a extra activity to a kids life would just take away the name kid, a kid should be with his/her family, or outside running around. Schools need to have extra actives for kids, but they should never force a kid to do them.

Don't make a kid work more and add more stress to their life you should be taking away the stress.

As a kid to much work just makes a kid not want to work. If you force a kid into adding an extra activity to their seclude it just ruins the childhood they should be having. A kid should make his/her own choices in which what they want to do as a kid. Kids need to have fun, and play around and be close with there family, but adding an activity is like adding a year to a prison sentence, you are stuck in some place you don't want to be at. I believe that all kids should get to chose either if they want to do the extra activities or if they don't. School is just one big heartbreaking place where kids have to sit around all day, and then go eat food which no one knows what it actually is.",0
"As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet. If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society.

It was mentioned in the passage on paragraph 6 that "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' ""

The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.

When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of ""In the real world"" and "" Highschool is preparing you for the real world"". Later on in life, ""in the real world"", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.

The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage.

The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.

I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.

People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show. Other people may bottle these feelings up in hopes that nobody will see. If people want to keep in how they feel, they should be able to do that as it is what they want.

Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.   ",0
"The use of face technology is not important to the people. The face on a painting is important but no one cares what the expression is on the face. students in a classroom are not aleays happy or mad they are mostly bord in classrooms sitting there. The claim of the article is that using face technology is a good thing or not.

So people might think it is a good thing and there are others that think it is not a good thing to use that. Why would anyone want to know if a thing or person is happy or not. He made a painting of a person that is one of everything in the painting. There would be people that want to know if a painting is happy or mad or sad. It is just a painting on a wall that you look at not think if it is happy.    ",0
"I think the Face On Mars is a natural landform because there are other landforms already like it on Earth, and there are other mesas like it around the Cydonia region. I think if aliens were on Mars I think we might have discovered them by now, but you can never be sure.

The Face is just formed by conveniently placed shadows. NASA wishes there was life on Mars becase they would benefit from it, so why would they try to cover up something that could get them a lot of popularity and money. Scientists researched this farther and released even better pictures proving it was just a landmass and not an alien artifact. People believe that the clouds could've covered up alien markings but that seems illogical because in 2001 they went back to the face and took more pictures with even higher resolution and found that there were no markings at all, meaning more evidence leaning towards the Face just being a natural landmass and not an alien artifact. It was just a mesa the whole time.

So there is a lot of evidence leading you to believe that the Face on Mars is merely just a natural landmass called a mesa, combined with shadows gives the mass a facelike texture. Lots of research shows you that the mass is very natural and not made by Aliens.            ",0
"The Electoral College is a process made by the founding fathers for the election of presidents by the congress vote. The Electoral College is a process, but it is an unfair process. Americans are supposed to vote for who they desire to be president, not a group of electors in Congress. There is no possible way for Americans to choose their president if at the end of it all, a group of electors make the final choice. According to the Office of the Federal Register, Americans choose the state electors when voting for President because when voting for president, Americans are actually voting for the candidate's electors. It makes no sense then to vote for a president, let's just make it to where we vote for electors because we obviously aren't voting for who we want as president.

The main purpose of voting is to help the candidate American voters want as president to win the election. If popular vote was the way to determine who would be elected as President, everybody would be happy. There are times in an election when everybody is sure that the candidate they voted for is going to win. Americans watch as they see the votes go up by popular vote, but then later, the candidate they thought would win has lost because of the Electoral College. If popular vote was the way Presidents were elected, everything would be made easier without controversy. However, since the Electoral College does play a big role in the election of presidents, popular vote is never going to be a working system. Americans just need to figure out that their vote is never going to really count, but the Electoral College's vote surely will.

In an article by Bradford Plumer, the fact that over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than how we vote now is stated. The Electoral College System is based on Americans voting for the electors that are the candidate's party. When Americans go to vote, they vote for electors who support the President and then the electors choose the president. When Americans go to vote, the banners should just say Vote For Electors. When Americans vote, it is made to seem as they are voting directly for the President they want to be elected. Instead, Americans are actually voting for electors. Multiple times you'll hear the saying, ""Every vote counts."" but really, every vote does not count. No matter how many times Americans vote for their President, the Electoral College has the final say no matter what American's votes are.

The major problem that worries many, is the problem of a tie in the electoral vote. During an election when a tie occurs, the state delegations vote for who will be president. According to the article The Indefensible Electoral College by Bradford Plumer, each state is able to cast one vote and the one single state representative makes the decision for the state. If the point of an election is for the people to vote and choose, there shouldn't even be a option for the one representative to choose. All the votes that were just cast by Americans all go down the drain now. In the case of a tie, all the power and weight goes to the one state representative to choose who becomes the president. The represtative does not care about what the people want, that representative will choose what they want to do with this election. According to Bradford Plummer, during the 2000 campaign, Rhode Island, South Carolina and fifteen other states did not even get to view media markets or campaigns and did not even get to see the candidates. Those states howeve still voted, not knowing anything about these candidates because overall the Electoral College makes the last call.

The Electoral College is an unfair process that also plays a big role in elections. No matter how Americans vote, the Electoral College is going to be the people who elect the president. Americans vote for who they want as their president but the Electoral College simply makes that decision for you. Americans shouldn't even vote, the Electoral College can make that decision. Many people in America simply want the popular vote than to have the process of Electoral College in place. We should all take a vote to abolish the Electoral College. But wait, the Electoral College might say no since they always make the overall decision.",0
"Technology is a fast growing resource in the world today and the availability of such is quickly rising. In many schoools, technology is becoming an important aspect of everyday life. Not only does technology enable students to keep up with classwork outside of school and on days they do not attend but it also allows for more flexibility. If the technology that students use everyday had the ability to determine how they felt about certain lessons, then not only would it benefit them but it would benefit teachers as well.

Technology that can determine someones emotions was once thought to be a thing of the future but now that future is here. Professor Thomas Huang has been able to create a computer algorithm that determines human emotions by scanning their facial expressions. Imagine the possibilities with such software!! The most benefical area in which the computer algorithm could be used in is schools. '""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""' (Huang, Parahgraph 6) Not only would teachers be alerted when students were becoming distracted from their teachings, but they would also be offered suggestions on how to improve the lessons. Software such as the type that Dr. Huang has created could improve test scores across the nation and ease the workload of thousands of teachers. Why not use it?

Hence forth, technology that determines human emotions would be largely beneficial and effective for a large portion of the worlds population. Schools would experiance the most postive results from the software seeing as it would be able to adjust lessons to fit students learning curve and it would also reduce teachers workloads by creating lessons to fit students needs. The only negative aspect of Dr. Huangs software would be the cost of installation, but with the positive outcomes that would follow, whatever cost paid would be well worth it. ",0
"Asking for advice is a crucial part of making a big decision. Many people ask for second opinions when they don't know what they should do, or can't decide on their own. When you as a decision maker do this, it benefits you by giving you a chance to learn from the experience of others, view your situation in a different perspective, and learn more about your choices. All of these are valuable assets that will help you later in life, and maybe even help others if they come to you for advice. Experience is one benefit that definitely will help later on.

The main reason everyone asks for a second opinion is for experience. People who have had to make your decision before will have experience with what happened to them when they made the decision. This will help you try to find the result that will best benefit you. My friend Generic_Name always asks for the opinion of others when trying to make a decision. A great example of this is when she couldn't take a important test, but didn't know when she should make it up. She asked me what she should do, and I told her that when I missed a big test, I tried to find a solution with our teacher beforehand, like taking the test early, or a few days after the actual test date. Generic_Name knew she couldn't take the test early, as she had another activity taking up her time, but she went to our teacher and asked if she could take it later. Generic_Name figured out a solution by asking others for advice, and found the best choice for her using my experience. Now, she can also use both mine and her experience to make decisions later on inn life. Using my experience to find a solution is not the only way for Generic_Name to solve her problem though. She could have asked for a different perspective instead.

Advice from others come in many forms, but most come in the form of a different perspective. Different perspectives help others understand your problem so they can help you, and also you can now rearrange the pieces of your situation to find a solution. It's always better to look at your choices in a new perspective, because you might find it easier to choose the best one for you from that angle. When I was trying to decide which sleep-away camp I wanted to attend this summer, I had to ask my parents and my friends to decide. My parents told me that because one of the camps was extremely expensive, it would be better for me to go to the other one. My friends, on the other hand, told me that instead of choosing one or the other, I should go to a completely different camp, one that has the activities of both previous camps mentioned and cost less than each one. I did not know about this camp, and didn't even consider trying to find a camp with the benefits of both the ones I wanted to attend. But using my friends' wider perspectives, I was able to find a completely new and customized solution for me. They also could have provided important information about the new camp that I was not aware of to advise me on my decision.

Information is a big asset when making a decision, and you can get that information by asking for advice from others. Different people may know certain things about the decision that you need to make. Asking for advice from these people will allow you to gain this information and make a better choice. A study from Harvard University found that when given the choice, 99% of people chose to make a decision with advice from multiple strangers who has had to make the same decision before. Out of that 99%, 98% believed that the choice they made was the best for them. They also believed that the knowledge they gained from talking to the strangers was a big contributing factor to their success. This study shows how truly beneficial advice from others is. It not only helped people make the best decision possible, but also provided new information for the decision maker, who can now pass on that knowledge to others who need help from someone with experience.

In conclusion, when making a decision, asking for multiple opinions is extremely beneficial. You can learn from the experience of others, choose the right choice more easily when looking at different solutions in a new perspective, and gain new information you can pass on to others, thus helping the whole process come full circle. It will benefit you greatly in the long run as well, as you can use anything you gain from these different opinions in future decision making processes. Clearly, it is always better for you to ask for a second opinion, no matter the decision.",0
"Students all over America could benefit from having online conferencing. If students are given the option to attend classes from home, it could help students and teachers decrease their workload and stress. Also, attending classes from home can be important when students can not make it to school and it is beneficial for many other reasons too. All schools should offer students the ability to attend classes from home because it will help students keep up with their classes even if they are unable to go to school, it will help students with their understanding in a subject if they are allowed to re-watch lessons, and it will help students reduce the stress of missing class or not understanding a topic.

First, having online video conferencing or video lessons allows an absent student to remain on track with the rest of the class. For example, Generic_Name, an Algebra 2 student, misses school because he is very sick and since all the material taught by his teacher that day was posted online, Generic_Name does not fall behind in class. Because of the online lesson, Generic_Name knows what happened that day and will not have to waste his or his teacher's time to learn the lesson at school. Now, when Generic_Name returns to school he will not have to catch up with his other classmates, he can continue at the same pace as all the others'. Also, Generic_Name is going out of state for the week and will miss quite a bit of school, but when he gets back all the material he missed will be online and easily accessible. Rather than panicking about asking or emailing all his teachers, Generic_Name has all the material he needs taught the same way that it was in school. Generic_Name can now spend an afternoon or a weekend watching the videos rather than needing to teach himself the material. Being able to view online lessons can save many students who can not attend school, keeping them from falling behind and allowing them to stay on track.

Next, video lessons or online conferencing will help students with their understanding in a subject if they are allowed to re-watch the lessons. Such as, Generic_Name was having trouble understanding a recently learned topic, she could watch the lesson again and see if there was any information she missed or could clarify. Giving the ability to re-watch lessons allows students to perform extensive studying and mastery of a topic. Generic_Name can also get more accurate information rather than notes that may have been rushed or incomplete. Another example, Generic_Name was having a really bad day and could not focus well while the teacher was giving the class a lesson. The online lessons would be very beneficial in this case because Generic_Name would be able to re-watch them once he was feeling better. Doing this would allow Generic_Name to have a second chance rather than grading his work based on what he learned while he was having a bad day, giving him this second chance could drastically alter the results of a graded assignment such as a test or quiz. As you can see, giving students the ability to review in class lessons and material can have great changes in their performance and knowledge in the subject.

Lastly, giving students the option to view lessons online can greatly reduce the amount of stress on a student. An example of this is, Generic_Name missed some important information during a lesson presentation and without being able to re-watch the lesson, he beings to stress and worries that he may not be able to complete his work or even pass the test. Because of such stress, Generic_Name may begin having trouble focusing, lose sleep, and many more similar problems may occur. While if he did not have to worry about missing information as much, he would be much more relaxed and stress free. Also, Generic_Name is worried about a test coming up soon but does not have the proper notes he needs to be completely prepared for it; without the ability to review any in class lessons, this predicament gets him worried and stressed about the test causing him to go hours a day looking for usable study material. Though if he had been able to access the lessons he took in class and re-watch them, he could have written better notes and not stressed about the test as much. Having the lessons allows for all students to clear misunderstanding and reduces stress.

In conclusion having online conferencing or the ability to attend class at home gives students many opportunities and benefits. Such benefits include, allowing students to remain up to date on in class material even if the student is absent, gives students the ability to review material they may have misunderstood, and it will help students reduce the stress of missing class or falling behind the rest of the class. Some may argue that allowing online conferencing allows for too much freedom and can cause students to begin to slack off and not attend school as often. This is completely true, although it does allow students to be slightly more free and flexible, this does not mean that the online conferencing is better; in class schooling will always be better and allows for questions, as the online schooling is a backup if the student is unable to attend school or needs extra help. For these reasons, online conferencing would be a great addition to almost every high school or even college. It provides students with many more possibilities and options when it comes to an unexpected event or inconvenience.",0
"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school,

not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students.",0
"Driving cars are something that many people are looking forewards to in the future. These driving cars are being invented and take alot of money to make. Some of the questions that you may ask yourself are how do they work, where will they work, and are they safe? I personally like the idea of having cars drive by themselves. The reason why is because ther wouldn't be that many accidents, people wouldn't have to worry about getting ran over, and if the driver is drunk or ill they wouldn't cause any wrecks.

They started to put these cars together in the late 1900's. In 1950 GM made a concept car that would run on a track with an electric cable that sent radio signals to the receiver on the front of the car. GM tried to imput these electric cables on the roads but it costed to much to remake the roads. They tried many different methods to make these cars drive but they didn't succed. Until around the year 2000 when technology was starting to advance and played a huge role in our society.

Now these cars have highly imputed sensors that help the car run and keep the driver alert if something malfunctions. These cars also have implied brakes to stop the car in an emergency and vibrating sensors to notify the driver that it needs human skill to help it. These sensors will help detect that something is wrong and to keep the car on the road. There would also be less accidents. Teens would have help from the car and parents help too and wouldn't get in many wrecks.

Finally these cars have pass certain laws and have certain laws put in order to put the cars on the road and also help if the driver gets in a wreck.. Driveless cars have to have a lot more technology imputed so in case of a major emergency it will be able to protect the driver and passengers in the car.

In conclusion many car companies are starting to make driveless cars so we have to be more opened minded and keep up with technology, because our world is going to be changed dramatically and we have to be ready for big changes. These cars are only the beginning of something big. That will change our society in the furture. So what are your thoughts about all this new information?

Are you for or aganist driveless cars?              ",0
"Driverless Cars Good or Bad

Can you imagine a time in the future where no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? Well I couldnt imagine a future without buying cars. To buy a car is what mostly what everyone wishes for. Yes there is no technology coming up and by the years it expands more and more each day, but not because of that means that getting the idea of enventing cars that drive themselves is good.

I am against future cars the drive themselves because first there not even proven all the way safe. These cars can get out of control any day and something bad can happen. In the story it says that states will follow as soon as the cars proved more reliably safe, which means that there not all the way safe. Anything can happen and when the driver has control of the driving they know what there doing. The driver knows if there driving right or wrong, But how will these cars that drive themselves know. Imagine one day the system might not work and the car will automatically fail with the system. These cars are'nt safe and until there not proven safe I am againts it.

The next big reason why I""m against it is all the money there going to watse on these cars just to make them and when they come out. Theres going to be millions possibly millions of dollars to make these cars. Instead of focusing on something like this we can focus on bigger things. We already have cars we can drive we dont need to be expanding and wasting money on things that are'nt as important. Just more tax money coming out of people things will keep pricing up. Theres no point to invent cars to the next level if cars we have now are good enough.

My last reason on why I'm against these cars is the when you drive its freedom. Its a priviledge to drive, and when you drive you feel free. If the future brings cars that drive themselves the freedom of the people will be gone. So bringing cars that drive themselves wouldn't be so great for people who love to drive because they wouldn't feel free. Therefore cars are good just where they are.

Eventhough some may argue that having cars that drive themselves is good for whatever reson they might think, I'm against. So, can you imagine the future were no one needs to buy cars anymore? I couldnt. Theres freedom when you drive. Its good to be able to drive yourself. This is why I'm against ""Cars in the Future"". ",0
"France, Germany , United States, Colombia and other countries are taking actions of the problems that the cars are making. It is true that cars are helpful and make the life easier to some persons but lately the concer of how this machines affect the ecosystem have being increasing. That is  why countries have come with different projects to try to limit the amount of cars they are around their cities. If we see from a different perpestictive the limiting of cars can be a good thing and produce result that are favorable to everyone.

Through the years they have been several projects of reductiond of car circulation and it is visible that the population have apadted to the type of living that cities have imposed.

One example of this is Vauban, Germany were 70 percent of the families do not have a car and 57 percent sold a car to move there. with that example we can see that people can get used to a live where cars are not necesary to have. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I am uch happier this way,"" these are the word of one of the resident of that city that get used to a lifestyle without a car. In that city people get used to walk which is more healty and do not produce any harm to the ecosystem.

Other cities like Paris have made laws to control the amount of pollution cars produce since , this capital have more smog than other European capitals making this a awful fact. With the actions they have made of baning even-numbered license plate on Mondays they have reduced the amount of smog which is good. Another example is what is happening in Bogota, Colombia where you can see car-free days, where people any other mean of transportations except for personal cars. When the actions of both cities atre taken it is visible the cahnge on the enviroment. This great ideas help the crouded cities to reduce their levels of pollition and icentive people on use the car less.

United State that is a country that produces a lot of pollution have seen good changes in the tendenci of the people of using car. Studies have prove that the amount of new cars buied have decrease in the last years. Also there have been a drop of the amount of people getting a license. This show that is a county support public transportation and make programs that will make people use less the cars they will have a positive result.

Walking and using a bike is good for the personal healt. The less using of the cars help the fight against pollution and avoid the rise of temperature in the earth. Obesiti and pollution are a big problen in the last decades but they both share something in common, they can be fought by using less a car and walking, being this the perfect statement that prove why limiting the car usage will be an adventage.

"What would it be like with no cars? with limiting car use there will be big advanteges. What do you think about the limit on car use?

Limitg car use has advantages.""When I had a car I was always tense,I'm much happier this way""(Rosenthal). With a car life can be overpowering, but without a car thats one less thing you need to stress over. ""Drastically reducing greenhouse gases""(Rosenthal). thats one way to reduce the greenhouse effects.

Limiting car uses has advantage. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforces driving ban to clear the air""(Duffer). a car ban will help clean our cities from record bracking pollution.""Pitted sidewalks had been replaced, rush hour was drastically cut, and restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up""(Selsky). since the effort without cars our cities can prosper.

In conclusion without cars will be our best advantage. without car no more stress,greenhouse gases reduced,stopping car pollution, and cities can prosper. this is the effects without car.    ",0
"""I read an interesting article about technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotions. It made me think about whether it would be valuable to use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

On one hand, it could be helpful for teachers to know how their students are feeling. Maybe a student is struggling with a topic and feeling frustrated, but they don't want to speak up in front of the class. If the teacher could see that the student was feeling frustrated through this technology, they could offer extra help or support without making the student feel embarrassed.

However, I also think it could be a bit invasive. What if a student is just having a bad day and doesn't want everyone to know how they're feeling? Or what if the technology isn't perfect and misinterprets a student's expression, leading to misunderstandings or even punishment for something they didn't actually feel?

Overall, I think it could be a useful tool, but it would need to be used carefully and with respect for students' privacy and emotions. Teachers would need to be trained on how to interpret the technology accurately and how to use it to support their students, rather than punish or embarrass them.""",1
"Fellow citizens cars are dying out. Every year more and more people are realizing the cultural and natural impact that cars are having on us in a negative way. There are many advantages that come with eliminating cars from society. For one reason is that we can start to eliminate roads and highways and use that land for houses or something else. Another reason is that it will help the world out in a natural way to stop temperatures from sky rocketing to completely melting the polar cap, and prevent smog from building up in dense cities. citizens also wont have to spend money on fuel or a car anymore and can save money.

As soon as citizens completely wipe out the use of cars then lot of positives will result out of it. As soon as cars are out of the picture then societies can use up the space from highways and roads to make houses and shopping centers that are walking distance from those houses or living communities. When people need to drive long distances to get to another destination thats far away from where they live then they can take theyre car thats on the outskirts of the city in a protected garage, just like they do in Vauban, Germany, they do this in order to keep the city within completely safe and pollutants free from cars.

Up to now and ever since the invention of automobiles like buses and cars the world has changed dramatically in temperature. Earth has become like a microwave just trapping heat from the Greenhouse effect which causes the carbon dioxide from the cars to stay in earth and not expell to space which has caused some of the highest temperatures in the last 100 years. With the elimination of cars less carbon dioxide will be let out causing the eart to cool and thus will help save the polar ice caps. Not only will it save the cold areas of the world but it will also help reduce smog in densely packed cities like Paris and binging. Up to now cities like Paris and Bogota have had certain days where they prohibit the use of cars in the city to help and calm the smog down. This Method has helped dramatically and it was only for one day! Imagine what doing this forever can do for the environment.

Another topic for eliminating the use of cars is the economic change it will postively have on the environment. For one families wont have to spend money on gas. Second they wont have to spend money for a car. Last but not least third they wont have to spend money on tolls or tickets. So simply if you dont have a car you wont have to worry about any of those problems. Families can use all of that saved money for going on vacations or on themselves.",0
"Venus is one of the planets that have the same density and size and used to have mountains,valleys,craters and it also used to have oceans which means it used to have life but the pressure will kill us because the pressure is 90 times stronger than ours.

It is hard to go to venus because sometimes we are farther and sometimes we are closer to venus. All of our space missions to venus have been unmaned because no spacescrafts hasnt survivded the landing longer than a few hours. on the planets surface the atmodspheric pressure is 90 time than on our own planet. venus used to be covered with oceans and had valleys. mountains and craters. NASA want to send people to study venus. a vehicle would be needed to hover across venus surface. systems made by mechanical devices will by crushed by the pressure.

So the exploration of venus will be difficult but we will soon need a planet because once we run out of material we wont be able to go anywhere.",0
"Self-esteem is a crucial aspect of a person's mental health and well-being. It refers to a person's belief in their own worth and abilities. There are many sources of self-esteem, including personal achievements, relationships, and societal expectations.

One of the primary sources of self-esteem is personal achievement. When a person accomplishes something they set out to do, they feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. This can come from anything, from getting good grades in school to running a marathon. Achieving something can also give a person a sense of purpose and direction, which can boost their self-esteem even further.

For example, when a student gets good grades on a test or earns a high GPA, they feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This can lead to increased self-confidence, as they feel like they are capable of achieving more. Similarly, when an athlete wins a game or sets a personal record, they feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This can also lead to increased self-confidence, as they feel like they are capable of achieving more in their sport.

Another way to boost self-esteem through achievement is by setting goals and working towards them. When a person sets a goal and works hard to achieve it, they feel a sense of accomplishment when they finally reach it. This can also lead to increased self-confidence, as they feel like they are capable of achieving more.

To praise oneself and set goals for achievement, it's important to focus on the process rather than the outcome. Instead of just focusing on the end result, focus on the steps it takes to achieve it. Celebrate small victories along the way and give yourself credit for your hard work and dedication. This can help build self-esteem and confidence, as you feel like you are making progress towards your goals.

In conclusion, achievement is a powerful source of self-esteem. When a person accomplishes something they set out to do, they feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. This can lead to increased self-confidence and a sense of purpose and direction. By setting goals and working towards them, and by celebrating small victories along the way, individuals can boost their self-esteem and achieve their full potential.",1
"If there's one thing all students can agree on, it's that summer is the best time of the year. We can also agree that having to complete work assigned over the summer is the worst. Instead of staying home and doing a math worksheet for hours, most students would rather be lying on a beach. Summer gives kids the chance to get a break from the stress that comes with school and having to spend free time doing assignments they don't enjoy. Some schools have started implementing projects assigned to students for them to complete over summer break. These can either be teacher-designed or student-designed, which creates controversy. I believe that schools that require summer projects should be student-designed in order to build creative skills, allow students to explore their interests, and experience more responsibility.

A lot of students often feel stuck when it comes to working on school projects with specific guidelines and topics. Instead, these summer projects would let kids be creative in what they'd like to complete it on. It's very important for students to learn how to be creative, which many jobs need in the future. In the past, some of my favorite projects I've done were the ones where I got to have total control on what it was on. It allowed me to use my creativity for something different and helped me strengthen those skills. Students need to learn how to use their creativity to create a project to better prepare themselves for skills needed in different fields of work. Letting students explore their creativity also helps them enjoy completing these summer projects more. I feel that whenever I'm assigned something over the summer, I dread doing it and then end up finishing it at the last minute. If I had more control over a project assigned to me over the summer, I would have a much easier time completing it. Kids don't like to be constantly restricted, so letting them have creative control over a school project would result in better work. By giving students creative freedom over summer projects, they're able to strengthen their creativity and make a better project overall.

For most students, we don't usually get to choose which classes interest us the most until middle school. Student-designed summer projects allows us to explore things we're more interested in than what we learn in school. I've found myself feeling trapped in a class that I absolutely hate, which makes it much harder for me to do well in that class. When I get to use what I'm interested in to create something like a project, it's a lot easier for me to feel motivated to do so. In middle school, we had to make PSA projects for a couple different classes, which allowed us to choose a topic we like. I chose to do one of mine of adopting dogs instead of buying dogs, and I ended up getting an A on it since it was something I was really interested in researching and informing others of. Students want to learn more about topics that aren't taught in school and these student-led projects will let them do just that. Teachers can expected to receive much better work on projects that students are actually interested in, rather than a boring or confusing topic. This can also help student discover new things that they enjoy that they would've never found out about if they hadn't be assigned the project. New discoveries are beneficially to students who struggle with what they enjoy while trying to think about their future. Students enjoy getting to explain some of the things they find interesting in the form of projects.

Many students are faced with responsibility everyday, but if they have to create their own unique project, they get to experience responsibility that isn't always available to them. Students can learn how to be responsible by experiencing it from something they enjoy. A project that they can design is the perfect opportunity to explore responsibility. Doing those PSA projects was helpful for me because I dealt with the responsibility of completing the project better than I had before. I felt that coming up with my PSA wasn't a chore, but rather something I actually enjoyed. These projects can help teach students that responsibility isn't always something that has to be dreaded or feared. Responsibility can help build character and maturity. Student-designed projects allow students to learn that responsibility can be enjoyable too.

The introduction of summer projects in schools should be student-designed so students can be more creative, learn about new things, and learn how to be responsible. Many could argue that letting students create their own projects gives them false hope that most projects will be the same, but they also let kids experience individualism. Teachers would still have to put some restrictions in order to keep them appropriate and give a standard set of guidelines on what the materials should include. Letting students design their own summer projects helps them grow as they get older to help them for their futures. Many teachers should consider assigning fun projects instead of worksheets over the summer in order to get the best results from students. ",0
"In this article Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author was talking about how the process a computer with a 3-D computer that can model your face and how all 44 major muscles i the model must move like a human. Dr. Huang relies on the work muscles is psyhologists auch as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS whaich stands for ( Facial Action Coding System ).

Dr. Huang had some observations and looking back into the article here is one of the things her said. ""Even through individuals often show varing degrees of exression"" (Like not smiling as boradly).

Making this was perfect right at first because after weighting some different units of the software could even mix up emotions.

Now of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial conveys happyor worried. Throught out more they were coming p with many different ways for the software. Seeingg the Mona Lisa would indeed bring a smile your face. Dr. Huang predicts, "" Then it would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.",0
"Nowadays, technology and science became one of important parts in human life, it makes life runs easier. With human's intelligent, technology is improved day by day. Many things are dicovered, or invented that we don't even know about their appearances. One of them is the Facial Action Coding System also known as FACS, which technology could identify human emotions was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. In my opinion, I think this techonology is useful, especially in order to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future. The creation of FACS is a way to solve this problem, it could read student's thinkings, from that parents and teachers could understand about expected of their kids, or their students. Therefore, they could modify their ideas, lessons to able to suitable. It leads to success in learning of teachers and students; or it could make kids and parents get closer, and decrease the bad things happen.

The use of the technology can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It helps to understand students feelings, or reactions about the lessons, thus the teachers can recognize what are things helpful, and unhelpful. From that, the effective in studying will be increased. Besides that, it also brings advanges in communication between parents and child. The adults could realize their kids are struggling with something or not. Then, they could find the ways to share, or help. In order to not let anything bad could occur, as having negative thinkings and lead to suicide.      ",0
"Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would be an amazing tool in the classroom. With it, lesson plans would be much more tailored to each person, and can easily be changed based on their reaction to the plan. This tool would improve classroom dynamics, improve students' attitudes towards learning, and would improve the overall understanding of more difficult lessons by students.

The classroom dynamic in most classes is not as helpful to students as it should be. When it seems like the whole class understands something, it can be embarrassing to ask for help. With FACS, if a student seems the least bit confused, the software can go over the lesson in other ways until the student is confident about the lesson and can move on. This means a more educated classroom with better grades and higher passing rates on standardized tests, which in turn, helps the school the students attend.

Often times, learning is seen by students as a chore. Reading and note-taking get boring and confusing. But if schools used FACS, the computer would recognize the students feelings toward the lesson and could use a more exciting lesson plan. This would then change how the student may feel about the topic and could even improve a student's mood. This could also improve grades, test scores, and school ratings.

FACS may also improve skills in certain fields. If a student was behind in algebra, a required class for graduation, this software may help keep them on track. Maybe Jane is having trouble with World History. FACS will recognize the confusion through her facial expression and will begin to change the lesson plan, therefore helping Jane and improving her understanding and appealing to different ways of teaching that better suit her.

Although some may say emotion may not be read properly or that emotions are too complex to be read through a few muscles and only six options, the auhtor of the article mentions that certain muscles (risorius and zygomatic major) can determine the difference between and fake smile and a real smile. So who's to say that all emotions don't have that same type of tell. Along with that, this program bases it's conclusion off of fourty-four muscles, and uses percentages of each emotion, which broadens what the person might be feeling instead of generalizing one emotion and working with only that.

In summary, FACS is an ingenius program that would improve classroom work and school function. Working with students and ecognizing their feelings on a topic may help teach them more individually and can lead to their better understanding of the concept. This innovative software would be a great addition to any classroom and would improve life in school. ",0
"So, in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. My job is to carefully read the article and decide wehter or not this technology is useful.

After reading the article I really could'nt decide. When reading about the FACS the first thing that came to my mind was to use this technology on the faces of celeberties. Why? Well it's because it would be fun to do so. In my opinion that's what it's most useful for in classrooms. Sure the teacher could use this technology to teach students about how advanced the humans have become but..

Imagine being a teacher and then one day you introduce the FACS to your students. What do you think the first thing they do would be? I think the first thing they would do is take selfies and let the FACS analyze thier face. Then they laugh at the results. See they are doing it for fun.

This reminds me of disecting frogs in biology. Some students think it's useful for your education while some other students think it's a waste of time, a waste of life for the frogs and that disecting them in the first place is already digusting. But do they do this for fun. NO they don't. They do it to learn about the oragns of the frogs and the purpose of each organ. But is disecting frogs valuable? Yes in my opinion.

So, no I don't think it's classroom valuable to use FACS. But that dosen't mean that you should not let them try it. Here's what the teachers should do. They show the students a picture of someones face. Lets just say for example Mona Lisa. The students will stare at the picture for about a minute carefully looking at every part of Mona Lisa's face. Then the students will decide Mona Lisa's emotion by rating her happiness, sadness, anger, digust or any other kind of emotions. Then after that the teacher uses the FACS on Mona Lisa's face to see if the results for Mona Lisa's emotions from the technology is the same as the results from the students. Human vs Technology there you go.                                  ",0
"Dear Mrs. Principal:

I am writing to inform you that in my opinion, all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year. I think that community service can improve character and also encourage students to help others. Many schools across the country have begun to require a certain amount of community service hours as part of their final grades.

As far as improving character goes, I believe community service can be a huge help. If a student volunteers picking up trash, they will have someone in charge of giving them directions for where and when to pick up trash. They will be required to respect this person and obey this person's instructions, which is what students must do in school very often. I believe that students are purposefully resistant towards teacher and administration figures, but if they have someone outside of school teaching them respect and obedience, their tendency to respect authority figures in school will be stronger.

I also believe community service can build character because of the impact that it can have on your life. Some children have never experienced the feeling of accomplishment when they know they have done something to help another person. If you choose to volunteer in children's hospital, the reactions from the sick children you are helping can be truly inspiring. I think this teaches kids to be grateful, thus building character.

In conclusion, I believe community service can only benefit students in this school. I believe the overall school behavior would improve and I believe we would grow stronger as a school community. Therefore, I think all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year.",0
"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Hey, so I gotta write this essay about curfews and how they can keep teenagers out of trouble. Ugh, I know, it's like, super important and all, but I'm like, totally not a fan of curfews. I mean, I get it, they're like, supposed to keep us safe and all, but like, come on, it's not cool.

So, like, the dangers of being out at night are like, real. There are like, creepy people and stuff, and it's just not worth it. My mom's always like, ""Stay inside, it's not safe,"" and I'm like, ""Okay, mom, I get it."" But like, sometimes I wanna go out and have fun with my friends, you know? And curfews are just like, super limiting.

But like, on the other hand, curfews can be good for us too. Like, they can help us learn to be responsible and all. My mom's always like, ""If you're gonna be out late, make sure you call me and let me know where you are,"" and I'm like, ""Okay, mom, I will."" And it's like, good for me to learn to be responsible and all.

And like, curfews can also help us spend more time with our families and stuff. My mom's always like, ""Let's have dinner together and talk about our day,"" and I'm like, ""Okay, that's cool."" And it's like, good for us to bond and all.

So yeah, curfews might not be the most fun thing in the world, but like, they're important too. They can keep us safe and help us become more responsible, and that's like, totally worth it.

"Dear Principal,

I believe that community service is an important aspect of personal development and citizenship. While some of my friends may view it as a burden, I believe that requiring students to perform community service can have numerous benefits.

Firstly, community service helps students develop a sense of empathy and understanding towards others. By working with people from different backgrounds and experiences, students can broaden their perspectives and gain a deeper appreciation for the challenges that others face. This can help create a more compassionate and inclusive community.

Secondly, community service can provide students with valuable skills and experiences that can be applied in their future careers. For example, tutoring elementary school children can help students develop their communication and leadership skills, while cleaning up litter can teach them about environmental responsibility and teamwork.

Furthermore, community service can help students become more engaged and responsible members of society. By participating in community service, students can learn about social issues and how they can make a positive impact. This can inspire them to become more active in their communities and work towards creating positive change.

I understand that some students may feel that community service takes too much time away from their studies or other activities. However, I believe that community service can actually complement their academic and personal development. It can help students develop time management skills, prioritize their responsibilities, and learn to balance their commitments.

In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of requiring students to perform community service. While it may seem like a burden to some, I believe that it can have numerous benefits for students, the community, and society as a whole. I urge you to consider implementing a community service program for all students.

Sincerely,

"The author Waldo Emerson wrote a statement or quote that it say ,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" basing on my point of view or experiences, I agree with him, I think the same, we will never grow if we keep doing the samething that we already mastered.

I'm taking this position on this issue becasue I have my reasos to sopport my position and to explain why this author is right.

First reason is on point of view if you're already mastered in something and you're keep doing it , to be better or go beyond then my opinion is that you're wasting your time on something unnesesary because you're already mastered , just be happy with what you have and knows a sample are the

Childrens they always wanna something if they have it they want more and more or when they are playing they wanna play possiblely the all day when they realize the day is already gone but they don't care because they think that they have enough time to play so it is the same with us. sometimes we wanna be betters than another people or just feel good but we're wasting our time in somethin that we already mastered.

Secondly the author Emerson show us the true in a quote we can stop doing something that we already mastered we could try to do something else or try to learn something new that can help us in the future of that way we can start growing because we start to learn about differents things so we have more knowledge and we can survive and we can realize or knows how the life looks like. A sample to be a boss you need to know or have more knowledge at least than yours employs or to be amanager you have to know many things.

Finally unless you try to do it better or be better than the rest of the people always is gonna be someone else who is better than you then that time you're wasting doing something beyond than you knows ,use it to teach someone else or learn about some else how to be better in something , teaching someone else or learning from someone else you can start to grow. A example is a old brother he learn about his parents and also teach and care his youngest brother of the way he is starting to growing up because his taking a responsability .The example can show us that we need to about experiences or advices or people who has more knowledge of that way .

In conclusion for these reason and supporting with examples that I wrote, I agree and think the same with The author Waldo Emerson , I took this position because If we try to do something beyond what we already mastered, we will never grow. Also we wasting our time and we could use that time to learn from someone something else what we do not know or teach to someone else about our knowledge . what we can help us to grow or be better in the future concluding I agree with Emerson's statement.",0

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College for Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there have been calls for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it essential to our democratic process.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner of the electoral vote invariably wins with a clear majority and, as a result, disputes over the outcome are less likely to occur compared to a popular vote system. This stability is important for maintaining the integrity and legitimacy of our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. It prevents candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated regions and requires them to campaign across the country. This fosters a sense of representation for all Americans, regardless of the size or population of their state, and ensures that the president has broader support.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method in the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states. This means that voters in these states become more engaged and informed about the candidates' policies and positions. The election outcome is thus determined by the most thoughtful and well-informed voters, ensuring that the decision reflects the interests and concerns of a diverse range of citizens.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states in the political process. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which gives smaller states more representation, is counterbalanced by the weight given to large states in the Electoral College. This ensures that candidates cannot focus solely on densely populated areas and must take into account the concerns of both small and large states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner who receives a majority of electoral votes. This avoids the complications and uncertainties that can arise from run-off elections and provides a more efficient and straightforward process for determining the President.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable and effective method for electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, ensures the representation of swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers numerous benefits that cannot be easily dismissed.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will consider these points when evaluating any proposals for changing our current election process. It is crucial that we preserve and strengthen the integrity of our democratic system for the benefit of all Americans.

Sincerely,

"Sometimes in life, advice may be needed in any type of situation. Yes advice could be told by one person, but I believe it is better if a person is given advice from multiple people. I feel this way, because using different people's advice, in the same situation at the same exact time, could work better than listening to one person. Also seeing different perspectives from different people can make a person see a situation differently and how they might want to solve it.

First, Using multiple people's advice in unison can work better than just taking one person's advice. Look at different types of sports players. They learn different techniques from a line of coaches, teammates, and trainers to then use everything they've learned from all of these people at the same time. They know more than the average person and this makes them better in that sport. Take Stephen Curry for example, being one of the best guards in the league, he has had to get advice from all of his coaches, trainers etc. Now he uses everything that he has learned to become one of the best point guards in NBA history.

Secondly, seeing different perspectives or opinions from different people can make a person see a situation differently. Seeing how two people may think differently can make the person who is taking the advice see things differently and have another route to go with in their decision. In movies that have ghosts of Christmas spirits, the ghost takes the main characters to see themselves, but from a different view. This makes the main character change their ways. This is how seeing perspectives change the way people think.

In conclusion, advice from multiple people at a time helps a lot, because using different people's advice at the same time can make a person better at whatever they are doing. And also because seeing more than one perspective from multiple people can make whomever think differently about how they may want to solve their problem.                    ",0
"Dear Senator, Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" Posner Though the lack of control over the president of the United states election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of backup to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, heshe votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winnertakeall"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts hisher vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from hisher presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spoton. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society heshe lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for hisher representatives pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of malapportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and coordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.",0
"I think its not fair because some people have a hard time with concentrating in certain classes.

I think it should be a D and below to not be able to play in sports or other activity's. My opinion is that I think it is unacceptable to have a below C average because i think that just means there not there for education there just at school for friends and other things that are not educated. So i think they should still be able to participate in sports or other activity's still unless once again if it's a D or below. If people that had to leave because something bad happened to them or a family member that would not be fair to them . So if my principle changed the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activity's unless they have a B average then that would not be right at all.",0
"Every day we make multiple decisions. Some decisions may be easy and not require much thought. Some decisions may require tons of deliberating and cause copious amounts of anxiety. People in these situations often reach out to multiple people for advice. Some choose to talk to friends, family members, or even online forums dedicated to similar issues. Seeking multiple opinions before making a choice is beneficial because people often have different points of view, there are multiple options to choose from, and an individual may feel reassured when others share their opinion.

When seeking the advice of others, it is important to ask many different people. Everyone has their own experiences that shape their opinions and outlook on the world. It is possible that someone may have endured a similar situation and could share their solution. Many people choose to confide in loved ones when facing a challenge. As mentioned previously, there are a number of people willing to help make a strenuous decision. There are even TV shows and radio stations dedicated to solving problems.

When people are stressed they typically cannot think clearly. Sometimes, it feels like there is nothing they can do to escape their situation. Once an individual feels hopeless, they lack the motivation necessary to resolve a conflict. Seeking opinions from others can positively impact someone in a situation like this. Asking for advice will most likely multiply solutions for a problem and provide hope.

Maybe a person could have already resolved a conflict, but is not sure they ended it properly.

Reaching out for advice can make someone confident in their decision. Some people may even tell others about their situation to feel better about themselves. When hearing positive reinforcement, many people feel as if they have made the best decision. This could potentially motivate them to make similar choices in the future, or suggest that others take similar courses of action.

As seen in the previous paragraphs, there are countless reasons as to why someone would want to hear multiple opinions before making a decision. An individual could simply want to hear different opinions, have many options, or feel reassured. Humans are social creatures and greatly value the opinions of their peers. It is no surprise that communicating with others has so many benefits. It is clear that making decisions is much easier when asking multiple individuals because people have different outlooks on life, the possibilities become abundant, and positive reinforcement is gained.",0
"As technology progresses, is the new era of education online? Many students have begun to enroll in online classes where the student learns from home. Distance learning allows students to learn by way of online or video conferencing. I think many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, since online classes allow students to work on their own time, which helps them work on what they struggle, and let's students work on their own schedule.

One benefit of online learning from home is that students can learn and do their work on their own time. A student can spend as much time as they need on any one subject, so the student can allot more time to work on any classes or concepts that they're weak in. Since students don't have to work with a group of 30 other kids trying to get help from the teacher on different topics, the student can work by themselves and shape their education around their own needs. The student won't have to waste time learning something that they already understand.

Another benefit to at-home learning is that students wouldn't have to wake up early to get to school, so they wouldn't be sleep deprived during class. Many students participate in after school activities such as sports or a job, which requires them to get home late, so students often stay up late getting school-work done, then have to wake up and get ready before the sun has risen. This means that many students are tired in class, and aren't able to learn in school. Attending classes from home would eliminate this problem, since students can take classes when they want, at a time that best fits their schedule.

Some may argue that attending classes from home would not benefit the student. This is because students won't be able to ask a teacher questions, and won't be able to retain information while looking at a screen. However online classes won't put students at a disadvantage. The students won't have in-person time with a teacher, but they would be able to submit any questions they have online. Also, there is no evidence showing that students can't learn from a screen. In fact, online learning may be a more effective way to learn than sitting in class for 7 hours each day.

In conclusion, distance learning would be beneficial to students because they are able to individually shape their learning, which helps them work on specific concepts that they struggle on. Distance learning is also beneficial because it better accommodates students' schedules and allows students to work on their own time. Online learning is the future of education.",0
"I am in favour of including meditation and mindfulness practices in schools, especially at higher grades. These practices can help students to cope with stress, manage their emotions, and improve their academic performance. In this essay, I will present some arguments in favour of meditation and mindfulness practices at school.

First, meditation and mindfulness practices can help students to cope with stress. Stress is a common problem among students, especially those in higher grades. The pressure to perform well in exams, the fear of not meeting expectations, and the demands of daily life can all contribute to stress. Meditation and mindfulness practices can help students to relax, reduce their stress levels, and improve their overall well-being. For example, a study by the University of British Columbia found that high school students who participated in a mindfulness-based stress reduction program showed significant reductions in stress and anxiety.

Second, meditation and mindfulness practices can help students to manage their emotions. Emotions play a significant role in the lives of students, and they may sometimes find it challenging to regulate them effectively. Mindfulness practices can help students to be more aware of their emotions, understand them better, and manage them in a healthy way. For example, a study by the Journal of School Psychology found that students who participated in mindfulness practices showed improvements in emotion regulation skills and reduced levels of depression.

Lastly, meditation and mindfulness practices can help students to improve their academic performance. These practices can enhance concentration, focus, and cognitive flexibility, which can all contribute to better academic outcomes. For example, a study published in the Journal of Applied School Psychology found that students who engaged in mindfulness practices showed improvements in executive functioning skills, such as planning, working memory, and cognitive flexibility.

In conclusion, I believe that schools should include meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day. These practices can provide a range of benefits for students, including reduced stress, improved emotion regulation skills, and enhanced cognitive functioning. By incorporating these practices, schools can help to foster a more positive, healthy, and supportive learning environment for their students.",1
"Social media has become a big part of our lives and has had a huge impact on society. It's changed the way we communicate, interact and share information. But, has it had a significant impact on societal norms and values? In my opinion, it has.

Firstly, social media has made it easier for people to express their opinions and connect with others who share the same views. This has created a platform for people to speak out against injustices and push for change. For example, the #BlackLivesMatter movement started on social media and quickly gained momentum, bringing attention to the systemic racism and police brutality that black people face. Without social media, it may have been harder for this movement to gain traction.

Secondly, social media has also had a significant impact on the way we consume news and information. With just a few clicks, we can access a wealth of information on current events, opinions, and perspectives. This has made it easier for people to stay informed and make informed decisions. However, it's also led to the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can be harmful.

Lastly, social media has changed the way we interact with each other. It's made it easier to connect with people from all over the world and form communities around shared interests. However, it's also created a culture of comparison and competition, where people feel pressure to present a perfect image of themselves online. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values. It's changed the way we communicate, interact, and consume information. While it's had many positive effects, such as providing a platform for marginalized voices and making it easier to stay informed, it's also had negative effects, such as spreading misinformation and creating a culture of competition. It's important for us to be aware of these impacts and use social media responsibly.

Note: This essay is written as if it were a grade 8 student, with small spelling and grammar mistakes, but still conveying the message effectively.",1
"Attending online classes is a great idea and is extremely benefitcial for people. It is a great way to give students the oppritunity to learn without being stressed with the idea of being surrounded by students and teachers for 35 hours a week. Online schooling has been an open and welcoming option for many students to participate in. Studies have shown that 35 precent of students prefer online school than traditional school. This is because, it allows students to work at their own pace, time and it can give them a better learning experience.

One thing schools do not understand and value is comfort, that is something that online schooling provides. Students all over get the priviledge to work in the comfort and safety of their own home. It has been shown that people work better in an environment they are familure with and comformtable in. Schools also do not really value students and their personal battles like they claim they do. Some students suffer extreme social anxienty and sometimes can not get through a school day without breaking down. Being home gives said student more resources that can actually help the student recover.

Some students also deal with a heaping amount of bullying on a normal basis, that once again, schools hardly actally do anything about. Online schooling can give students reassurence that they are in a safe place and that no one can hurt them.

Another benefit to online schooling is being able to choose the pace you want to work at. In a traditional school you have a time limit to how much you learn and how fast you have to learn it. Online school counteracts this because students are able to work at a pace they desire. Some students thrive in a fast pace work enviornment, while others need more time to actually understand and retain the information. With that being said, some students need more one-on-one time with teachers and that is harder when you are in a classroom with up to 25 people.

Going back to the retaining information part, the brain requires 9 hours of sleep to function properly and to keep information it is being feed throughout the day. Sleep is very important, but some students do not get the daily recommended amount of sleep because of homework, jobs, sports and school clubs they have to attend.

64 percent of students say the reason they are not getting enough sleep is because schools either start too early or end too late. Online schooling completely erases that because the students are in control of their own schedules. Giving students the opprotunity to work on their own schedules can give them the time to actually learn things, turn in and complete work on time and give them the feeling of accomplishment.

Online schooling is an incredible option for students to consider, especially if they have certain issuse. Not even just that, online school has amazing beneifits that traditional schools do not offer. It provides a more flexible schedule that moves around you and your life, not the other way around. ",0
"When you join an extracurricular activity there's no telling what you can do! You could pass that test,win the football game or you could even make a new friend. Yes, the possibilities are endless when you join an extracurricular activity. But some people think that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time and that they don't really matter in the life.

But I think extracurricular activities contains many benefits to the typical school student. Such as, fitting in better at school,making new friends,and even improving your grades.

When you're in an after school club you'll fit in better by joining the club that best suits you. You can do what you enjoy best while even meeting new students and getting to know them as well. Meeting people that share the same interests as you, will most definitely help you fit in the school. Being the new student in school is scary and stressful. But if you join an after school club then you will definitely fit in better at the school.

Joining an after school club is a great way to be with your friends more and make new friends at the same time. School doesn't have to be the limit when it comes to being with your friends. And when you both join the same club you could spend more time together while doing your favorite things. Such as, being in the same team in a sport or acting in the theater. You and your friend could make new friends and hang out as a group.

If fitting isn't an issue then maybe your grades are. Joining in after school activities could improve your grades on certain subjects that you're struggling on.

Joining in these clubs could significantly improve your grades and help you better understand the subject. And if you do understand the subject then maybe you could help the other students that could still have trouble understanding. Not only would your grades improve but everybody else's that got your help.

In conclusion, I think everybody should join an extracurricular activities since it has many benefits to the average student. Participating in these activities could help you fit in better at school by being part of a group in a school like being in the chess club or football team. Being in these activities could also give you the opportunities to make new friends by meeting new people that share the same interests as you do. Joining these clubs could also give you the chance to bring your grades up and help you pass that test. So yes, I think everybody should join an extracurricular activities since it has many benefits for the students and the teachers.                ",0
"Based on ideas and information in the article about advantages of limiting car usage, people are giving up their cars because of reasons such as, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in places where their reason for it is so they can experiment the outcome of it for a more secure data. Even though in the article it says that car ownership is allowed but, at the same time the amount of money for a parking place, $40,000, is way too much for people to afford. People also choose to live without an automobile because of how much it saves them in greenhouse gas, and other expensive things that car usage takes up. Experts and other people think that limiting the use of car transportation will make cities more denser, and will make it easier for everyone to get around without having issues. In some places, there are people who rather take a car wherever they go for better advantage, but in other places like in the United States, they are promoting ""car reduced"" communities, or for another example, in Paris, officials have ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Studies shows that in the U.S, Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and people are starting to not get their licenses as each year goes by. The populaton growth of the number of miles that people have driven in the U.S, the number has peaked in 2005, but then steadily dropped shortly after. Therefor, people are starting to take advantages of just walking or finding their own ride places to save them money. If you lived in Paris and got fined $31 for having an even numbered license plate, or on the other day got fined for an odd numbered license plate, walking or taking a different kind of transportation would probably be a good decision for you. In the outcome of that, the article states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to their fine. France has a policy that rates diesel fuel higher than gasoline and the results of that 67 percent of diesel vehicles were compared to 53.3 percent of diesel vehicles in all of Western Europe, this is all because of the ""Smog"". A thing called ""car-free day"" takes place in Bogota, Colombia, and in this situation, according to the article, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated and even took buses to all the places they had to be, which in return of that, the streets were left eerily devoided of all possible traffic jams. On this ""car-free"" day, car use is banned for the whole day leaving people with only having the choice of taxis and buses to take them to work, or anywhere else they had to be. Not to mention there are 7 million people who live in the certian place, so this makes this event more difficult for most people. One of the reasons for ""car-free"" day is to take away stress, and lower air pollution throughout all of Bogota, Colombia. Limiting car usage seems to be a good resourse, there could be some bad pieces to it but, in most cases i like the idea of saving money.     ",0
"For years I've heard that voting time is the choice of the people. But with Electoral College, it's not about the people it's about the slate electors. When voting for what president the people want, they aren't voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors. But if two people are going for president, and one wins the national popular vote but the other has more electors votes the one with more electors votes will be president. I think changing the election to popular voting for the president would be better than Electoral College, I'm not the only one that agrees.

When voting time comes around you see a lot of publicity about each person running for office months before the actually voting time. And between that time of the publicity starts and to the voting date you are picking which person you want in office. You may do some research, listen to all the radio or TV interviews, andor watch all the speeches each person does. The whole time you are set on one person to be president. But yet you can't vote for them, because of Electoral College. You vote for the slate electors, the electors vote for the president. Maybe your slate elector doens't want that person, they can vote for the other runner. Voters can't always control whom their electors votes for. Sometimes voters get confused on the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

To pick a electors to depends on the state. Maybe it's a state convention, state party's central committee who chooses, maybe the presidential candidates themselves even. It's not always the people's choice on who is president. It has happened before, two people gone for president, one gets more national votes while the other has more electors votes. And of course, the one with more electors votes goes into office. Even though the people decided they wanted the other runner.

During elections the runner for president tend to only pay attention to the more populated state such as California, New York, Florida, and Texas rather than the smaller states that have less number of electoral votes like Hawaii, Alaska, North and South Dakota, or New Hampshire.

According to Bradford Plumer in ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and AFLCIO all agreed on getting rid of electoral college. Over 60% of votes would rather have a direct election to having Electoral College. They rather have a president win by popular vote than having slate electors vote on a president for them.

Voting for a leader of your country should be the people's choice. Not slate electors. It should be by popular vote, not Electoral College's vote. I say listen to the people, vote on popular vote.",0
"Receiving multiple opinions from different people can help out a lot. Sometimes when people ask for advice, they don't always want to follow that specific person's advice. This is why receiving multiple opinions is better for some people. Seeking multiple opinions can help because it can allow you to understand through different point of views, It can help to get ideas on what you should do, and it allows people to understand where you're coming from. This is why people seek multiple opinions.

Seeking multiple opinions can allow you to see, listen to, and understand different people's point of views and how their advice can be beneficial in different ways. They might have a different perspective on what you think you should do, or what someone else thinks you should do, because we all think differently. Understanding where people are coming from, even if you disagree can also help you come up with one executive decision. For example, there could be an occasion where you want these nice shoes , but you don't have enough money so you go and ask for people's advice on what you should do. One person says, ask a family member for the money. You ask another person, they say steal the shoes from the store. In this scenario it allows you to think and understand what both people are trying to say and the benefits of each and then you can come down to which is a better choice. Stealing shoes from the store could get you in a lot of trouble, So the clear choice is to ask a family member.

Seeking multiple opinions can also allow people to see where you are coming from so they can try their best to give you the best advice possible. If they try to take a step in your shoes, and feel how your feeling about the situation then they can process and understand exactly whats happening and what they have to say about it. For example, if you are really sad about something and you talk to your friends about it, it allows them to feel empathy, and try to understand why you are sad, and what they can do to help you. Them seeing things through your point of view allowed them to feel what you are feeling which is why its easy and beneficial to get advice from multiple people. Especially people you trust.

Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you can get ideas and see what choice you can make based off of those opinions. Like if you were to need opinions on what color to paint your room, people would most likely give you different colors. Sometimes multiple people give you the same opinion when that occurs in a case like this, you'd usually go with whatever people think the most. For example, if six people said you should paint your room blue, and everybody else said different colors, you'd most likely paint it blue based of what peoples opinions were. Receiving opinions in this case is very beneficial to see what people think, and gather ideas

In conclusion, There are many ways seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinons help because, you can see things in different people's point of view, you can collect and gather peoples opinions and turn them into ideas, and it gives people a chance to show empathy, and be in your shoes.",0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an opinion essay as an 8th grade student:

Finishing high school in three years is a controversial topic that has been debated for a long time. While some people argue that it's a great idea, others think it's a bad one. In my opinion, finishing high school in three years is not a good idea.

First of all, students who finish high school in three years are at a disadvantage compared to their peers who take the traditional four-year route. They miss out on important social experiences that help shape their personalities and prepare them for college or the workforce. For example, they don't have time to join clubs, sports teams, or volunteer groups, which are essential for building leadership skills and making new friends.

Secondly, finishing high school in three years can be stressful and overwhelming for students. They have to take on a heavier course load, which can lead to burnout and decreased motivation. They also have to deal with the pressure of graduating early, which can be a lot of stress for a teenager. In my opinion, it's better to take things at a slower pace and enjoy high school rather than rushing through it.

Furthermore, finishing high school in three years can limit students' options in terms of college and career choices. Many colleges and universities have specific requirements for admission, and finishing high school in three years may not meet those requirements. Additionally, some careers require a traditional high school diploma, so finishing early may not be beneficial in the long run.

Finally, finishing high school in three years can have negative impacts on students' mental health. They may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers, which can lead to depression and anxiety. They also may not have time to explore their interests and passions, which can lead to a lack of purpose and direction after graduation.

In conclusion, finishing high school in three years is not a good idea. It can lead to a lack of social experiences, increased stress, limited college and career options, and negative impacts on mental health. While some students may be able to handle the challenges of finishing early, most students will benefit from the traditional four-year route.",1
"Everyone has their own opinion on the way our Presidents are elected. Some say they would prefer popular votes rather than electoral votes, while others believe we should keep it the same way. I believe that it is more fair and less kayotic having popular votes rather than electoral votes. I believe that popular votes keep it fair when it comes to choosing a Presidant and does not cause a lot of fights. Although I believe this some say that electoral voting is also safe and keeps people under control.

Some United states citizens, including me, believe popular votes are more fair and are more of peoples choices. Lots of citizens believe that with electoral votes it's not fair because with electoral votes candidates don't spend time in all the states, some states don't even see campaign ads. Also it's fair because that means that lots of people truly want that candidate for Presidant. Just like when Al Gore won the popular votes, which mean more poeple like him and thought he would be a great President, lost the whole campaign cause of electoral votes. Citizens also get more say if it were for just popular votes and with elctoral votes not so much because even if their is a tie people don't choose, House of Representatives do.

As for others they are completly against popular votes and think that electoral votes are more safe and calming for many reasons. It keeps it fair because it isn't based off which candidate put more comersuals out there or who people know more. With electoral voting you are voting for the electors in The Electoral College who then vote themsevles and are then are counted by Congress. Also with electoral votes not lots of arguing could happen. With popular votes people may begin to argue about who deserved it more cause more peple knew him rather than the other candidate. ""Also it more fair because each state has their own group of electors so they know who is better for their state."" (source 1, paragraph 5)

Although everyone ahs their opinions I believe that popular votes are a better way to vote rather than electoral voting because it's more fair to citizens and less kayotic. Their are many facts and evidence in this world and i history to show that popular voting is more aficient than electoral voting.    ",0
"During the school year, school work assigned by teachers can be exhausting for the students, and create a weight that can drag a student's well being down like a sinking ship.

Many students around the world simply receive assignments from teachers without having a say in how they learn the information.

Students should at least be able to choose how they learn information over the summer in order to get a break from the stress associated with teacher-assigned work.

This will help students learn at their own pace, Learn more about their interests, and also potentially find a career that they're happy with, along with gaining independence.

Allowing students work at their own pace could not only allow them to learn more, but could also alleviate a good portion of stress associated with teacher-assigned projects.

For example, doing research the student's own way rather than following a specific rubric would make the project less specific, allowing the student to create a product that is more their own.

Doing this could also allow students to be more creative and have fun with what they're learning about.

This will change their attitude towards learning new material, and allow them to approach learning with a positive attitude in future school years.

Many students have specific interests for what they want to do as a profession.

If they can choose a project that they're interested in, it can allow them to further pursue their passion.

This could potentially lead them to a college scholarship, and eventually a successful career.

For example, for Generic_Name who is interested in geology, but doesn't have the resources to explore, giving them the opportunity to create a project could be a huge benefactor for helping them learn more, as well as giving them potential college opportunities.

However, many teachers believe that giving students a topic and guidelines to work with could help their research skills and benefit them for future projects.

This may be true, but having students work on a project about a topic they're not interested in doesn't do them any good in the long run.

You can't force a person to like a certain topic.

Letting them choose their own project creates more motivation to do the research, as well as present a cleaner finish product.

In conclusion, giving students the opportunity to create their own project could lead to an abundance of paths going forwards.

It could allow them to expand their knowledge of a topic of interest, creating an option for a major in college.

It also allows students to learn and conduct research at a comfortable pace, allowing them to enjoy what they're learning about, as well as form a product that resonates their personality and vibe.

Lastly, it gives them an opportunity for independence, which will prepare them for other challenges in the real world.               ",0
"I agree with Policy 1 because students bring there phones anyways and because if some reason something happens they can always call there parents. Or for example a student gets hurt and a teacher or a nurse cant find there parents phone numbers they can get there phone and look for the numbers. I also agree that they should be turned off during class time because most students text during class or they do impropriate stuff and they can get in trouble. Plus if the cell phones are on during class time they should get in trouble because there's no need for them to be on cause teachers never know if the students are taking picture of them or if there taking impropriate pictures of one an other.

Cell phones being on during lunch and free periods is good because what if a student needs something or they forgot it at home. Or if a teacher says something to them and they don't like it they can call there parents or who ever is in charge of them to come speak to them. Perhaps some parents want them to call them during lunch to see how they are , well some parents. I strongly agree and slightly disagree because some student take advantage of it and don't fallow the rules. I do agree because some may need it in case of an emergency.",0
"Failure is an inevitable part of life that most experience in some way. But does failure need to be present in order for all of us to enjoy success? Some people might argue that it does, but I disagree. I believe that failure is not necessary to have success, and that it can have a negative effect on enthusiasm.

Many of us perceive failure as a necessary part of the journey of life towards success. Failure teaches us lessons and sometimes strengthens our determination. However, for many of us, failure can be a crushing blow that completely destroys our enthusiasm. Depending on the individual, failure can cause us to give up and become discouraged. It can make us feel unworthy or incapable of achieving future goals, which can harm the state of our enthusiasm. With this in mind, I argue that failure does not necessarily have to be present to have success; rather, it can stunt our enthusiasm and thus prevent us from achieving success.

To illustrate this point, I will refer to my own personal experiences. A few years ago, after failing the same test over and over, I felt completely discouraged and ready to give up. I thought that because I failed at one task, I was incapable of achieving all my other goals. This brought my enthusiasm to a complete standstill, and I felt ready to throw in the towel. At this moment, I realized that failure doesn’t have to be present in order to succeed. Instead, I understood that my attitude towards failure was what had to change. By being more aware of my expectations and being confident in myself, I was able to push forward and find success despite the failures I had faced in the past.

In conclusion, failure is not necessary to have success, and it can have a debilitating effect on enthusiasm. Despite the life lessons that failure can teach us, it can also be detrimental to our well-being when we become too fixated on it. I urge us all to remember that success does not have to be preceded by failure, and to be more confident and accepting of ourselves after setbacks. That way, we can have a much better chance of achieving success.",1
"Should students be forced to take an extracurricular activity? I don't take they should for many reasons. Taking extracurricular activities can increase work and responsibility, take time away from more important areas, or even cause stress. A student should only take an extracurricular activity if they know that they'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can negatively affect the student in many ways.

Taking an extracurricular activity means more work, and considering the amount of work students already have, it can be overwhelming. Many students won't be able to complete all their assignments because of the extra activity. This can lead to lower grades and worst performance in other classes. Not only will students have more work, they will also have to manage their time in order to be able to consistently participate or show up for that activity.

You might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong, but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. When students take extracurricular activities, they take away from their free time in order to put it in their schedule. Students use their free time to do their homework, relax from work, or spend with their family. This is pretty important for a student, considering that this may stress them out. This leads into our final reason.

The increased amount of work and responsibility, combined with managing time efficiently, can be enough to overwhelm student to the point where they get stressed. Students might not be able to keep up with all the work they get from their extracurricular activity plus all their other classes. As stated before, this can lower grades, and force students to take time away from those classes just to focus on their extracurricular activity. Stress is very serious problem already, and it can be beneficial not to force a student to participate in an activity that they don't want to do.

In conclusion, taking an extracurricular activity can have negative affects. It starts with unnecessary work, which leads to taking time away from other things, which finally leads to stress. Many students already do extracurricular activities, mainly because they enjoy it. But some students need time to focus on other things they might find more important, which isn't a bad thing. Students shouldn't be forced to join an activity, but they should always have the option to.",0
"I think that it is a neat idea to have driverless cars but only if all of the things that could go wrong have been evaluated. I can also tell you that they will never work out everything that could go wrong no matter how much they think they have. What if there is a malfunction and the car swerves and drives off of a cliff. That wouldn't be the drivers fault it would be caused by faulty technology. There would have been nothing that the driver of the vehicle could have done to prevent that from happening. What happens if one of these cars runs into another car because the technology stopped working. As stated in the passage would it be the drivers fault or the manufacturer.

You have to keep all of these things that could go wrong in mind you can't just think about the upsides of these smart cars. It would be neat to have a car drive for you i'll admit that and that is amazing that we're working on something that can do that and that we have became that technologically developed. There is just many things that need to be taken into consideration. There are so many ways someone could get hurt in something like this smart car. I think it would just be safer to not have these type of cars out and about on the street. What if they malfunctioned and ran a pedestrian over and neither the person in the car or the pedestrian walking would have seen it coming. There are already so many people being killed by drunk drivers now a days. I think achieving the development of this kind of technology would just make the death rate go up and this world doesn't need that happening it is already heart breaking how many people die in a day already.

People should not have to dread walking around if they do not have a vehicle just because they fear of this technology hitting them. They would have to take the necessary precautions in order to have this kind of technology on the streets. I don't think that the developers think of all the dangerous things that could happen by having these cars. They all just think of how cool it would be to drive a smart car. Well I can tell you that I think that to many people die from drunk drivers or people that aren't paying attention to where they are going when they are driving around. Yeah were still going to have people die from these things. We don't however need there to be more people dying because of faulty technology.

They can think that they have worked every kink out in their technology but, I can assure you that they haven't. There is always going to be a risk of something happening with this kind of technology. It's not just safe because the manufacturers say that it's safe that is just not how it works. All i'm saying is that we should be more concerned with what could go wrong than what is cool. I would rather be safe walking on a sidewalk then not wanting to leave because im scared of dying. I think that we just need to stop being lazy it's just steering a steering wheel it's not rocket science.",0
"Joining the Seagoing Cowboys progam can benefit recovering countries and yourself. If you enjoy helping people in need and traveling the world then you'll want to sign up for this progam. Some reasons why you should the program ar being aware of other countries and their needs,experiencing several countries' history and culture, and helping ruined countries.

In paragraph two, the passage explains that many countries were left in ruins after World War two. It states,""To help countries recover their food suppliers, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

In paragraph nine it said that it opened up the world to me. I stated ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. It stated that the awareness stayed with me and it lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. In paragraph five, I stated,"" The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveale oppurtunity for a small-town boy,"" I also said,""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special."" In the passage I said .""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water."" I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canalo on my way back to China. I had the privilage of traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures and several coutries' history.

In conclusion, I believe that you and many ruined countries will benefit from this progam. It is something that you will always remember and will stick with you throughout you're life. You will also benefit from it greatly for many reasons that I have already stated before hand.           ",0
"For some people having a car is a neccesity, but for others it can just be stressful. I believe it is much safer with out cars. There would be less accidents ,

less pollution and it would save people a lot of money .

In Paris they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the smog. If there were drivers out on the road they got fined. This didnt stop everyone, there was counts of 4,000 people being fined for driving. Just five days after the partial ban congestion went down 60 percent.

Just Imagine if five days of no driving caused congestion to go down 60 percent, how much would it go down if cars were eleminated all together.

There are some disadvantages to not having a car. Such as not being able to get where you need to go on time, biking or walking far places, getting sweaty before work or school ect.

Driving can also be very stressful, for example when businessman Carlos said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". This statement suggest that it is stressful to drive a car.

In conclusion, I would definitally want to have a car so i could get where i needed to go on time. I would also like to reserve the car only if i really needed to use it.    ",0
"The Face on Mars is not what everyone thinks it is. Hollywood shows, magazines, and radio talk shows can exaggerate to make the landform sound like more than what it truly is. As a NASA scientist, I believe that you should know exactly what this historic landmark is, so you know the correct story for years to come.

First, you never know what publicity will do with the next big story. Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. ""Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.

To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. ""....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.

In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that students should have cell phones during school for 3 reasons. one reason is to inform their parents if something has happened. Also, sometimes other students wants to talk to another student from a different table but they can't get up. Finally, because the parents can tell the parents if something has occurred.

Students should be able to use their phones to inform their parents about some issue that happened recently. Also, sometimes the kid can tell their parents if someone is annoying them and is tempted to fight them, they can tell their parents the situation and the parents can give the student some advise or go and get them before things get out of hand. The parents can also tell the students that their parents are wondering if they can go in for a meeting and they wanted to talk to the teachers.

Many times us students want to go and talk to our other friends about something that happened to them but cant because they cant get up from their seat. The student can send them a text so that they can remain seated and not break the rules. Also you might have a brother or sister and you wanted to tell them something but you cant.

The parents can tell the students that someone past away and you're really close to that person. Your parents can also tell you that they are on their way to pick you up from",0
"Most people you see cleaning up the community are people who have gone to jail or there told they would have to clean to do community service. Doing community service will not only help out the environment, but it helps out with the community as well.

Every kid would not want to spend there day cleaning the community, they would rather stay at home and do nothing, but not all kids are like that. Those other kids would rather help out our community than have litter everywhere an live in a garbage dump. I think it would be better if kids did help out an clean because it will give them an opportunity to give back to the community an do something right for a change. Kids who do get into trouble, this can help them to stay out of all that trouble. Cleaning up will also look good for the community, it will look more attracting and would make people want to go there. It would also help with the pollution.

Telling kids at a young age to pick up trash can help prevent this. Even though kids would rather not do community service, I think it would be good for them. Doing so, this would help the kids stay out of trouble and keep people knowing that they live in a clean community an we still have some kids helping out the community.",0
"I don't know if you know know who I am but, I am Luke Bomberger. I have been on a ship for many years now. You should ride a cattle-boat too. A cattle-boat is a boat that carries animals across sea. When I was younger I helped my aunt Katie with her farm, that helped me prepare for the dangers that life holds.

Even though there are dangers at sea, I still like it. I am very happy while I am on this boat. It is an opportunity of a lifetime. ""I am grateful for the opportunity."" I said back in the 1900s. I was told by a captain to keep doing cattle-boating for my service. Your friends could help you become a cattle-boater. My friend helped me. By participating in cattle-boat, you could learn about other people and their needs. You could also learn about more cultures.

You may not think this a great ""job"" in all but actually, it kind of is. You do not know what is going to come at you. It's like a total suprise! You could be the driver of the boat, you could watch over the animals like me, you could do all sorts of things! We'll make sure you get fed. Who knows maybe you could even end up being the captain of the ship. That would be cool considering you just got here. You may think this is a joke but it's actually not.

There are a lot of men and women on this ship with the animals. You could be one of them, and who knows, maybe you'll try it and like it as much as me. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" When my friend asked me to go with him, I couldn't say no because I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Maybe you will have one of your friends come up to you an ask you to go to another country with them and away from your family. Maybe, you'll even say yes.

If you do go anywhere, tell me and I'll give you all the hints I know. Be careful though, the sea is dangerous. There have been a few ship-wrecks here and there. But not for a while. You are going to need a couple essentials: blankets, pillows, extra clothes, food, water, shoes and that is pretty much all you need for this boat ride. Have a good time! ",0
"Receiving or giving advice can be helpful in many different ways, especially from someone you trust. Usually when people ask for advice they are stuck, confused, or would like to talk to someone that has experience on what they need advice from. Advice should come from the heart. Just think about when someone has ever gave you advice or when you're in the moment of. You want someone to take you serious, and understand you.

Depending on how comfortable you are on what you need advice for, talking to multiple people may vary. However, from experience, getting opinions from more than one person can get confusing and here is why. One person may not understand, or even willing to help you with your decision. On the other hand others will cope, understand, and share their experience as well. Although, in experience receiving advice from more than one person has helped me a lot. You have to choose the right person to go to which is important. Not everyone can talk to just anyone, some people even get therapists or have guidance counselors! Therapists are more in the use of if you're going through something in your personal life and finding ways to get over it, or cope with.

In previous experiences I have been told, asking for advice is ""embarrassing"" to some people. I find that no where near embarrassing because you should not feel that way at all. You need to be comfortable at all times and always listen to what the other person has to say. Here are a couple small questions people ask for advice on just as little as these!

Getting a cat or a dog

Dealing with friendships or relationships

How to deal and cope with such things.

When you ask multiple people even with these three examples it gives a better perspective on your decision. If you're planning on ending a friendship but don't know how, I advise you to ask multiple people. As I stated earlier in the passage, asking multiple with help you choose your decision by listening to their previous experiences and even mistakes they have made if they have such in the process. Other peoples point of views will make you learn, and think about what you will decide on. What I mean by learning, is that when someone shares their advise you can learn by their choices and in future references by someone asking you for that same advice. In some cases, not everyone listens to someone else's advise and can completely ignore it. Which isn't a big deal because you never know. Some people even stick to their gut and don't ask for advise which can be smart.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions from more than one person can really help in various ways as stated above. You get more options to think about, and you learn from either their mistakes, what to do in future cases and in the back of your head, you will know whats best for you in the end.",0
" Should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day? I believe that the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. This additional time would have a positive impact on both students and teachers.

Firstly, students would benefit greatly from having more time to study and learn with their teachers. By providing them with more time, students would be able to focus on their work and not feel rushed. For example, when Generic\_Name was 10 years old in Generic\_City, he found school to be unenjoyable because it ran from 7am to 4pm. The teachers would force him to do homework, classwork, and other learning activities, which he found to be overwhelming. However, despite his initial dislike for school, he learned a lot from his teachers and still remembers their teachings today. By providing students with more time to learn, they will be better equipped to understand and retain the information being taught.

Secondly, teachers would also benefit from having more time to teach their students. By providing them with more time, teachers would be able to slow down and explain concepts more clearly, without feeling rushed. For example, when I was in school in Generic\_City, I found that my classes were often too short, and I would not have enough time to finish my work. This would lead to me rushing through my work, which would ultimately result in lower grades. By providing teachers with more time, they would be able to better support their students and help them achieve their full potential.

In conclusion, I believe that the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. This additional time would have a positive impact on both students and teachers, and would ultimately lead to better learning outcomes. By providing students with more time to learn and teachers with more time to teach, we can create a more supportive and effective learning environment.",1
"Do you like participating in extracurricular activity because I don't? I disagree with my principals decision of making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. There are a few reasons I don't like participating in school activates and I can name a few of those reasons. One reason is that I want to spend time with my family instead of doing school activities, another reason is that i can tend to be shy, and I'm really lazy.

I like spending time with my family. Me and my family will sometimes go to Generic_City, or even just to the park. If I participated in school activities me and my family wouldn't be able to go places. I really enjoy spending time with my family because I dont get to see them much during the week so on the weekends we will go somewhere to do something. It could be something little or it could be something big I love my family and if I were to participate in school activities we would have games on the weekend preventing me from spending time with my family.

Another reason I don't like school activities is because I'm very shy and just act weird during events. If I wasn't so shy I would participate in school activities. Due to being shy prevents me from making friends and when you make friends it can make the activity more funner than it already is. Shy can also be a good thing at times during schools activities because you won't be spotted out as much as the more talkative kids. So yeah I'm a very shy person but being shy can sometimes be a good thing.

My last topic about not liking to participate in school activity is that I'm very lazy. I usually during the week after school go home watch a little bit of T.V and then do my laundry and then sit there and do nothing.

I hate having to do something especially on the weekends after a long week of school I just want to lay down and do nothing. Every once in awhile I'll go outside and shoot some basketball but other than that I dont do anything. So I'm a very lazy person and don't want to do many things around the house.

In conclusion I disagree with my principals decision of making all students at least participate in one school activity. I like spending time with my family. I am very shy and don't like to participate for that reason. I'm lazy and don't do anything but do laundry and shoot basketball. So yeah I disagree with the principal decision of at least all students participate in a extracurricular activity. ",0
"Dear Principle,

I don't think that you should require every student to do community service.

I think this because everybody should be able to do what they want.

They could volunteer to do it, but you shouldn't make them do it.

It would be a good idea to start a little club or something of that sort to do community service.

Or you could put up a list in the office or right outside of the office for people to participate in doing community service.

I don't think everybody should have to do it cause when they are not in school some have things to do like sports and other sorts of clubs.

You could also get a class that people could be in to do community service as a class so people could put on job applications and college applications too.

A class would also be good for tutoring the elementary, so they wouldn't have to stay after school.

Most student probably wouldn't be able to do that.",0
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during their break. With students having a project to do during their break, it might help them not lose knowledge of what they have learned over the school year. One problem is that with the project being designed by the teacher students might not have motivation or be willing to do the project, or if the project that has been designed by the teacher is not interesting the students might not be willing to do the assignment. With the schools having students require to do summer projects during their break, the project should be student designed, not by teachers.

First, letting students design their own projects will give them the opportunity to do something that interests them. Therefore, this will make the students want to be able to their project and in the process of making it, they might find it fun to do. With the students being able to design their project and finding something that interests them it will make them put more effort into the project. Most importantly this will keep them learning throughout their break and more eager to do their projects.

Additionally, throughout the school year teachers have designed tests, quizzes, and projects to students but unfortunately there are some who tends to find it boring and not do it. But with letting them choose what they want to do for their project, this project could help with their grade. The students putting effort and time into their own choice of what they want to do might make that task easier for them. Then after they have done their project knowing that they put effort into what they are doing, they will have the satisfaction of completing it than just not doing it because the project designed by the teacher doesn,t interest them.

Some may say, that students shouldn,t be able to design their own project and let the teacher do it because thats how it should be. However, that has been the problem of education and why some students fail their classes because they aren,t given the option of what they want to do or how they want to do it. Students have their own way of learning. But the best way for them is them exploring on their own, finding their own interests of how they want to do their assignments. Sometimes students learn by comparing things of what they like to what they have to do to complete their task.

In conclusion, schools are making students complete projects during their summer break to assure that they are still continuing to learn. Making the students design their own projects will make them be more interested to what they are doing and put more time and effort. With doing the best they can their grades could be higher and help them out in the long run. For so long all year students are forced to do tasks that are designed by teachers and most of the time the task that is assigned to them is not intriguing for the students which leads them to not doing their project. So if teachers want better results and more effort into projects, projects should be designed by students and not by teachers.            ",0
"In this article it talks about the face of Mon Lisa. Many of people have wondered and thought what Mona was feeling or was trying to express. Will now they came out with a new software were it recgonizes and tell the experssions of ones face. To me I don't like the idea of the software, it can be subatage to someones art. In parapgraph one in the beginning of the sentnce it gives you bunch of facial expressions that Mona is giving. The software indicates several expressions that she is making. In paragraph 3 says when the process begins, the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. They recognize the the muscles and what the face is expressing.

To me this software of a cheat cheat to art. Art is meant to be looked at, to be studied and to make you more intrested in the art. You can have a millions of questions about an art piece the cool thing about the Mona Lisa is that it is a very famous painting, why because it was unique, people wondering for many years to see if she is smiling or no or what she's is expressing. in paragraph 5 says,""We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Which is a good thing becuase we learn more about the face and how they make it with expressions.

A software shouldn't be able to tell what they're expressing it just makes you not observe the photo anymore as much, because now that they may know what she's expressing she won't have the much popular attention to it like it did before. Says in paragraph 6,""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows how much this computer can do."" Really it even says imagine a computer knowing when your happy or sad, to me thats just invasion to a person, you can always tell you how you are feeling and many just decide to keep them to themselves.

Many people have their way of expressing themselves and sometimes you can be curious of how they're feeling. Which is good because the more you look at something you study it and you put piece and piece together until you solve it. Look at pragraph 7, it gives you something to do while your looking in the mirror, to make a face expression, and the face they told you to make was smiling. It's showing how easily you can describe someone face just by describing the face and the muscle form. It's not always good for everyone to know what you're face is expressing because thats just dull. It's not important for people to know, which will just make you more curious of you. Just as long as you know what your feeling, and thats what I think the artist that did this painting was trying to achieve.

This is my opinion on the software. I think that it is useless. It really is something that is happening now in this world is that technology is taking over us and what we do. We barley use our brains to study or read over something because we use the internet for that. We don't play outside or even try to look at new things in the world because were distacted by our phones or the tv. Most people are barley active and decide just to lay around and look at a screen. Now this is another thing less for a person to worry about, and slowly things that we are capable of doing by ourselves and using our head wouldn't be neccary because there's a sofware to that for us. Artist express themselves in art and they want people to figure it out and admire their painting, not a software to tell us. We become intelligent more each day if we use our head and take time to think about and thats something that is good for the people.    ",0
"Have you ever thought about what life would be like on Venus? Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star"", is said to be a challenge when it comes to exploring. The author develops a main point that Venus is a fasinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped.

First of all, Venus, also known to be Earths ""twin"", is a mystery. The author tells the readers about what past explorations have been like and why no one is living or has traveled to Venus in almost three decades. """"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."". The author also tells of why no space craft has been able to survive the landing on Venus. ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."". However that does not stop scientist from trying to create more explorations to gain more research.

In addition to the surface being inhospitable, that does not stop scientist from planning more explorations to gain more research. The author asks us, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface?"". Well we are told that, ""Today Venus still has some features that are analogous tgo thoses on Earth."". Which tells us that even scientist are still figuring out how Earth became Earth, and if Venus was just like Earth. Which leads to more research and more information.

Finally, we are told about how a-like Earth and Venus are through the research of the scientists. Which scientist believe we should not stop our travels just because of dangers. In paragraph 8 the author states, "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". This shows that the author does not believe that the danger should hold us back and stop us from exploring. In the same paragraph it also states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

Over all, the author develops a main point that Venus is a fasinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped. By showing the readers that there is more than what meets the eye when talking about Venus. Also that one should never let danger stop them from exploring.",0
"Cellphones

People should not use their phones while driving because it is a huge safety hazard with many deadly consequences. Another reason, it puts the people that don't have car insurance at risk as well. People in America fall to realize the amount of damage they do when doing something so dangerous to ourselves and to other people. People who don't care about their own lives would do an action like this.

It's basically a safety hazard when it comes don't to situations like this. For example in 2019 there were over 55,000 accidents over the country every day and it's because a person is on his or her phone. Events like this puts people in America in panic, especially new drivers. Also another fact actions like this as increases the death rate in America which makes the country look bad. Then it also uses a lot of our resources to repair the damage to the car or for the factory to make more cars.

Car accidents are expensive to not just the people but also to their car insurance. Being in a car accident can affect your money which isn't a good if you're the type of person that having a hard time in life. People don't think about the consequences just by texting and driving. That person that caused the accident just by taking his eyes off the road could take a life or ruin someone's life. I believe that people don't need phones while their driving unless it's being used for good reason, like for example the GPS. Anything else shouldn't be allowed to protect the people and keep our taxes from going up because of these rates.                  ",0
"Do you think computers being able to tell students emotions be useful? I say it could be useful it could tell us if the student is bored which that could help us try to make the student more intrested in what he is about to learn. This could also tell us if anyone it feeling hurt or depressed because of something that happened to them which we could probably help the student with the problem they have. It could tell us if the student is slacking off or if the student needs extra help.

This would be useful to help students stay active and be intrested in what they are going to learn. It would tell us if the student is bored and that could help us find another way to make the kid more intrested in what we are learning. It would also tell us if the kid was slacking off which if a kid was slacking off we could move him and let him be more comforable where he could be more intrested and pay attention to the things he is about to learn. We would be able to help out your child many peoples children we could help them get on track and maybe help them get a scholarship and give them a better understanding of school and education. Would you want your childs emotions read by a computer?

Imagine if your child was going through something that happened to him theses computers could help us figure what is wrong with your child. And maybe that is the problem why he is not paying attention we could help so many children by this. We could lead and help students to success. If your child is failing in school it might be because of being bored which these computers would tell us and we c oulc find another way to help your child so he wouldn't be failing.

We need to let people know that this could solve so many problems. If your child new something bad was going to happen or knew a student was getting bullied or he was getting bullied we could find that out with the computer and help them out. We could help kids from harming themselfs just think about how many kids we could save. Do you wish you had these computers when you were younger? i say yes this ould have helped me do better in school and it could have told my teachers that i needed extra help.

Just think about how many kids could be succesful because of theses computers. Think about how it could help you out if you were to be able to have theses computers when you were in school?   ",0
"I am against the continued operation of zoos. The main reason for this is that they are not effective in conserving animals and their habitats. Many animals in zoos are taken from the wild, which can harm the populations of those species. Additionally, the living conditions in zoos often do not mimic the natural habitats of the animals, causing them stress and health issues.

Furthermore, zoos do not provide adequate education about conservation. While some zoos have educational programs, they often focus more on entertainment than on teaching visitors about the importance of preserving wildlife and their habitats. This can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the natural world.

There are better alternatives to zoos for both conservation and education. Wildlife reserves and national parks allow animals to live in their natural habitats while also providing opportunities for people to learn about them. Additionally, technology such as virtual reality can provide immersive educational experiences without harming animals.

In conclusion, the negative impacts of zoos on animal conservation and the lack of effective education they provide make them an outdated and unnecessary institution. It is time to phase out zoos and focus on more ethical and effective ways to protect and educate about wildlife.",1
"hey guys this is tyler, i'm a reporter, today i'm going to give you three reasons why it's a challenge to explore venus.

- my first reason is because venus is a very very hot plant if you so much as enter the plant, the atmosphere it will crush you do to the tempature and the extreme conditions on the plant.

- my second reason it has been claimed that it is more dangerous to see up close.

it's the second planet away from the sun but it is also considered our planet, earth's, ""twin"" among other things the reason why it's considered our second planet is for density and size also distance.

- my final reason it's thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus for a even more challenge the clouds have a high corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. the pressure is 90 times greater than what we exprience on our own planet. the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on earth.

i'm going to end this report, thanks for reading and i hope you enjoyed it.

thank you:)",0
"The Seagoing Cowboys Program

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a very nice thing in many ways. You will have lots of opportunitys to do things that you have never done in your life. The reasons that I know you should join this program is you get to take care of animals,have fun playing games on board with other cowboys,you get to ride the waves all the time on a boat, and going new places to see other things and cultures.

The first reason you should join this program is you get to take care of overseas animals. Luke said you get to take care of horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Helping animals is very fun and animals might be very cute to you so this is a big advantage to joining this program. You will start to build a relationship with the animals and start to love them in a way you cant imagine.

The second reason you should join this Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to have fun on board with other cowboys. Cowboys on board like Luke get to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Other games that cowboys play to pass time is tabble-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

The third reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get to ride the waves on a boat to see the sea. Lots of people love seeing the ocean and riding on it,but this way you just have to join the program and you can ride the seas as much as you like. The ocean is soothing and is just so peaceful compared to the city where it is very load and annoying.

The fourth and most important reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to discover new places and sightseeing. Going to Greece, Europe, China, and many other places seems really fun for seeing new cultures,how people dress, and the landforms. Its good to explore something new and go around the world in this program.

In conclusion,I think the Seagoing Cowboys program is one of the best programs of all time. You get to explore,take care of animals,and have lots of fun with friends. I hope you take this message massivly that joining this program will change the way you think about life today.        ",0
"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay about individuality! 😃

So, you know, individuality is like, super important because it allows people to be themselves and not just follow the crowd. Like, have you ever seen those memes where people are all dressed the same and they're all standing in a line? 😂 It's like, totally lame!

But seriously, individuality leads to the greatest accomplishments because it allows people to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. Like, if everyone was the same, we wouldn't have things like, you know, the internet! 💻 It was invented by a dude named Tim Berners-Lee, and he's like, a total genius for thinking of something so cool!

Another example is like, art. If everyone was the same, we wouldn't have all the different styles and genres of art. Like, have you seen the Mona Lisa? 🎨 It's like, totally mind-blowing! And it's because the artist, Leonardo da Vinci, was able to express himself in his own unique way.

And it's not just about creativity, individuality also leads to diversity, which is like, totally important. Like, if everyone was the same, the world would be so boring! 🙅‍♀️ We'd all be speaking the same language, eating the same food, and listening to the same music. Yawn!

But with individuality, we get to experience all these different cultures and ways of life. Like, have you tried sushi? 🍣 It's like, totally delicious! And it's because of individuality that we're able to enjoy all these different foods and traditions.

So, in conclusion, individuality is like, super important for creating new ideas, expressing ourselves, and experiencing diversity. It's what makes the world a more interesting and exciting place! 🌎🎉

And that's my essay! I hope you liked it! 😃 Let me know if you have any questions or if you want me to explain anything",1
" I agree with the prompt that change is possible, even if it seems impossible for some people. However, I believe that the key to change lies in our ability to recognize and address the root causes of the problems we face.

It is easy to get caught up in the symptoms of a problem and feel overwhelmed by them, but we must remember that the root cause of the problem is what truly needs to be addressed. For example, global warming is a symptom of our reliance on fossil fuels and unsustainable practices. In order to truly address global warming, we must first recognize the root cause and make changes to our behavior and practices to reduce our carbon footprint.

It is also important to recognize that change is not something that happens overnight. It takes time, effort, and persistence to make lasting changes. We must be willing to put in the work to make a difference, even when it is difficult or uncomfortable.

Furthermore, we must also recognize that change is not something that happens in isolation. It takes the collective efforts of individuals, communities, and even nations to make a significant impact. We must work together to create a better future for ourselves and future generations.

In conclusion, while change may seem impossible at times, I believe that it is possible if we are willing to recognize and address the root causes of the problems we face, put in the work to make a difference, and work together to create a better future.",1
"Homework, huh? I know, rite? Its like, why do we need it? I mean, I get it, like, it helps us, like, learn and stuff, but, like, sometimes it just feels like, too much, you know? Like, we gotta do it every night, and its just, like, sooo stressful.

I think homework is, like, kinda pointless, you know? We, like, just do it, and then we, like, forget about it, and then we have to, like, relearn it all over again in class. It's just, like, why bother, you know?

But, like, on the other hand, I guess it does help us, like, practice and stuff. And, like, if we don't do it, we might, like, fall behind and stuff. But, like, I think we should just, like, have a choice, you know? Like, if we wanna do it, we can, but if we don't wanna do it, we don't hafta. That way, we can, like, focus on other things, like, extracurriculars and stuff.

And, like, I know some people are, like, really good at homework and stuff, and they, like, enjoy it, but for people like me, its just, like, too hard and stressful. I mean, I'm not, like, a bad student or anything, but homework is just, like, not my thing, you know?

So, in conclusion, I think homework is, like, kinda pointless, but at the same time, it does, like, help us practice and stuff. But, like, I think we should just, like, have a choice, you know? That way, we can, like, decide for ourselves if we wanna do it or not.

"Not everyone has the luxury of owning a car. But cars are not the only means that can get us from point A to point B. In fact, having limited usage of cars is an advantage to society, our own good, and also the environment. In the twentyfirst century, it may seem that possessing a car is a vital aspect of living, however, that is not always the case.

To began with, having a limited amount of cars on the roads means a less amount of car emission that stays in the air. Carbon emissions from cars are responsible from around 50% of the greenhouse gases in the United States alone Source 1. If we were to limit our car usage, it is very likely for that percentage to go down. Taking the account that cars are the second most item that pollutes the air, it would be a dramatic change for the environment to be a cleaner and heathier place to live Source 4.

Additionally, if we were to use our cars less and relied on public transportation, we would be able to help the economy. Using individual cars does not help anyone economically. In the other had, riding subways, buses, taxis, and other public transportation will allow the public economy to rise, which in turn allows the government to receive extra money that could benefit the local city. Taking the decision to not use cars promotes alternative ways to get to the final destination in mind Source 3. It also lets parks to be used more often than before and sidewalks become wider and safer. Moreover, the less cars that are on the street, the less traffic jams, car crashes, and time that is wasted sitting in a car wishing to be somewhere else Source 3.

furthermore, if more people were to walk or bike on the side walks, they would be able to enjoy the natural nature that they cannot fully appreciate when they are zooming pass it in their cars at fifty miles per hour. Also, getting the chance to actaully look at what the local city has to offer helps little businesses to become successful. Not using cars can also be included in our daily excersise that we are all supposed to be doing. Instead of being lazy and using cars to take us to places, we can all use that extra mile or so to help improve our health. Getting out in the open and getting some fresh air will also be beneficial to one's health by alleviating them from bad thoughts and ""it is a good opportunity to take away stress"" Source 3. Getting away from the busy life that includes cars is extremely advantageous to humans' health and the city they live in.

Much has changed throughout history. Nothing ever stays the same, so maybe it's the time to change the amount of car usage. This era is a time period where there are many technological inovations that allow humans from all across the world to stay in touch without leaving their couch. There has been a noticeable decrease in the amount of miles that have been driven since 2005 Source 4. This is a positive step foward to a better future for the generations to come for less cars on the road means there wil be less pollutions entering the atomsphere, more opportunities for businesses, and incouraging individuals to make healthier choices.",0
"If I was to receive work for the summer break I would rather it be student designed work and not teacher designed work for many reasons. Theres the fact that if my work was designed by a student someone with a similar mindset as my own I would be able to understand it more clearly than if it was designed by a teacher. Plus theres the fact that student designed work has a possibility of being more simplistic, although teacher designed work is good for challenging the mind and stimulating brain cells im sure students would much rather enjoy there break much sooner. For example if your teacher gave you the choice to have the person to your left choose your summer project for you or have a five page essay on a prompt she gave you which one would you rather do not that hard of a choice is it.

One of the main reasons why I prefer work made by students over work made by teachers is because its easier to comprehend for those who have a harder time understanding more than others. With students making the work It would challenging without being to difficult to the point were it would consume a large amount of time to complete and not anytime to do anything during summer break. Unlike if you got an Teacher assigned project which could have the possibility to consume a large amount of time to complete. Like for example: if hypotheticaly speaking if the person to your left only give an assignment to write one to two paragraphs about a entire country and there culture or get an a your teacher gives you to write a four to five page essay about the history of schoool and how it started.

If I were to have a choice between simple work and complex work I would choose simple almost everytime because of one main reason is it takes less time to do. With the student designed work you would finish faster allowing you to have more free time to enjoy your summer break and relax away from school. Theres also the added benefit of getting more simple work done in a short time frame than you would complex work. I conclude this by saying that it would be more logical to have students design there own work for the summer break rather than have a teacher assign them some work for the summer break.",0
" It's easy to get caught up in the idea of setting high goals and striving for them, but sometimes the real danger lies in setting our sights too low and settling for mediocrity. It's not always easy to tell others what we truly want because we fear they may not want the best for us or may try to sabotage our efforts. We may also be afraid of failure or rejection, so we choose to aim lower in order to avoid disappointment.

One example of this can be seen in our daily habits and routines. We may want to exercise more or eat healthier, but we often find ourselves making excuses or giving in to distractions, such as our phones. We may also put off important tasks, such as homework or studying, in favor of more enjoyable activities. This can lead to a lack of progress and a feeling of failure, even when we have the best intentions.

Another example of setting our sights too low can be seen in our New Year's resolutions. We may make promises to ourselves to lose weight, quit smoking, or improve our grades, but we often fail to follow through on these promises. This can be due to a lack of motivation, fear of failure, or simply not putting in the effort. When we set our sights too low, we may also be more likely to give up when faced with obstacles or setbacks.

It's important to remember that the things we do are ultimately for our own benefit, and we should not be swayed by the opinions or actions of others. While it's natural to want the approval and support of our friends and family, we should not let their opinions dictate our choices or actions. We should strive to do what is best for us, even if it means going against the expectations of others.

In conclusion, setting our sights too low can be just as dangerous as setting them too high. We should be mindful of our habits and routines, and strive to set realistic and achievable goals for ourselves. We should also remember that the things we do are ultimately for our own benefit, and we should not be swayed by the opinions or actions of others. By focusing on our own progress and growth, we can achieve our full potential and live a fulfilling life.",1
"My dream job was to become a scientist. I finally accomplished my goal, but it was a lot of hard work. Being a scientist is not an easy job! I had learned about ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" and now i have to interview with Mrs. Sally Backbone because she thinks the face was created by aliens when I beg to differ!

Ms. Breadwill here to do an interview with Mrs. Backbone, because she thinks ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" was made by aliens. I've did some research and i have all the answers to your questions Mrs. Backbone. Let's Get Started! "" Few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact and i think they are right"" said Mrs. Backbone. "" Well your certainly not wrong Mrs. Backbone, but cheif Jim Garvin told us "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it, plus what about in the years of 1998 and 2001."" replied Ms. Breadwill. I immedeitly showed Mrs. Backbone the photos that were taken in the year of 1998 and in the year of 2001 and she was speechless.

Mrs. Backbone had another question for Ms. Breadwill (me). I told Mrs. Backbone to let all the questions she needed to answer be said. Mrs. Backbone told me that The Face on Mars was located at 48 degrees south martain latitude. Ms. Breadwill shook her head and replied "" Your wrong, because the scientists and I studied and found out that The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude."" Mrs. Backbone was once again speachless and i think i seen her roll her eyes. "" Mrs. Backbone how are you feeling?"" Ms. Breadwill commented. Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?""

Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all her questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told her she was wrong once again. She yelled "" How?!"" I simpliy told her On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I also told her on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view."" She asked me ''Was that all?'' Ms. Breadwill told Mrs. Backbone one last thing and it was "" What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Mrs. Backbone had all her questions answered, so I believe that my work here is done!

I am Ms. Breadwill,and I am a scientist at NASA. If you need questions answered about the Face on Mars, then I am the one to help you. I will answer all your questions whether they are easy or very difficult. I believe I am the best scientist in all America.",0
"Seagoing Cowboys Program is a program, where you take care of horses, calfs (young cows), and mules, that were shipped over sea. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to travel to a lot of unquine countries around the world. Luke Bomberger was a Seagoing Cowboy and, by the time it was 1947 he made nine trips. Luke's second trip was that he had to serve as a night watchman, who checks on the animals every hour.

We know now that, not everyone would like to be a Seagoing Cowboy, but while you are traveling, there are many new countries you could explore and learn about. It does take a long time to get to other countries, it would take about two weeks because they have to travel in boat, if your going by sea. It would be a tedious amount of time to get to place to place and nobody likes a tedious task. Luke had to make sure that he didn't forget to feed the animals because,you have to feed them two or three times a day. They had to get loads of bales of hay and bags of oats from other ships that transfer the food to him, and you would have to clean the stalls. Some don't about joining this program is that, when you are traveling you, may get stuck in some storms and really hurtful storms too.

Although, there is a lot of traveling, it maybe worth the work because, you got to see new countrires and new landscapes. Luke Bombgerger worked hard and he loved seeing all the new cities and countries, but struggles traveling. There is many up and downs about joining the program, literally, because not everyone likes traveling, but a lot of people do. Now we have airplanes so, if you travel it will be easier for you to get to other countries. In the end, it is going to be easier for you to travel, now that we have airplanes, but you should join Seagoing Cowboys.",0
"Taking community service can help you and your community. It makes you become a better person overall. Friends who think community service is unimportant should have to take community service for 7 weeks each summer.

Students should be required to take community service, because it help you learn how to treat others and also help you gain your self confidence. You shouldn't do community service just, because your parents force you to you should do it to help people out around you and your community. Community service can lead you long ways in life. It can lead into success in your business that you work in. Community service should not take to much time if it does you should still waste you time and have fun with it.

"Dear Principal,

I heard about your new requirements on community service and students in our school performing community service. I just wanted to give you my opinion on your expectation and I think it isn't a very good idea for it to be mandatory to perform community service. It gives less opportunities for students to succeed in their goals, and it takes out our free time which gives us time to have fun and learn new things. This situation should be handled wisely.

If students act on doing community service, they will have less opportunities to succeed in their goals. For example, if a student wanted to learn how to play an instrument, they wouldn't be able to learn it because there would be no time for lessons. They would have to be doing community service which would take away the opportunity to learn. They also have many other responsibilities besides community service such as taking care of a younger sibling, focusing on school and education, house chores, and many others. Community service would be another responsibility that a child would have to take on and which maybe not even be prepared for.

Community service would take out students free time to have fun and learn new things. Students wouldn't be able to have fun and enjoy their lives if they are stuck doing community service. They wouldn't have social time to hang out with their friends. They wouldn't even have time to be with their family as much. Children would be very miserable and would be very depressed at a young age. They wouldn't have to much of a great memory as a child either.

Community service isn't a very good thing to make students perform at an early age. It takes away time and opportunities and gives too much responsibility to students. Students should be able to enjoy their childhood and not remember it as cleaning up litter. I don't think you wanted to remember your childhood as a community service worker. I hope you take my opinion into consideration and reconsider yours as well.

Sincerely, 8th Grade student,                        ",0
"Cell phones we all have them and everyone knows we do. We take to school when we know we should not. The school policy I believe we should have is policy 2. There are many reasons why we should not bring our cell phones the distract students and no one really knows who we could be texting or what we are texting.

One of the reasons we should not have our cell phones is because we could be distracting someone such as a teacher even though we could only use our phones during our free time we could be texting someone in a class room who is learning and trying to focus on the lesson but they can not because some one is texting them.

Another reason we should not have cell phones is because of texting. Texting yes we could text on our free time but what if I have friend who is in Math class while i have free time and suppose that my friend is taking a test today and she asked me if I could text her the answers would it be another form of cheating and cheating on a test is big it would not be right to allow us to bring cell phones when we are going to use them to cheat on our tests.

These are just some of the reasons why we should not allow cell phone to school even if it is during our free time. There are consequents when we bring our cell phones to school these phones are useful but out side of school but at school what we need them for nothing but distract student from there work.",0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student in response to the prompt:

Setting a good example is a powerful way to influence others, but is it more effective than authoritarian and traditional methods? In my opinion, setting a good example is the better choice because it promotes a more positive and respectful environment.

When someone sets a good example, they are showing others how to behave and act in a certain way. For instance, if a teacher is kind and patient with their students, the students are more likely to be kind and patient with each other. This creates a positive atmosphere in the classroom and encourages good behavior. On the other hand, if a teacher is strict and demanding, it can create a fearful environment where students are more likely to act out or disrupt the class.

Another reason why setting a good example is more effective is that it builds trust and respect. When someone sees that you are genuine and authentic, they are more likely to listen to what you have to say and follow your lead. For example, if a coach is fair and honest with their players, they are more likely to be respected and listened to when they give instructions or advice.

In contrast, authoritarian and traditional methods can be seen as oppressive and controlling. When someone is bossy or demanding, it can create a power imbalance and lead to resentment. For instance, if a parent is always yelling and punishing their child, the child may feel scared and resentful, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.

Furthermore, setting a good example can be more effective in the long run. When someone sees that their actions have consequences and that they can make a positive impact, they are more likely to be motivated to change. For example, if a friend sees that their actions are hurting someone they care about, they may be more likely to change their behavior to avoid hurting them again.

In conclusion, setting a good example is a more effective way to influence others than authoritarian and traditional methods. It promotes a positive and respectful environment, builds trust and respect, and can be more effective in the long run. So, the next time you want to influence someone, try setting a good example instead of using authoritarian or traditional methods",1
" The debate surrounding the extension of school days by one and a half hours is a complex one, with many arguments for and against. While some may argue that the benefits of a longer school day outweigh the potential drawbacks, I believe that the current school schedule is sufficient and that any changes could have negative consequences for students, teachers, and the school as a whole.

On the surface, the idea of adding more time to the school day may seem appealing. More time could allow for more electives, more opportunities for learning, and potentially even more time for socializing. However, it's important to consider the potential impact of such a change on the students, teachers, and the school as a whole.

Firstly, students may find a longer school day to be overwhelming and unmanageable. If students are already struggling to keep up with their workload, adding more time to the school day could exacerbate these struggles. Students may also find it difficult to balance their academic and social lives, as they may have less time for extracurricular activities and other pursuits outside of school.

Additionally, teachers may find it challenging to accommodate a longer school day. They may already be struggling to keep up with their workload, and adding more time to the school day could make it even more difficult for them to manage their teaching responsibilities. Teachers may also find it challenging to maintain a high level of engagement with their students if they are already feeling overwhelmed.

Finally, the school as a whole may struggle to manage a longer school day. The school may need to hire additional staff to cover the increased hours, which could be costly. The school may also need to make significant changes to its infrastructure, such as building additional classrooms or expanding the cafeteria.

In conclusion, while the idea of extending the school day by one and a half hours may seem appealing, I believe that the current school schedule is sufficient. Any changes to the school day could have negative consequences for students, teachers, and the school as a whole. Instead of extending the school day, we should focus on finding ways to support students and teachers in their academic and social pursuits outside of school.",1
"Extracurricular activities are a fun way for students to be involved in something worthwhile after the school day is complete. They can be fun, challenging, and a great way to learn something new. Extracurricular activities are also a way to spend time with friends and to get active. I think every student should participate in one activity because of these reasons. I agree with the principal's decision to mandate that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

After school activities are a great opportunity for students to learn a new skill. For example, if a student was considering playing basketball for a couple of years, but never really got into it, his or her school might have a club that they could be a part of. This holds true for many other activities, such as painting and cooking, only to name a few.

A student could try out many different activities over the course of the year to try new things and find out what they enjoy and are good at. The teenage years are the time in a person's life that they should explore new activities to have fun and discover what their talents are.

Another positive quality of extracurricular activities is that they allow students to spend time with their friends. Friends with a common interest can go to an after school activity to spend time together and do something they all enjoy. Students can also share one of their hobbies with friends who are interested in trying it out. For example, a student's friend might express interest in coding, which that student does after school. The student can take his or her friend to the coding club, so the friend can test it out. The student can guide the friend through the activity, while still letting them explore it and try it out. Students also have a huge chance to meet new people who share a common interest with them. Extracurricular activities are great for strengthening old friendships and establishing new ones, as well.

Finally, extracurricular activities are a great way for students to get active. This may be physically, in the case of a sport like flag football or working out in the school's fitness room. However, it could also mean getting active in the school, like working on the yearbook or serving on the student council. Students can also help out their communities through extracurricular activities. One example is an environmental club that participates in cleanups for a park or their school, building gardens, and spreading awareness of climate change. Getting active in an activity also cuts down on time students spend at home on electronic devices. This generation of kids spends a lot of time on cellphones and playing video games, so after school activities are a way to make students' time after school well spent.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are a way for students to be a part of something outside of the regular school day that is fun and rewarding to them. The activities give them a chance to learn something new, spend time with friends, and to get active. Most schools have many activities for students to try, so their options are not very limited. Whether it's something they've been doing for years, or a new interest, these activities give students a place to display their skills. I think the principal has made the right decision by having each student participate in an extracurricular activity.",0
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College should be kept despite it's lack of giving people a chance to speak up. Although, the Electoral College is a ""non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.. it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential canidate you're actually voting for a state of electors."" Yes this may be true but, have you thought that they created the Electoral College to help citizens live better? What if, someone with no education comes to vote and chooses someone who wants to take away government funds away from school's? Wouldn't that affect us? In other words, you want to ruin school's life by taking away funds and it doesn't really have to be school it can be anything just beacuse, you had no idea who you were voting for? The Electoral College does allow us to vote, but they make sure we aren't choosing someone who can affect the United States drasticly.

""The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potiential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, knowing that their vote will have no effect but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.""(Source 3) Brings me back to one of my claims, yeah you do want to vote, but what if you don't have no education but you want to vote just for the hell of it? Without the Elecoral College your vote will count, as well as others and the group of senators won't be there to make sure you don't choose whomever and make a horrible decision. Although the Electoral College makes it seem like your vote won't count believe it or not, the Electoral College atually makes the most suitable decison for us, the people. Without the Electoral College, we'd have probably different world.. meaning they fix our choices dumb or not, they come together and they choose what's best for us whether we,the people have an effect on it or not.

Despite the fact, our voice may not be heard as loudly as the state of electors, we still have an impact, and without the Electoral College it may be a drastic impact. The Electoral College should be kept, and not changed into the most popular vote wins. You don't just vote once and hallieluja, there is a process and that's where the Electoral Colleg takes hand and make sure we choose someone mosly suitable. The Electoral College should be kept, it is very helpful despite it's cons...

"""Hello, I am Luke Bomberger, I have traveled across the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the pacific twice, I have helped people affected by World War II. I was part of the Seagoing Cowboys program and i am here today to encourage and convince you to Join this amazing program."" I said infront of quite a few people in the town hall.

""Why should we listen to what you have to say?"" said my enimie who ran his own program that did exactly what the Seagoing Cowboys did. His name was Jack Linington. He was walkiong on the stage questoning my program. I got furious but i held it in.

""You should have to listen to what I say because what I have to say is important and can help people around the world who have been affected from war."" i said back. ""So what, my program is way better than yours"" said Jack. At this point half of the audience was questoning my program and the other half was yelling at Jack to get out.

""How is yours better than mine we both do the same thing. Can't we just put this feud to an end?"" I asked.

"" No, people don't listen to him or let him convince you to join his program, instead join mine.""He protested.

"" Please Jack join my program and let us be friends not enimies"" i insisted.

Finally, he broke down and--"" Yes, yes i will, ill join your program"" i couldn't beleive it he acually wanted to be part of the program! The feeling was a rush i acually softend him and we became friends.

I talked some more and when everyone left they all took a packet. And Jack and I are now not only partners,l we are friends.                ",0
"I do think this could be helpful in many ways, and could help in many ways. It's crazy what some technology can do now days. I think this could be used in a lot of mental and health situations if people are wanting help. This could help the doctor with these problems. But if they start using this in schools and things like that it might not work out as well. Thats just because some kids may not want that or parents.

I don't think this would be very helpful in a classroom. I don't see how it would work and help the school out or anyhing. Unless they are trying to track kids mental and emotional health. And this program is proabably a lot of money to have on computers. Some schools they can spend their money on better things for the kids of the school. Personal I just don't think it could help schools unless they have the program and are using this program for learning perposes.

Yes some schools and collages will use this for learning topics and other things for the kids to learn off of. But other than schools then school the only people I could see having this is like doctors or hospitals. It would be cool in the future if this could turn into a thing for animals and we could see their emotional and mental health. We would be able to see what like dogs or cats are thiking if they are happy or sad.

But this could be bigger in the near future and maybe could help a lot of people. I just don't see how it could help with anything that much. But everything usally has a reason why it's made and it will be used by some people with certain jobs with stuff like this. The big thing on it is it really could help with people that have emotional problems or i guess mental problems too. Or if someone is depressed real bad or something like that.",0
"As a teenager myself, it is very hard to wake up early in the morning and attend school for 7 hours a day, not including extracaricular acivities. Taking even some of those classes online could benefit students ability to learn with a comfortable learning environment. Sitting in uncomfortable chairs and cold classrooms is not an ideal place to be for a long period of time-- so if students were offered more opprotunities to learn from their own bed, living room, or a coffee shop through a computer, their quality of learning would greatly improve. It would also allow them more independance; because it would be their responsilibilty to get their work done, but an inevidable threat to that is students not putting enough time into the class at home. Although online classes may not be as structured as attending them at school, students are able to work in an environment they are comfortable in, and become more independent due to the resonsibility involved.

Online classes would benefit student's comfort in their learning environment; allowing them to enjoy the experience more. Coming into school 5 days a week and learning 7 classes worth of information is straining to our developing brains, so being able to attend a few of those classes from our homes, a coffee shop, or even while on a vacation would benefit the process. I did an interview with one of my close friends, Generic_Name, whom takes online classes to find out more about the learning environment. ""I love it,"" she said, ""I can sit in my bed and do my english class, or I could put in a pair of earbuds and do it at Starbucks."" Online classes could enable students to choose where they want to work. While a noisey classroom with 30 other kids in it would usually be distracting, the students could decide where they wanted to participate in class that day. Comfort is a key factor in success at learning, and applying that information-- but being uncomfortable is also important. Without discomfort students don't have a good foundation for what to expect in the future, and that's why the learning curve of online classes helps students to develope independence.

Having the resonsibility of ""attending"" and participating in online class sessions is a lot to ask of some teenagers, but it can help them become more indepentent as well. Although online classes would allow more comfort, physically going into school, and sitting in a classroom with a teacher persuades students to do their work-- since there are little alternatives. People with that view could argue that going to school offers more structure for students who need it and don't have the motivation to do the work on their own. Towards the end of my interview with Generic_Name she mentioned that, ""It's hard not having a teacher to work with directly to help me, but I think it has made me a better writer, since I've been having to do a lot of my own writing."" Online classes make students become more independent and ready for their future jobs when they grow up. As many people graduate from high school, they have little knowledge of how college will go, so through these online classes students will, early on, have to adapt to getting their work done on time without the constant reminder of a physical teacher. Though online classes may not feel as structured as attending school, they allow children to gain independence and sense of what to expect in the future; because we won't always have the help we need whenever we need it.

Taking online classes in the comfort of your home or somewhere you feel safe could benefit the way children learn and apply new information, due to the environment they are recieveing the information in. When combined with comfort and new, difficult information, students are able to branch off and experience real world things. As we continue to develope technology, it's important to use it to our advantage and make sure kids not only get the education they need to be successful, but the experience of becoming less reliant on others, and more so on ourselves as well. ",0

"The future technologies are improving, and the driverless car becomes popular these days. People dream about driving without the driver; car of course, taxi, bus, train, and air plane. It can bring us convenience. A lot of companies already started working on their driverless vehicles project, it will take huge part of the market in the future.

Driverless car can lead our future technology. It seems useful and practical. However, everything has their pros and cons, so does driverless car. In my opinion, driverless car can't driving without the driver, but it can help drivers drive easily and safely. Here is my articles to support my opinion.

First, it can ruin people's job. A lot people make money from working in the transportation company, if driverless car gets popular, nobody will need a taxi driver or a bus driver anymore. Pilots of trains and planes will no longer needed as well. It is hard to get a job these days even if you graduate the decent college, the driverless car will make this worse.

Second, the sensors and auto systems can help the drivers to drive, but it can't control all process of driving. Sometimes the computer doesn't work properly as our desktops or laptops do, it can cause errors any time. Sometimes driving needs human's ability, especial it's a sudden situation.

Third, the problem of responsibility. For example, if your driverless car hits the person in front of you, it is ambiguous to figure out who has the responsible for the accident. The car company, and the customers will argue to blame each other.

Driverless car can bring convenience to us. It seems very helpful, but it also has obivous problems. People are improving technologies right now at this time as well. But the important thing is people should think more carefully of pros and cons of the future technologies rather than just chasing the benefit in front of them. ",0
"Dear principle,

I would rather prefer policy one, which is that cell phones can be allowed in school and you can use them in lunch time or other free times as long as you do not use them in class. Students think that they can just be cool and use their cell phones in class and hide them behind their books that they are reading. News flash for you kids out there that do that , you can get in a lot of trouble for doing that. The reason that they do not allow us to use cell phones during class is because you could text some one during a test that has already took that test and ask for the answers or if you are doing a review for a class.

By doing that you could get phones took away from school permanently. All because you didn't want to study, so you thought you could text someone and get the answers. If to many people did that then we could get them took away permanently from school and never be able to take them on campus. I do love to text and I am sure that most kids my age do. It is not abnormal to want to text all the time.

However whatever you want to send to someone on the phone can wait until after school. Or if you need to tell your parents something or ask them something, do not text them and ask or tell in the middle of class, just go to the office and ask if you can use their phone. I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school, but if we keep texting during class I could completely understand why we couldn't take them to school. Please principle do not take our phones out of school!",0
"Thinking about a future with self-driving cars make me think about shows and movies I would watch growing up. The fact that driverless car might be avaliable in the years soon to come get me really excited. For as long as I can remember, there has been films out about the future and they always seem to have some sort of driverless car or things similar to that. Since the late 1950's people where already starting to come up with concepts about self-driving cars.

My position on the whole driverless cars in the future is that I am pro self-driving cars. And, here are a few reasons why. The cars they plan on making in the future would use up half of the fuel today's cars use. Using less fuel will put us on the right path of working to reduce the use of fossil fuels , and help cut down on pollution as a whole.

Another reason why I am pro diverless car, is because self-driving cars have been tested to drive more than half a million miles without crashing, when compared to humans driving cars. They have also added many saftey feature to these type of cars. Like, sensors that can help prevent skids and rollovers. Overall, driverless cars while have many, many saftey feature to create safer roads.

Now, like anything else there is cons to the pro's i have just mentioned. One of them being that, they will just cost so much money, wway more than regular cars. Like wise, in some states there are laws put in place that will not even allow for such cars like self-driving cars to even be tested. Another thing that was brought up is, "" What if the driver gets boerd having to wait for their turn to drive?"". Meaning that, car prototypes have a feature that will drive for you but, you have to have your hands on the wheel and the car will swich over to the drive incase of the event ther is road work or acciedent. And, one of the most important things that was mentioned in the article is, ""what is the driver where to get in an accident while in a self-driving car?"", would the car manufactuer be at fault or the person in the driverless car. Cases like this will be hard to solve due to the many factor involved. All in all there are some negatives aspects to the self-driving car.

To reflect back on everything, having self-driving, or driverless car would be an amazing accoplishment for the human race. There are some cons and some pros to the whole situation, but for me, I am pro driverless cars. Think about all of the inventions that could come from the driverless car. This will open new doors of opportunity for the next generations, as well as this one. This could all impact the quality of life drastically. Everything we do will have an impact on the future. So, we should continue work on protypes to make the roads a better and a safer place.   ",0
"Dear, principal

I was just reading your paper on how students have to have a B average to play sports and be in activities around school. I understand how you want your students to be smart and to participate in school activities and i some what agree with you. If you want the sports players to have good grades then you should set up, a study hall type thing for the sports players so that they could work their way up to good grades and even for regular students , but if u just have people that have good grades chances are that you won't have a very good sports team in any sport, unless you get lucky and get someone with good grades that is a athlete. Also, i agree with the one where you have to have a B average to participate in the activities only if you have good grades, because a lot of kids would start doing better if they got a reward every week that they turned in their work and had straight A' s or B' s. I, also believe that everyone in the world should do their work and get straight B' s or even straight A' s, because it not hard as long as you apply yourself to get good grades.

Sincerely, A Student from School

P.S You should set up a activity for the student that do good.",0
"A ""car free"" community has many advantages. They will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. They will also help you save more money by not having to pay for a car, and if you do, you can park it in a garage for 40,000. This will also expand other transportation and will have a new sixyear federal transportation bill. There is no disadvantages for having a ""carfree"" community. Many countries and cities are participating in limiting car usage to make the air better and cleaner.

First, and most important, is that reducing cars also reduces the greenhouse gas emission. People that participate in this are most likely doing it to make the air we breath better. In some overpopulated cities, the amount of smog is crazy. After just one day without some cars, the amount of smog disappeared. London had the idea for evennumbered license plates to be banned to drive one day, even though some people still used their cars. So more than half the cars are still on the road, and it reduced smog so much, they didn't even need to ban the odd numbered cars. This is the most important reason why people are limiting car usage.

Next, if you live in a car free community, you will never have to pay for your car. You can sell it to make more money because you will never have to use it. This is much better than owning a car and having to park it in a garage for 40,000. If you ever need to take the bus, you will have the money. With the extra money you can buy a bike also. The stores will be walking distances, so there is no need for a car. I think this is a great idea for not only a better community, but it would help people socialize with neighbors and it saves money while doing it. After World War II, the cities would start reconstructing around the car, but now that is beggining to change in Vauban, Germany.

Last, the cities are trying to expand public transportation, such as taxis and buses. It would promote these and play a much larger role in a new sixyear federal transportation bill. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways by law and 20 percent have gone to other transportation. If the city bans cars, you can either walk, skate, bike, or ride the bus or taxi. In America, the amount of cars being bought and license plates being bought are decreasing since 1995. President Obama has an ambitious goal on which he unvieled last week and he wants to get rid of green house gas emissions.

In conclusion, I think you would agree that limiting car usage has its advantages. It reduces greenhouse gases and also smog. After one day, Paris was clear of gas and smog in the air. The gas gets caught under the atmosphere and is dangerous. Limiting car usage also will help you save money because you no longer will have a car to pay for. Also, it would boost other forms of transportation, such as buses and taxis. This is a great idea to limit cars.",0
"There is no way to know how someone is feeling unless you are them.

Many people pretend to be happy. If you have depression you are prone to act happy even if you are not happy. Happiness comes from love, yes many can tell when their friend is upset that´s because they are close to them and know how they act. But just because you think you know how someone feels doesn´t mean you really know.

If you have a disease or some type of physical trait many don´t have then you may look different then others. Every human is different in many ways. No one on earth has the same face unless you are a twin but then but then it still doesn´t justify the fact whether or not some one is happy. If you have downs syndrom you look happy all the time but that doesn´t mean you are.

A computer can not tell your emotions because a computer does not have emotions. just because your facial muscle structure is a certain way can not determin your mood. Many scientists say putting on a happy face can actually help your emotions grow and develop. If you always have a happy face on then you will usually always be happy, that is not true. The Mona Lisa is one of the worlds most nutorious pieces of art. The Mona Lisa is set apart from much art only because of one reason and that reason is the woman is smiling.

pieces of art from the 16th century until the early 20th century did not have smiling. I am not sure why many did not smile maybe it was easier to paint humans withouts smiles. No one for sure knows if that woman was actually smiling except the girl and Da Vinci himself. The world always wants to improve and make changes and but the world is different we all face different struggle sand have different emotions you cannot put a label on a person´s emotions.    ",0
"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to start thinking about what career path to pursue in high school. While there are many different careers to choose from, it is important to do research and gain information about specific careers to make an informed decision.

One way to do this is by visiting medical and mechanic workshops. These workshops can provide valuable information about the skills and knowledge required for specific careers. For example, a medical workshop could provide information about the different types of medical careers, such as becoming a doctor or a nurse. A mechanic workshop could provide information about the different types of jobs in the automotive industry, such as becoming a mechanic or an auto technician.

In addition to visiting workshops, it is important to research the specific courses that are required for the career path you are interested in pursuing. For example, if you are interested in becoming a doctor, you may need to take courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. If you are interested in becoming a mechanic, you may need to take courses in math, science, and automotive technology.

It is also important to explore how to best prepare yourself for the future. This may include taking extracurricular activities, such as volunteering or participating in clubs, to gain experience and build your resume. It may also include taking summer courses or internships to gain practical experience in your field of interest.

Ultimately, the key to enjoying the courses you take while achieving the best grades possible is to find a balance between academics and personal interests. It is important to find courses that you enjoy and are passionate about, but also to make sure that they will help you achieve your career goals. By doing research, visiting workshops, and exploring different courses and opportunities, you can make an informed decision about what career path to pursue in high school and set yourself up for success in the future.",1
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. This face has only come out once and we have not found any other faces planted on Cydonia, the region the face was located at. The face has been fading, There is no real proof of the face being kept there by aliens, and there was no alien momunment after all.

One reason is that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because the face has been fading. The text states that they have tooken pictures of this Face on Mars and both times they have the face becomes unnoitcable. For Example: When one of the people went out and took a picture, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""

Another reason for the Face on Mars to be just a natural landform is because of no real proof leading to aliens being there. The passage states that no aliens have interloped the area or anything. The text showed that overtime the face has deceased of showing up. The Garvin states that the Face has come down to looking like ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

My final reason that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform is that there was no alien momunment or alien archifact. The text states that on April 5, 1998 they got the first really well took picture of the Face on Mars. When they uploaded the picture, nothing of the sort of alien industry being there. The text also stated, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monunment after all.""

The Face on Mars was incredible to see. The people were craving to see the alien life become on Mars and as so was the NASA people. Everyone was stoked to have maybe a new set of living creatures come out. "" The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows - even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" Although, the Face on Mars was the only face that could be seen on there. The more pictures taken of this Face on Mars the more everyone found out that the face was more of a natural landform.

"I think that extracurricular activities shouldn't be forced upon students. Many students may find the extracurricular activities to be stressful, like public speaking or playing a sport. The activities can also be very time consuming, students already have lots of homework and adding a extracurricular activity could cause their grades to drop because not finishing homework or outside of school projects because they wouldn't have time for everything. The name extracurricular activity has the word extra in it, meaning that it should be a choice, not a requirement for students to do.

The extracurricular activities could add stress, not every students can handle the stress from their activity. Some activities, like public speaking and sports. Students can find the activities stressful because if they might mess up and embarrass their self. If they stutter in their speech or strike-out in a baseball game, they could be embarrassed greatly because they were forced into they activity rather if they choose to participate.

The extracurricular activities can be be very time consuming, students don't need one more thing they have to do. Students already have homework and projects, they activity could add more stress on top of the stress from homework and projects. The students might not finish their homework and projects resulting in there grade dropping because of they activity

Lastly, extracurricular activities should stay extra, it's in the name. Forcing students to do an extracurricular activity wouldn't them make extra anymore, more like a required activity that everyone has to do, which can be stressful and time consuming for the student. Extracurricular activity should remain as an extra activity for the students that can handle it.

The activities being potentially stressful, very time consuming and the activity no longer being an extra activity are reasons why I think students shouldn't be required for each and every student to do. If a student that think they could benefit from participating in the extracurricular activity should do an extracurricular activity but every student should have to especially the students that would be negatively impacted by being forced to do the activity.",0
"The quote says, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow."" I disagree with this statement. Because people need extend their studies, so that they can learn new important information that can benefit new research, also they can set new ideas, so they can make new studies and discoveries. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods

First way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow.

Second way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather it's good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families.

Third way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. It's another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger.

In conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it. That is why I disagree with this statement, and their is never enough or to good to learn. I will never get tired of learning new fascinating stuff about this world and the outer world.",0
"Everyone kowns that cars are dangerous. Think about how relaxing it would be to live life without the gases and the annoying sound of a motor that a car produce. This lead to the conclusion that automobiles are the linchpin of society.

People might say the idea of limiting automobiles usage is wrong because they need cars to go places but they because automobiles are causing people money for example in source 2 ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined,accorrding to Reuters twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.""

People should understand that cars are not the only means of transportation you can ride a bike in the cities to avoide being in the traffic  with the cars.

Citizens kown that if they do get a car get a plug-in or hybrid car. In source 4 sociologists  says  that the second largest source  Americas  emissions are transportation just behind power plants. Studies show that people who stopped car commuting find less reason to resume the habit.

So instead of using a car take a bus or a taxi. their are great advantages in limiting automobiles.                  ",0
"Why exactlly should one spend there time in the Seagoing Cowboy program? Being in the Seagoing Cowboy program is a progam you should participate in. Just think about the many horses and cows that are harmed and need our after help after a war. This experience is a great one and you should try it.

Traveling is a big part of this amazing program, you get to see so many many historic sites and arcitecture. Being able to cross the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean by boat is pretty cool. One of the times this was used was in 1945 after World War II ended in Europe. Also in 1945 the Seagoing Cowboys helped after the Pacific War had ended.

After world War II ended many countries were ruined to help fix this 44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). This is also a very good way to help in a fun way. The Seagoing Cowboy program saves many animals who would have else not made it through that deadly war or natural disaster. This is the program made for people who love animals. There are always cows or horses on board that are being rescued.

There is always work to be done as well. So, if your strong and like to work that could be a plus. Haybales and grain always need brought up from lower holds of the ship. Stalls always need cleaned and there is always work to be done. Sometimes you can catch a break on the way to another port and then you can relax.

So why should you join the Seagoing Cowboy program? Well for one reason, your helping so many animals and people too. There is always animals that need our help because well, animals can not talk for themselves so we have to be there for them. ",0
"Limiting Car Use

Many cities are now switching to become ""car free"".  The more that cities do this, we are seeing a decrease in pollution, less automobile related deaths per year, and more resources being conserved.

When cities switch to become car free, the pollution levels instantly decreasesd.  Due to the smog and the carbon monoxide emmitions in the atmosphere from cars, there is a hole in our Ozone layer in the atmosphere.  Now that people are banning cars in cities there is much more heathy air to breathe and it is much safer for our environment.  Also when there was more pollution in the air, and it rained, the rain turned in to acid rain causing erosion and killing several plants/animals.  If we could ban cars in more cities in the USA and all around the world, we would be living a much healthier lifestyle.

Also, the car free idea makes people much safer, as far as automobile accidents.  Because as the autombiles are banned from the city, the accident rate will go down more even than it already has.  Also Heidrun Walter said ""when I had a car I was alwyas tense.""  Not having a car, and not having the concern of crashing can relieve your stresses.  It is scientifically proven that when people are less stressed they get more sleep and have less angerment problems.  If cities switched to being car free, people could start living safer and happier.

Lastly, being car free, saves vital resources, and fossil fuels.  It takes millions of years to make oils, and gasses in the Earths crust, which we are wasting everyday on automobiles.  If we were able to save these resources, we could perhaps use more in rockets or space travel and maybe find another planet that can sustain our life.  If we were able to achieve this goal of saving resources, we could also all save money.  Imagine not having to pay for gas anymore.  You could be a millionare.  If we stopped using fossil fuels the world could become a much better place.

My point is, if we become car free, we could live safer, happier, and more wealthy lives.  If your community went the the mayor and state officials, it could happen for your city.  You could be the start to a revoulution and, start the journey to save humanity.  Not only would you get the bennifets of living safer, happier, and wealthier, but the whole world would be living in a much better place.  Please take this into consideration and make an effort to become ""car free"".               ",0
"In life, we all have to make decisions. Everyday choices, like deciding what shirt to wear or what to eat for lunch, generally do not have a huge impact or require much consideration. However, a time will come when you have to make a difficult decision that could affect many things in your life. In these situations, people tend to turn to their friends and family for advice. Before making the final decision, it is best to collect the opinions of multiple people. Seeking advice from more than one person will benefit you as everyone has different experiences and opinions, and you will learn the pros and cons of different views.

The first reason you should talk to different people before making an important decision is everybody has a different experiences an opinions. For example, if you are deciding where you want to go to collage and you ask your uncle, a James Madison University graduate, where he thinks you should go, he will most likely try to convince you that JMU is the best option. However, if you ask your aunt, a University of Virginia graduate, she will probably give reasons why you should attended UVA and not JMU.

It is important to talk to multiple people so you can better understand different perspectives and experiences.

The second reason getting advice from multiple people is helpful is you can understand both the pros and cons of your options. People are biased because of their experiences, and this can lead them to tell you the wonderful things about their opinions and the horrible things about otherÃÂ´s ideas. If you only ask one person for advice, you will only get half an opinion. This will leave you as misinformed as an inexperienced child. Collecting advice from many people allows you to hear positive and negative points about your choices.

All in all, seeking advice from multiple people can help you when making a challenging decision because you will receive opinions that allow you to view different experiences and you can see the pros and cons of your options. It will give you more knowledge about your decision and help you feel more comfortable with your final decision. If you are facing a challenging choice and turn to your loved ones for advice, be sure to ask a few of them!",0
"Changing the election to a vote of popularity is a great idea in my opinion. Citizens of the United States should be the people making the decision on who the President and Vice President should be. Congress would still have there need there vote of atleast two hundred and seventy member's, and the atleast %51 of the citizen's vote to pass it.

The electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of of electors, who in turn elect the president. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along wit the names of their respective electors.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. Consider the state legislature are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could aleays defy the will of the people.

There are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree:

1. Certainy of outcome 2. Evryone's president 3. Swing states 4. Big states 5. Avoid run-off elections

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Becasue of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, serventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and south Carolina, and oters in twenty five of the largest media markets. The electoral college is unfair and not right. I will have to agree with Bob Dole; ""Abolish the electoral college!""                             ",0
"By reducing our reliance on automobiles, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and livable future. It is time for us to recognize the negative impacts of our car-centric lifestyle and start embracing alternative modes of transportation.

One of the key advantages of reducing car usage is the positive impact it has on our environment. The excessive emission of greenhouse gases from vehicles significantly contributes to air pollution and climate change. By transitioning to greener transportation options such as walking, biking, and using public transportation, we can drastically decrease our carbon footprint and improve the air quality in our cities.

Furthermore, a reduction in car usage can also lead to improved public health. Studies have shown that vehicle emissions contribute to a range of health problems, including respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases. By adopting a carfree or car-lite lifestyle, we can mitigate these health risks and create healthier communities for ourselves and future generations.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, reducing car usage can also have positive social and economic impacts. Dependence on cars isolates individuals and communities, as it promotes individualistic travel rather than encouraging social interactions. By prioritizing pedestrian-friendly and bike-friendly infrastructure, we can foster a sense of community and create safer and more vibrant neighborhoods. Moreover, reallocating resources from car infrastructure towards public transportation systems can lead to cost savings for both individuals and governments, making our cities more affordable and accessible for all.

While some may argue that cars are necessary for convenience and efficiency, it is important to remember that the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits. The congestion caused by the excessive number of cars on our roads leads to significant time wastage and decreased productivity. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and investing in efficient public transit systems, we can alleviate congestion and create more efficient and seamless travel experiences for everyone.

Change begins with awareness and individual action. Each one of us has the power to make a difference by reducing our car usage and embracing alternative transportation methods. Governments and policymakers also play a crucial role in driving this change by implementing sustainable policies and investing in sustainable infrastructure. By working together, we can create a world that is not only free from the suffocating grip of pollution but also offers a better quality of life for all its inhabitants.

In conclusion, reducing car usage is a simple yet powerful solution to address the environmental, health, social, and economic challenges we face in our world today. The examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States show us that change is possible and that the benefits of a carfree lifestyle extend far beyond the individual. It is time for us to break free from the chains of automobile dependency and embark on a journey towards a greener, healthier, and more connected future. Let us join hands and revolutionize our world for the better.",1
"Usage of Phones While Driving

Each year thousands of people die in car crashes because of the use of cell phones while driving. The number of these deaths increase with every year. This is a major problem, especially for teenage drivers who are new to the road. Teenagers are not experienced enough and can also be easily distracted by their phones. While driving, if not paying full attention to the road, a teenager or anyone else could easily crash or get into a dangerous situation such as running through a red light because they were talking on the phone. Many states have started to see an increase in the number of people who text and drive and this directly contributes to the growing number of car accidents. Because of this, many states, including Georgia have taken action in an effort to reduce the growing number of wrecks due to cell phone usage. However, it seems that these set rules are not as strict as they should be and many states are quite lenient with the laws. Cell phone use needs to be more restricted while driving any type of automobile.

The first reason cell phones should not be used while driving and should be more restricted is because it is actually illegal in the United States. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 14 states have prohibited all drivers from using handheld devices while driving. Additionally, 46 states have banned texting and driving. State legislatures have seen the exponential growth in texting and driving along with the increase of automobile accidents. Therefore, the majority of the states have made the decision to pass laws that prohibit handheld devices such as cell phones. Many people who use their cell phones while driving have tried to state that they have no problem focusing on their driving while also using their technology. They have said that they have used cell phones multiple times while driving and have not caused one accident. However, researchers have proven that a person who uses their cell phone in any form while driving, is 2.8 times more likely to get into a wreck. Texting while driving is even more dangerous with it being 23.2 times more likely to get someone in an accident. Just because it does not happen to everyone one, does not mean that thousands of people have not lost their lives because of this problem.

Thousands of innocent adults, teens and children lose their lives everyday because of the actions and choices of those around them. When teens or children are in a car with an adult who is using their cell phone while they drive, that adult is putting those kids' lives at risk.

48% of kids in their younger teenage years have been in a vehicle while the adult driver was texting. In addition to that, 1,600 kids in that age range lose their lives every year because of people using their phones while they drive. Cars are amazing innovations that can get anyone to where they need to be quickly and efficiently. However, put them in the hands of someone who is irresponsible and a safe car becomes a potential weapon.

This is why cell phone use needs to be more restricted. Using a cellphone while driving gives the driver inattention blindness and also a slower reaction time. These are symptoms of drunk driving as well. If one would not drive with their children in the car while they are intoxicated, one should not text and drive or use their cell phone at all. A quick text or peek at social media, is not worth an innocent life.

On a lighter note, another reason cell phone use should be restricted is because it will save money. Drivers who do not use their phones while they are driving have financial benefits even if they do not realize it. Imagine all the traffic tickets, accidents and increased insurance rates that every person who uses their cell phone while driving has to deal with. If cell phones are more restricted, people will save so much money. While it does depend on which insurance company a driver is signed with, it has been shown that if one is involved with car accidents due to cell phone use, their insurance rates rise potentially up to 82%. Getting pulled over and handed a ticket more than once, means that person is now considered a high risk driver. High risk drivers have increased insurance or in extreme cases no insurance at all. If the insurance bill increases to be too high and that person cannot afford to pay it off, then the insurance company will sometimes repossess the car.

Any type of cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous and quite irresponsible.

Restricting cell phones to a higher degree would have many benefits. While plugging in a phone to listen to music is acceptable as long as the phone is not touched afterwards, texting someone back when it is not urgent or checking Snapchat, is not worth taking an innocent life. It is also not worth the driver's life. Car accidents and wrecks will happen to everyone, everywhere regardless of cell phone use or not. There are many other things that can distract drivers. However, not all of those things can be restricted but cell phones can. The rule needs to be enforced more. Once that happens, while wrecks will still happen, it will greatly lower the risk of more people getting hurt because their cell phone controls them and their actions.         ",0
"As exciting as alien formations on Mars would be, claiming the Face is of extraterestrial origin is like stating Old Faithful was dug by cavemen.

Nature can take a plethora of exotic forms.

We know this from exploring the many natural wonders of our own world, Earth.

That is why we can't jump to an irrational conclusion when faced with an irregular occurance.

You see, from a non-subjective view point, there is no face at all.

There is an area in your brain dedicated to breaking down the world around you and associating it with familiar objects and patterns.

This is why you may see a rabbit amoungst the clouds or a butterfly in an ink-blot test.

When it came to a low-resolution image of Martian rock formation with conveniently placed shadows, it only took a fraction of a second for our brains to automatically associate its appearance with something humans see everyday; a face.

In reality, there's no more of a face in the Face than there is an angel in an abstract painting.

Furthermore, evidence from NASA's most recent expodition has highlighted the Martian formation for what it truly is.

Compliments of rapidly evolving technology, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) sent in 2001 captured a brilliant, high-quality image of the Face.

With the camera's 1.56 meter per pixel resolution, it greatly shed a more vivid light on the planet in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976.

Now the formation could be identified as a natural butte or mesa on Mars.

It is very similiar to the rock formations one would find in western regions of the United States.

Since we know such rock forms are created by natural processes such as erosion, the theories of aliens can be firmly put to rest.

I will not completely disperse the possibility of foreign life forms outside of Earth; however, the Face is definitely not a product of an ancient civilization. As new data is gathered about the Red Planet, more anomilies will inevitably arise.

Curiousity is the essance of human nature, so we will undoubtly explore each mystery and may yet come across new signs of life.

Despite being just a rock, the Face had positive effects in sparking the public's interest in Mars. Perhaps one day very soon we'll have humans walking amoung the planet's rust-colored surface, trekking into the unknown.           ",0
"Every four years america as a whole chooses on who should be the president of the united states. The process of election is straight forward and always follows the same process every election. The american citizens vote on one of the two candidates, then those votes are counted and giving to the electors, then the electors of each state representing the population of said state (including the District of Columbia) votes one of the candidates, after all votes are tallied the winning candidate is elected president. Overall this system seems rather complicated and can be seen as an unfair process at which only to vote on who takes charge of america. The electoral college should be replaced by who receives the most popular votes from all american citizens and not the state electorals.

Electoral college is a process created during the founding of the united states as sort of a ""middleground"" or compromise on how the people of the country should elect the president (

source 1

). In order for a president to be elected out of the 538 electors that make up the electoral college he or she must at least receive 270 votes (

source 1

). Each president has a group of electors that process your votes in order to choose who the state votes for making it in a ways unfair. This system can come with its own set of problems that include replacement of electors, electors voting to who they feel, and at times one candidate gaining the most popular vote but losing the chance of presidency because of the lack of electorol votes form the state (

source 2

). An example of the unbalanced power is the near success of the louisiana legislature replacing the democratic electors in the 1960, segrigations with new ones that would oppose against John F. Kennedy making him lose the popular vote.

The best replacement for the electoral college is to allow the citizens of america to vote upon who should be the president of the U.S without the need for electors. The candidate that receives the most votes is the one who becomes the president of the united states. In order to process all possible millions of votes into a rational percentage and the candidate with the higher percentage would in turn become president. With this in mind the candidates would need to visit all or largely selected states in order to deliver campaign speeches to persuade the population to vote for them, because with the electoral college system candidates would focus mainly on tight races in the ""swing states"" practically ignoring other like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see their candidate (

source 2

). The electoral college only focuses on the large numbers and not on the smaller population that can still make a difference making the system unfair. Making them only focus on the big states because how many electoral votes it could bring compared to a smaller state which could possibly only supply three.

On the other side electoral college does have a good standing as a method of vote. Electoral college has five good reasons on why it shouldn't be replaced and they are certainty of outcom, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and avoid run-off elections (

source 3

). Each campaign party chooses their electors which rarely end in betrayel making it possible to win the election with low popularity votes. The electoral system also gives the candidate a chance to win in a ""landslide"" because of the winner-take-all basis at which it follows (

source 3

). No region has enough votes to elect a president also the electoral college needs to have transregional appeal. And the main goal of the electoral college is to obviously elect a new president but as well avoid runoff elections.

The electoral college is an unfair system of voting because of how it all depends on a small group of selected representatives and not all of the american population as a whole. Even though it can be regarded as a fair middle ground it still has its flaws and doesnt reach out to society as a whole only focusing on the states that can lead to victory, casting out those who's electoral votes will not make much of a difference. In the end the voting system should mainly focus on popularity of a candidate than what the ""state"" feels they should vote for because of how many votes they actually received for a given candidate due to the fact that it may end up voting on which who they feel and refuse to vote for their partys candidate. The electoral system should be replaced.    ",0
"Todays society uses automotive vehicles almoat everyday. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they wanna go. Smog has been building up from the cars pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people's health, an will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportaton less will help everyone an everything in the whole world from humans to the air we breath, from animals to the grass they eat.

However, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an everything out greatly. Banning cars for a day or bannins odd-numbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In  France they have banned odd-numbered an even-numbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for odd-numbered platwa on tuesday."" So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decrasing smog. An it also clears up congestion on the roads.

However, by using automotive transprtation less it will improve people's health. Walking, skatboarding, riding bicylces, or running will all imrove your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there an it would imrove your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. ""In Colombia, a program took plase an millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work."" That would greatly take a impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excersize for the day to improve their health.

So, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted so it affects the grass an vegetables that animals an humans consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen so we can continue to breath. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much an also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.

In conclusion,  using automotive transportsation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone's health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breath in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 an have dropped stedily since then. People are starting to drive less and less an it is greatly helping the entire world.                     ",0
"7 out of 10 students in every school participate in at least one after school activity. After school activities consist of participating in sports, helping other students out, and cleaning the school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home, some parents won't allow their children to stay after school, and students will go home later than usual.

I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home. Students have to do chores, homework, take care of their siblings, they wouldn't have time to do any of these things. They will have somehow make time or do it some other day. One example of this is one day the principal told me that I had to stay after school to do a sport. Next, I called my mother telling her that I had to stay after. I tried out for track and made the team, I had forgotten that my mother wanted me to cook the chicken because she wasn't going to be home. Later that day, I went home and my mother was furious! I felt so stupid for forgetting to go home and cook the chicken that she had prepared the day before. My mom yelled at me, but she ended up forgiving me but she didn't want me to stay after anymore even if the principal made me. Another example is one day I had to stay after school to clean the floors of the hallways because my principal said the custodians needed help. What's crazy is that same day was my sister's graduation! My own self even forgot to give my mother a call telling her that I was going to stay after. I eventually finished quite fast, actually. After, I walked home and my mother was waiting for me, she asked why I came home so late and if I don't care about my sister. I was literally confused, I had no idea why she was involving my sister into this. Finally, I realized why my mother involved my sister, it was because her graduation! I apologized, and I never stayed after again. Overall, this is why I believe that the principal should not make students participate in at least one after school activity.

My second reason why I disagree that all students must participate in after school activities is because some parents won't allow their children to stay after school. Parents are very protective over their children, it was hard enough for them to let us go on our first day of school in Kindergarten; now they have to be even more cautious. One example is one day I was in English, which is my last two periods in school. The principal went over the intercom saying that there was going to be tryouts for volleyball. I really wanted to try out, being in a sport is something I always wanted to do. Also, I wanted to get into better shape. After, I called my mother asking if I could stay after school to try out and she said no. My mother and I went back and forth arguing why she wouldn't let me. Her voice started to break and she said that she's scared and she doesn't want me to. So, I didn't try out, I missed all of the try outs for volleyball. Later, my mother got a call from the principal from my school asking why she didn't let me, he overheard our conversations when I was on the phone with her. My mother kept telling the principal that she's not going to let me stay after. Lastly, I never stayed after because I knew my mother was never going to let me. Another example is one day I stayed after school because they were going to play a horror movie in the auditorium and the principal wanted as much students that could stay. I was excited, I've never stayed after school before, it was going to be a day to remember. Soon enough, I feel my phone vibrate. My mother was spamming my phone with text messages! I ran out of the auditorium and called my mom, she was between furious and worried. She sounded like she wanted to cry but also wanting to yell at me and hit me. My mother picked me up from school and we drove around and she told me how if I wanted to stay after I had to let her know before hand. Overall, this is why I think that the principal should not make students stay after school because some parents won't let them.

My final reason on why I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because students will go home later than usual. When students stay after, it's usually for about two hours. In that case, that would mean if school ends at 2:50, then if you stayed after school you would go home around 4:50. An example is one day my friend named Generic_Name stayed after school for a yearbook program. Later on, the program took longer than she expected, she got home around five. Her father screamed at her for coming home so late. It was late for him because the sun was already going down. I felt so bad, she came to school the next day saying she couldn't stay after anymore for the yearbook program or anything dealing with staying after. Another example is I was staying after school for a track meet and I was the manager because the principal wanted me to be the manager. The meet ended at 7:30, I honestly didn't think the meet was going to end at 7:30. My sister came to pick me up and she said if my parents were home they were going to be so mad. I should've sent a text to my sisters or my parents telling them I was going to go home late. Overall, this is why I believe that students shouldn't have to participate in after school activities.

Because of students having to do other things at home, parents not allowing them to stay after school, and students getting home later than usual, I believe it should not be a must to do an after school activity, even if the principal wanted to. ",0
"Hey there!  So, um, art is like, super cool and all, and I totally love creating different types of art. Like, I'm really into painting right now, and I've been experimenting with different styles and techniques. I find it really relaxing and therapeutic, you know?  But, like, I also enjoy drawing and sketching, and sometimes I even dabble in digital art.  It's just, I don't know, it's like, my way of expressing myself, you know? 

But, like, have you ever wondered how art pieces are sold and how much they can fetch in the market?  I mean, I know some art pieces can be really expensive, like, millions of dollars expensive!  And it's not just like, the famous artists who can command those prices, either.  Like, even local artists can sell their work for decent amounts of money if they're really talented. 

But, like, creating art isn't always easy, you know?  It takes a lot of patience and practice to get really good at it.

Subject: In Favor of Preserving the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a switch to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College system serves as a vital component of our democratic system. This letter aims to present a balanced view, addressing both the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College, while ultimately advocating for its preservation.

One of the primary benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure a certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral vote is less likely compared to a dispute over the popular vote. He highlights that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electoral votes ensures that a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral victory, increasing the likelihood of a stable outcome.

Moreover, the Electoral College system ensures that the president represents the entire nation rather than just one region. Candidates are required to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency. This prevents candidates from solely catering to specific regions and encourages them to put forth policies that benefit the entire country. It fosters a sense of inclusivity among voters, preventing them from feeling disenfranchised and disconnected from the president's decision-making process.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it emphasizes the importance of swing states. With a ""winner-take-all"" mechanism, candidates are motivated to campaign in swing states, where voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and participate in informed decision-making. By focusing their efforts on states with tight races, candidates engage in extensive debates, discussions, and interactions with the electorate, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters, who are likely to influence the outcome, have the opportunity to be heard.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides smaller states with a fairer representation in the presidential election process. As Judge Posner acknowledges, the Electoral College compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate by giving larger states, by population, more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. By doing so, it restores a balance in the political influence of large and small states, ensuring that no state's voice is overshadowed or disregarded.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the election process. Instead, it always produces a clear winner, eliminating the uncertainty and additional costs associated with run-off elections. This efficiency ensures a smooth transition of power and allows for a seamless continuation of governance.

While critics argue that the Electoral College disadvantages voters by disengaging those from states with predictable outcomes, the reality is that voters are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences. Despite the certainty that their individual vote may not swing a national election, the majority of eligible American voters still choose to participate in the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, with its advantages in ensuring a certainty of outcome, promoting a sense of national representation, highlighting the importance of swing states, providing fair representation to smaller states, and avoiding the complications of run-off elections, remains a crucial component of our democracy. It strikes a balance between democratic ideals and practical considerations that should be preserved to maintain the integrity and stability of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my perspective. I trust that you will take into account the multiple viewpoints on this issue as you make decisions that impact our democratic processes.

Sincerely,

"To whomever it may concern, The process of the Electoral College has been a problem for many years and deserves to be abolished at its roots. The Electoral College should not be kept due to the fact that not many Americans comprehend this legal process, swing vote catastrophes and other problems, and its lack of democratic pedigree. You may wonder why someone like me is even writing about this or why I even care, but I care about what happens in my country's economy and government, and others should too.

First thing's first: knowledge. From personal experiences and research, you may realize that the majority of Americans in 2014 couldn't describe to you what the process of the Electoral College even is. Each state is different in this process, just like each opinion is different about this topic. This is an immensely confusing subject to read about, especially when you're just an average person watching the news or reading an article online. Although, let's be real for a minute: its really difficult. The process consists of selecting the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for our President and Vice President. Also, in school curriculum across the country, you never really go into depth about the Electoral College unless you're taking a hardcore government class. In this case, the students are yet to be informed about the causes and effects of the Electoral College and the disasters it can cause in our economy.

Let's continue, shall we? The swing vote catastrophes, the worrying about who will be elected and whether or not they'll do a good job controlling our government, it's just not worth it. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election rather than the system that we use now. When citizens vote, they're basically voting for slates of electors, who then eventually vote to elect the President as well as the Vice President. The question is: Who are the electors? Who picks them? Are they responsible with the task at hand? The fact of the matter is that you really have no control over who the electors vote for. A ""faithless"" elector can vote for whomever they please, even if it isn't their party's candidate. This process is extremely unfair to voters across the country, and I doubt the phrase ""Life isn't fair"", a quote by my grandmother, would even apply to this discussion.

As previously stated, the process of the Electoral College isn't the greatest of them all, nor is it fair to voters. I asked who the electors were, and who picks them... but where is the abundant democratic pedigree? To remind you, a democratic pedigree is the origin and history of something, especially when it is good or impressive to others. The Electoral College is outdated and irrational for our modern day concepts. This extensive process lacks alot of opinions, evidence, and background knowledge that is necessary when voting for candidates. On the other hand, there is usually a certainty of outcome in the election, and it avoids runoff elections which is pleasant to citizens who are for the Electoral College. What about the swing votes? What about the values?

To wrap things up, the Electoral College is not needed in the United States government because of lack of understanding, disasters that may be caused, and the democratic pedigree and honesty that is nowhere to be found. I hope you consider my decisions and grow very fond of my reasonings.",0

Dear Principal,

I have just discovered this new policy you have decided that us as students can't participate in school sports unless we have a grade B average. I do not think this is a very good policy because if you are really good in sports, but your not the best at science, or math or any subject that wouldn't fair to them. I personally have one subject I am not doing very well in, but I try and do my work and maintain the average of low B and high C. So that would consider me unable of not doing any sports. I love sports, my life revolves around sports. But just because I'm not doing good in one subject that doesn't mean I can't be part of something that makes me happy, makes me health.

I also think that if you make this policy happen, kids may turn bad. if you make this happen you will just help the population of kids turning to bad influences. I know from experiences that the kids that have been on my team in the past were good at the sports they did and instead of going to a party or going in the woods to do bad things, we were at practice working as hard as we can just to win divisions, or even states. There were girls in the past who couldn't do math or didn't understand some subjects but they tried hard and maintain an A, B or C average. It wouldn't be fair to the girls who try in school, but just aren't good at the subject.

My last reason is that if you change this policy, you could ruin the chances of some kids who are amazing at sports chances of getting a scholarships in sports. I know for one thing me personally I want a scholarship so badly, and I work for it too. But if I get a C in one subject that could ruin my chances of practicing and competing. Which is really hurtfully because I've worked my whole life for a scholarship. So instead of me or anyone being a pro or being an Olympic winner, we'll be working at Subway for the rest of our life's earning practically nothing. And I don't want my future to come to this quote, "" Welcome to Subway, what can I get you?""

In the end, I hope that you don't change the policy, because if you do a lot of kids will have there whole life changed and maybe even ruined. And its not like a C isn't passing because it is and you should have a passing grade to play sports. Most people in school have a C or B average because its most common. And as a Principal you should be the one supporting us to be in sports and after school actives, you should know that most parents say to their kids is to get involved. In conclusion I hope you make the choice that benefits us all as students and a school.

Sincerely,

"dear principal,

I think students should be able to bring there cell phones to school and use them on free times cause suppose it is a emergency from your parents and they want to get in contact with you at least they know you have a cell phone the reason i agree with policy one is because in case of an emergency , you just want to listen to music on your free time or you just want to have your phone with you.

In case of an emergency you will have a phone to contact your parent or guardian or your parent or guardian can contact you suppose the school was on fire you would want to let your parents no about it so you can just call them on your cell phone or any other minor injuries you can just aware them about it.

On free time most students will want to listen to music if there bored and some teachers may not understand but music helps a lot of teenagers now a days to concentrate and it can also help you focus but its not that bad you can listen to your music on free time.

Music is one of the things most of teenagers like to listen to so i think we should have cell phones allowed at our school

Most teenagers just like to have there phone with them at all times so they can show everyone or just for them to have like if you want to know the time and the television is off in the classroom you can just look on your phone and if your parents are trying to text you something like saying don't ride the bus today it can be very helpful to have your phone .

A lot of teenagers love having there cell phones so i think policy 1 is really good because of emergencies or any sort of injures or anything you can have your phone with you at all times to call up your parents or who ever you call you so i hope everyone else would agree on policy 1            ",0
"I disagree that all students should take extracurricular activity's.

if a students take these extra activity's, If a kid dosn't want to do it then don't force them to, if a kid is doing a sport out side of school they should not have to do a sport in school and make them quit there sport that they are already doing one, it could over work the students.

If a student dosn't want to do the extracurricular activity's then why do you have to force them to do it. If you force the student to do it then they wont try if they don't like the thing there doing and fail. students should have the ability to chose whether or not to chose a extracurricular activity because if they dont want to do it they dont have to.

If a student is doing a sport out side of school than they should be able to chose whether they quit the sport there doing out side of school or be over worked with doing a sport in side and out side of school. if you have two sports it could over whelm students. students will give up or not try as hard in in school activities than out of school activates.

All of the thing student do in school is probably enoph but adding another thing could over work students or make them stressed out about all of the thing that they are doing. and as I said earlier student will give up and no try because they hate doing it.

In conclusion these are the reasons why I think students should not be forced to do extracurricular activity.",0
"The idea of automated driverless cars seems like an invention from a utopian future, but it csuses many potential problems when humans are involved. The question of how to punish a robot arises with the invention of this technology, as well as what the affect on humans would be of having everything done for you by robots. Although this idea is promising and could still be used. Automative transport is quite the visionary idea despite its falacies.

The introduction of driverless cars would warrant the creation of new rules of the road, but that raises the question of whether the passenger or the robot recieves punishment. Also, how would one punish a robot for breaking the law? They are not human so any punishment would be unaffective. Also based on the imformatiom given in paragraph 7, humans might be required to remain partially in control, and if the cars are partial human controlled, how would we guarrentee that the person arrested was actually the offender? The robot could have framed the human.

Another negative side-effect of driverless cars would be that humans could become too lazy and unalert. The human is not required to be alert to the situation of the road, so humans might lose the ability of knowing how to drive. There is also an increasing dependance on machinery to do our jobs for us, and machines are known to not be as capable as a human if there is a problem. Also, if a robot malfunctions while a human is in the car, there would be the question of how the human would handle that situation.

Although, to remain positive about the idea, there are several alternatives that alleviate these potential catastrophies. The idea could still be utilized via public transport. Based on the large amount of sensors that are required for the vehicles to work, ass outlined in paragraph 3 and 4, areas that have little interference would be ideal for these automated cars. Subways run underground where there is an asbsence of human activity, this would be a perfect enviornment for automated transport to be implemented. Another place that is devoid of human interferrence is the ocean. There could be automated cruiseliners that can transport people across water, where there is a lack of traffic problems.

In conclusion, the idea for automated cars is a potentially dangerous and complex, but the idea should not be thrown out. The problems with false accusations and how to punish an automated car arise; as well as the fact that humans could become lazy and unalert in their enviornment. These problems could potentially be solved by changing the venue of where automated transportation is utilized.",0
"Im Generic_Name and my special skill/talent is that I am a competitor. I like to compete when it comes to certain things, because It motivates me to practice and work for what i want to achieve. I got my competitive spirit from my older brother. But I usually get competitive when it comes to video games or sports. But I also like to compete because I like to win.

How did my brother make me competitive? He would always say that I would lose and it would change my whole perspective of things. He would always win, so it would motivate me to practice. Me watching him practice would also make me competitive cause him practicing would motivate me to practice to try to be the best. He would also like to say that ""you're gonna lose"" and it would change my whole mood.

How does being competitive motivate me? It motivates me to practice, because it makes me want to be the best I want to be. It also motivates me more if I lose, because it makes me want to do the same thing again until i win at it. Watching my favorite sports motivate me cause it makes me want to be in those big leagues someday. My goal is to be a pro basketball player and I cant get there if i'm not competitive.

Being competitive can get you a future in anything and you should work on this skill. It will teach you life lessons, it will make you be successful, and it will teach you to work hard for what you want. You should have a goal set in mind and just go work hard and achieve that goal. Are you a competitive person? Whats your goal so you can work hard at it and achieve it?",0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so I've been thinking a lot about Thomas Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up. Like, he was like a total genius and all, but I'm not sure if I could actually do all that hard work and stuff. I mean, I'm pretty good at math and stuff, but I get tired easily and stuff. But, like, he was like a total pioneer and stuff, and he helped make America what it is today. So, I guess it's worth looking into his ideas and stuff.

So, like, one of the biggest benefits of following Thomas Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up is that it can help you achieve your goals. Like, he was a total visionary and he had a lot of big ideas, but he never gave up on them. And look where it got him! He became the third President of the United States! That's like, super impressive. And if you work hard and never give up, you can achieve anything you want. It's like, the sky's the limit or something.

But, like, there are also some drawbacks to following his idea. For one thing, it can be really, really hard. Like, he was a total workaholic and he worked all the time. And I'm like, I get tired just thinking about it. I don't know if I could do that every day. And plus, it's not just about working hard, it's also about being smart and stuff. Like, he was a total genius and he knew a lot of stuff. I'm like, I'm not sure if I could ever be as smart as him.

So, like, I don't know if I could totally follow Thomas Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up. But, like, it's definitely something to think about. Maybe I could try to work harder and stuff, but also take breaks and not overdo it. And maybe I could also try to learn more stuff and be more smart like him. That would be pretty cool.

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you liked it. Let me know what you think",1

"Dear principal,

Almost no one has a B average so i think its not fair that those who want to play outside sports can't i think it should be based on if there even trying at school not how their grade is. That's stripping kids of their right to do what the want with their lives what if some kids don't want to go home to their parents what if they had nothing else to do what would you think of that or would it be the same kids do what you think is right but might no be what you thought? One day kids will revolt over that and it might not be so pretty and innocent.

We're not as stupid as you think we just need a good influence to inspire us to do better and obviously if we haven't done it yet then we haven't found the right influence yet. I think what your doing to the sports issue at school is wrong and your opinion of it is invalid to me. But that might just be to me imp not sure about the other students but i think all of our opinions on this are close to the same and just as valid as vote for the president to me. That's what i think of your rule we need to have a B average to not participate in school sports and if more people think i' m wrong for doing so then enlighten me others wise.

Sincerely, Student

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that students should be involved in community service because then it gives other schools good examples on how great our school is. And it also sets a good example. If we do community service then we are helping our environment and grow big as a society. We will be helping the earth and stop pollution.

If all students perform it then the more help there will be to help out. My idea is to have groups of people every week to stay after school and do community service. Students can pick out the people they would like to work with and turn a sheet in for what team they are on and what grade and then the teachers will set out who goes with who, depending on the number of how big the group is then it will all be sorted out.

That's one way of doing it and then the other thing that might interrupt that is if they are in after school activities then those kids wont have to do it but when their activity is over with for the year then they will have to be in the week they are called in to doing community service.

And every Friday instead of having advisory we can try and clean up the community, like, picking up bottles, paper, cans, and any kind of garbage that might be on the ground.

Like I said before this can make a big difference in the world and make not just students but every one to actually care about how our environment looks and feels like.

Just like my mom always tells me ""If you want you're room to be clean all you need to do is clean it up.""

I always think about that saying that my mom tells me when i think about cleaning the environment.

But i really do think that you should follow this idea it might take along time but its all worth it if you're helping something be strong again.",0
"Dear principal,

I think that you should require everyone to do community service because it helps everyone. Some people might not like it at first, like if there helping the less fortunate. They might change overtime because they see how bad some peoples life is, and that they should be thankful that they have a good life. So they could help them even more. I think we should have a field trip to help the homeless people by making them food and giving them clothes. And if some people still don't like helping, then they are selfish.

You should make it that we have to do community service in order to graduate. So if some people think its a waste of time, then they wont graduate. So were sort of forcing them to do it, but at least they are doing community service. And even maybe will they change a little and think a little more about the homeless people. Then they would want to help even more.

Another part of the community service for them to do in order to graduate is help clean up trash. There is a lot of trash everywhere. I think we should at least help clean up some of the world. And if we can do that, less animals will go extinct. So it would be nice if the world could be clean. And if they like helping then they will pass it on to other people and then the world would be nice. It would be fun if we go to the beach for a field trip and help clean up the beach. Then have a barbecue afterwards and swim in the beach.

Community service does take up some time. But some people don't want to do it is because they would rather be lazy at home and watch t. v. or play video games. But some people might even be busy. It only takes an hour or so to help clean up the neighborhood or give a homeless person food or clothing. I think we should get donations from companies that would give us free clothing and some small snacks. Then everyone could bring a bag and fill it the those items. Then when they are driving, and when they see a homeless person, they give them the bag. It's as easy as that. And its really short too, so that could be one way it could not take up there time because there driving home from school and if they see a homeless person, give it to them.

So community service is fun and it helps everyone. And could take up some time and it maybe wont take up time. So I think that it should be required to do community service.

"One of the greatest examples of success against the odds is Wilma Rudolph, a champion Olympian who overcame childhood polio to become one of the greatest sprinters in history. Despite hardships, she pursued her goal of athletic greatness and achieved it, against all odds. Even when presented with failure, Wilma saw it as a learning experience and she was motivated to strive for the success she deserved. Along with her own hard work, she was driven by her determination and a determination to reach her own potential. 

Rather than aiming low and potentially missing out on success, it is better to aim higher and work hard to make one’s dreams come true. With hard work, dedication and the will to strive for success, great things can be achieved, no matter the odds. Achieving partially is better than not achieving at all, and the possibility of not reaching a goal is far less than the possibility of success. Ultimately, it is better to aim high and strive for success, as it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to reach for one’s goals.",1
"Dear principal,

I am not here to argue with you but I do not agree with you that there should be a policy change that you have to have a B average to play a sport. Sports and grades are two totally different things in my opinion. Kids are already having a hard time getting a C average just to play a sport. Even some kids can't get a C average to play a sport so they can't do it. I think it's ridiculous that you have to have a certain grade average to play a sport. Sports are a activity; not getting homework in on time or studying for a test. Those are two totally different topics to me.

If you changed the school policy so that you have to have a B average to participate in school activities or school sports you wouldn't have as many kids in sports or you might even have kids moving to other schools. Kids would defiantly try harder to get their grades up but teachers may not understand how hard it is to do those kind of things. Changing the school policy so that you have to have a B average is not understandable to me. Other students may not agree with me or you may not agree with me but people that want to play sports will agree with me 100%.

Like I've said before, school grades and sports are not the same thing in my opinion. Sports are handling a challenge with another team or learning how to play the sport and grades are understanding life and the history of everything. Learning how to write stories and learning how to handle a ball are two totally different things. I would just like to end this with you should not change the school policy so that you have to have a B average to play sports or be in activities but you have the total control over it.

"Dear Principal,

I believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.

Look at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.

"1 in every 4 student learn best on their own outside of a classroom. In the age where learning online is being used in classrooms more every year, Learning online is now accessible everywhere. Forcing those students into a environment they are not use to will cause great stress and grade reductions. Students who need to take classes at home will greatly impact not only their grades in a positive matter but also their mental health. Students who learn best on their own should be given the chance to take online courses to take home.

In a research article written by a college student, He goes on to write about his research on a students mind and work habits in different environments. He conducted his research and came with different outcomes three of which dealt with working at home, in a busy classroom, and a one on one class with a teacher. He asked the two students what their preferred method of learning was and then put them into all three and recorded it. One student stated he worked best in his room and on his own. The other from help of a teacher. This research helps to show the impact that different work environments for different students.

The student who said they worked best in his room and or alone showed the biggest results. He worked most productive in his room like he stated but also worked well in a one on one with the teacher. This shows how the student if given the option to take an online course would do so. He got his work done and focused on it until he had finished. The other student could be used to represent the other 3 out of 4. He worked best in a one on one with a teacher and also in a classroom with other peers to assist. The student who worked alone benefited the most with completing their work and completing it well. When put into the classroom he struggled to stay on task with that causing stress and could not complete his work with the same effort as while at home.

although many argue that letting students stay at home to do school work will make them lazy or become irresponsible this just isn't a valuable argument. Setting distance classes as optional is what really counters that thought. Student who believe they learn best in a class space, they will not take the option to take the class online. while the others who believe they learn best on their own will do so. The option should be given to all students and then there they will decide in which environment they learn best, and for the maximum amount of students can benefit from this option.         ",0
"Summer projects should be student-designed because students are busy during the summer and teachers make projects to complicated.

One of the reasons why they should student-designed is that students are busy during the summer. Students already go through so much during the school year, whether it be drama with another student, annoying teachers, bullying, and even fights, so when school is over students just want to get away from it all. Most of the time students will go see a parent, or go out of town, so they wonÃÂ´t even have time to do a project.

My other reason is that teachers make projects to complicated. Most teachers give projects at least twice a year, and one of the two will always be to complicated to do. Teachers know that students go out of town during the summer, but they will still give you a super complicated project just because youÃÂ´ll have the whole summer to do it.

Some people might think that summer projects should be teacher-designed because the project grade might help their grade out, but what if you fail the project? What if you canÃÂ´t finish in time? Both of these could happen, then what will you do? ThereÃÂ´s nothing you can do because itÃÂ´ll be to late for you to say something, but both of those problems can be avoided if you just make summer projects student-designed.

So now youÃÂ´ve heard my reasons on why summer projects should be student-designed, and the reasons are that students are busy during the summer and teachers make projects to complicated.",0
" Is it beneficial for young students to commit to a career path in high school? It is a wise decision that allows students to focus on their desired career, rather than on subjects that do not align with their goals. There are several reasons why I believe this is a good idea.

First, students can follow in the footsteps of their parents or other family members who have chosen successful careers. This can be a valuable source of guidance and inspiration, as well as a way to connect with their family's legacy. By following in the footsteps of their parents or other family members, students can gain insight into the skills and knowledge required for their chosen career, as well as the potential challenges and rewards.

Second, students can use their high school courses to excel in their chosen career path. High schools offer a variety of courses that can help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen field. For example, a student who wants to become a chef can take cooking classes, while a student who wants to become an engineer can take courses in math, science, history, and English. By taking these courses, students can gain a head start on their future careers and be better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.

Finally, committing to a career path in high school can help students stay focused and motivated. When students know what they want to do, they can plan their courses and activities around their goals. This can help them stay on track and avoid distractions that might lead them away from their desired career path. Additionally, when asked about their future plans, students who have committed to a career path can speak confidently and with conviction, which can be a valuable asset in both personal and professional settings.

In conclusion, committing to a career path in high school can be a beneficial decision for young students. By following in the footsteps of their parents or other family members, using their high school courses to excel in their chosen field, and staying focused and motivated, students can set themselves up for success in their future careers.",1
"Should summer projects be student-designed? In my opinion, yes; I feel as though summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to express their creativity and have the freedom to think outside the box, rather than be held back of their ideas and inner thoughts. On the other hand, teachers also feel as though that they should be allowed to give specific project topics or ideas to their students, instead of students creatively thinking for themselves due to a lack of performance in the classroom. Though, teachers believe summer projects should be designed through their ideas due to poor performance in the classroom, students should be given a chance to express themselves and the freedom to create their own projects.

As a student, summer break is supposed to be a time to get away from school, classwork, homework, and a time to relax. However, in other schools; learning never stops. Due to schools wanting kids to learn during summer vacation, students are given summer projects to keep them focused. All students around different schools believe that having the chance to create things using their ideas will enhance their learning experience. Also, students feel as though that teachers are more in tune of what the students feel or want, rather than give them an assignment that doesn't appeal to them as much. Furthermore, I; myself as a student has had the chance to receive student-designed projects and to me, it's one of the greatest things not only for me, but for my classmates as well; it allows us to show our ability in what we know how to do and how well do we understand the topic we choose in exchange for a good grade.

In other cases, there are teachers who believe that classroom performance can play a roll in students receiving teacher-designed projects during the summer. Some teachers disagree in allowing a class to behave poorly or set low expectations for each other and give them an assignment that will be ""fun"" or ""enjoyable"" to please students. Other teachers for instance, think that students need to challenge themselves more in class and not settle for a decent grade, instead; elevate their work ethic to a greater amount for the grade they worked for. However, teachers will also give assignments just based on lesson plans or things they truly believe is what needs to be focused on and assigned to the students.

In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to have projects designed by them to see what they know, showcase their ability of creating a unique topic that's original, and allow teachers to see what students can do on their own, than seek guidance to have a planned project assigned to them.",0
"Albert Einstein famously said, “imagination is more important than knowledge.” This statement is certainly true in the case of Einstein himself. He is well known for his groundbreaking discoveries and inventions, from developing the theory of relativity to his Nobel Prize winning work on the photoelectric effect. However, these inventions and accomplishments weren’t the result of mere knowledge or memorized facts. Instead, Einstein relied on his imagination and ability to think outside the box. He was able to draw connections between different lines of thought and concepts that had been previously considered unrelated or incongruous, a feat enabled by his strong and creative imagination. Additionally, Einstein's ideas were not limited to scientific discoveries; his humanistic views and philosophies on life were also formed and expressed through his imaginative powers. Ultimately, then, it's evident from the life and work of Albert Einstein that imagination is indeed more important than knowledge.",1
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about whether it's better to graduate early or take the normal four-year route. I'll give you the pros and cons of each and then decide which one is better. 🤔

First, let's talk about the pros of graduating early. One big pro is that you get to start college earlier! 🎉 That means you can get a head start on your degree and maybe even finish it faster. Plus, you'll have more time to focus on your passions and interests outside of school. 🎭 You can start working on your dreams early, instead of waiting until after high school. 💡

Another pro of graduating early is that it can be less stressful. 😩 Think about it, you don't have to take as many classes or deal with as much homework in the same amount of time. You can take a lighter load and focus on your own personal growth. 🌱 It's like a breath of fresh air! 🌲

Now, let's talk about the cons of graduating early. One con is that you might miss out on some important experiences. 🤔 Like, you might not have as much time to hang out with your friends or participate in extracurricular activities. You might also miss out on some important social interactions that can help you grow as a person. 🤝 It's like, you're giving up some of your teenage years to get ahead in life. 😔

Another con of graduating early is that it can be challenging. 💪 You'll have to take extra classes to catch up on the material you missed, and it can be hard to keep up with the workload. It's like, you're trying to drink from a firehose! 💧 You might also struggle to adjust to college life, especially if you're not used to being around older students. 😅

So, after thinking about all the pros and cons, I think it's clear that both sides have their benefits.",1
"There are people who are not happy with the career path they took. People wished that they could of done something to change what they do for a living and do something they will be truly happy with. There are people who are sad and deperessed on the job they have now. It takes time,focus, and motivation for a student to find the career they truly would want to take in the future.

Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that.

Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing. And in doing so when they are doing something that they never imagined themselves doing then depression and regret will start happening.

With the job they are being forced into doing they might not be able in doing it. For example if a student is being forced in a scientific field of learning but they know that science isnt there strong suit they will have a hard time and start having a hard time in that field. Students know what is best for them and know what will benifit them and find a path that would be best for there needs.

Some people might say that having students pick a career at a young age will help them in the future because it will give them more time so strengthen that career and become very good at it. What people dont understand is that some students might not be intersted in that and would want something they would b happy with so they can improve on the stuff they know they are good at and have alot of skill in. Students have the right and the liberty in choosing a carrer they would want to do for the rest of there lives they dont need to be pushed into doing it they should take as much time as they need to find what is it that would make them happy.",0
"""Hmm,"" said Generic_Name as he thought about what sport he should choose to play after school. ""I am completely lost,"" Generic_Name thought to himself. Generic_Name couldn't make up his mind at all, ""Perhaps I should ask someone what sport they think I should play,"" said Generic_Name. Some time later Generic_Name met up with his friend Generic_Name. ""What sport do you think I should play?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""Well I enjoy playing soccer, so I think you should play soccer too"" Generic_Name replied. Generic_Name didn't even think about soccer until Generic_Name mentioned it. He thought soccer was a great idea but he also thought he should get more opinions from other people. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make the better choice because they will have more options to choose from, they can make the best choice possible, and they might get ideas that they didn't even of yet.

First, they will have more options to choose from. The more options you have to choose from, the better it is for you. To clarify, someone who gets one opinion doesn't have as many options as someone who gets five opinions. The person who asked five different people for their opinion would have a better chance in making the best choice because he has more options to choose from than the person who only got one opinion. Having more choices to choose from can make you think harder about your final decision. To elaborate, the more choices you have, the more you have to think in order to make you decision. Because you have more options, it will take you longer to come up with you decision. In summery, one way to make the better choice is to have many options to choose from.

Next, they can make the best choice possible. To begin with, you get the chance to decide which option is the best for you. For example, if you had the option to join both the basketball team and the football team, you would join which ever team you like the most. If you like to play football, you would join the football team. If you prefer play basketball, then you would join the basketball team. It's best to have at least three or more different opinions from people that you know because the opinion that they give you could be based off of things that they know that you like to do, see, or even play. For instance, if you ask someone such as you parents, your teachers, or even you friends, which sport you should play, depending on how long you've known them, they can tell you an honest answer that can help you out in making the best choice. To summarize, it is very important to have multiple opinions because they can help you make the best choice possible.

Lastly, they might get ideas that they didn't even think of yet. To start off with, the person you ask could help you make you decision by giving you an idea that you didn't think of. For example, when Generic_Name asked his friend Generic_Name what sport he should play. Generic_Name told him that he should play soccer. Playing soccer didn't cross Generic_Name's mind so when Generic_Name recommended it to him Generic_Name got a new option that he didn't think of before. The more you ask people for their opinion, the more likely you are to get brand new ideas that you didn't think of before. In fact, the more people Generic_Name were to ask, the more brand new ideas he would get. Therefore, getting multiple opinions can increase your chances of getting new ideas that you haven't thought of yet.

""So what do you think I should do?"" Generic_Name asked his dad. ""Well when I was about your age I played football and knowing how you play it all the time with your friends, I think you should do football."" Generic_Name's Dad replied. Generic_Name took it into consideration and really like the thought about playing football after school. Just to be safe Generic_Name asked one more person for their opinion on what he should play. Generic_Name thought it would only be right to ask his favorite gym teacher Mr. Generic_Name since they always do all kinds of activities in his class. ""Mr. Generic_Name what sport do you think I should choose to play?"" Generic_Name asked politely. ""When we played baseball in class you really seemed to enjoy it,"" Mr. Generic_Name said. ""Your right I really did enjoy playing baseball in class, tGeneric_Name Mr. Generic_Name!"" said Generic_Name as he waved goodbye to Mr. Generic_Name. Now that Generic_Name had three different options to choose from he was ready to make his decision. Generic_Name though about it for a while until he knew what he was going to choose. ""I'll play football!"" Generic_Name said. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make the better choice because they will have more options to choose from, they can make the best choice possible, and they might get ideas that they didn't even of yet.",0
"We should keep the Electoral College because it helps the people choose a president easily then just by popular votes. The process that helps the people choose a president is easy thanks to the Electorl College. According to the source 1 ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" (source 1).

The process for Electoral College is very simple for our Nation. The process as stated is ""The Electoral College process consits of selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" (Source 1). That is why we should keep the Electoral College because the process is that simple.

The reason we shouldn't get rid of the Electoral College because just electing a President on popular votes is not far to the states that don't get to many votes. As stated in the article "" The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" (Source 1). The disaster that comes with the electoral college can be catastrophic.                    ",0
"Statistically, about 3,328 people die in fatal car crashes a year. About 421,000 gets injured in a car crashes a year. Phones are a major distraction for humans. Humans more attention to phones than any other other electronics. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because accidents can happen at any time, somebody can die from the person being on the phone while driving, and its illegal.

Being on the phone and driving is a very dangerous thing to do. Not only is it dangerous, it's also illegal in the many states of America. However,if people do their research and know that about 3,287 people die a day from crashes and 1,.25 billion people die a year from being on their phones. It would be necessary in this world to raise awareness of how serious this situation is especially for our younger audience 15-21. There is a purpose of life and you dont need to use that purpose to pick up your phone driving and end your life in a flash.

In addition, Driving comes with responsibility , You can't be on your phone while taking care of business because that's showing your to immature. Think of it like this , you dont want a pilot on his phone while flying a plane while your on it so it should be vice versa because thats playing with your life and the life of others. In fact, the evidence is Real . Thousands of reasearchers have been conducted around the world, and they all agree that use of mobile phones while driving is dangerous and pervasive. Researchers have guessed that 50 minutes' of Talking a month leads to a increase in the likelihood of a crash

In conclusion, humans should not drive while being on the phone. It's very dangerous and someone could get hurt or have a fatal injury. It's illegal in some states. Anything can happen while humans are on the phone and driving.   ",0
"Do you like the feeling of being told no to because you could not play sports? Its because your grades weren't good or because you cant play that good. Well we should be able to play sports with a C average cause at lease we are passing still. I think that the policy should change because kids could be really good at sports and u will never know until you let them play and see. C's are passing grades to me and my family but there not that great either cause u still need to pull them up and try and get a better grade before school gets out or u will be going to summer school.

Students who have C's want really like school that much cause they cant do there favorite things. School is not just about education its about doing what you want so that you can live the life you want. If you want to have a sports job like football, soccer or basketball, your going to have to start while your young. Students who make C's are still passing but they should be able to play sports still and have a life outside of school.

They might be good at sports and the coach might want them on the team but they cant cause of a C, that's not right they should be able to play cause like i said a C is not that bad at least there passing. Students with B's might not want to play sports and then if the students with C's does then they should be able to. The students are good either way but i could see if there all ways getting into trouble then they should not be able to play.

If the students that have C's and are constantly in trouble and gets more than 3 referrals then they should not be able to play. If the are good and they stay out of trouble then why cant they play sports. They should be able to participate in whatever they want.

This is why i am arguing against this because they are staying out of trouble and still passing the classes with a C average. So you should change the policy to because kids are good at sports and your not going to give them the opportunity to do so. Then they might even bring up there grades while playing sports.      ",0
"Students know their capabilities. During the summer some schools decide to make teacher give students summer projects, to help keep their mental capabilities up. While students may not like this whole process there has been discussion on whether or not they should be student or teacher designed.

Teacher may want to have them design them because they think students would make it extremely easy which is fair. Though I still believe that students should be the ones to design it. Some of the reasons being that they were already given tons by teachers, they need to be independent and also to make sure teachers don't worry they can make guidelines.

People have to know when to take a break. Students throughout the school year have been taught many things by teachers which we are very grateful for. Though with it we have been given hundreds of assignments and projects all made by different teachers. So instead of stressing during the long break they can finish the project at their own pace and even have fun with what they designed.

Making students do yet another teacher made project when it's supposed to be their break will not help the students out, it will mainly make them upset and think it's unfair. So to balance that out having them design their own project would make it more entertaining for them and less stressful so to speak.

Let them grow up. After each year of school is over they go onto the next, and during the summer they should be challenged with a self designed project to help them be more independent. With this they are able to get themselves mentally ready for the upcoming school year. Each year gets harder and being tasked with this will give them the experience of handling things alone and figuring out exactly how to manage it. Meaning that they will learn helpful skills about time management, responsibility, and independence. These also help them outside of school for certain situations like social events or job interviews when they need to be by themselves and they will know from this how to handle it accordingly.

Teachers are more experienced. With people that think that teachers are the best option for designing the project I do understand why. Students are young and may just want to take the easy route by not putting much effort into it. While teachers have experience making projects and understand just how hard each component will make it. So using a middle ground will help teachers let their kids be independent. By letting the teachers give students a guideline on what exactly the project should or should not have, will let them feel secure about them finishing it. The guideline would explain the things needed for it and how it should be graded, and letting students know how it will be graded will help immensely when design it.

It will also help the students to figure out ideas for their design instead of them just being completely out in the open. So making a guild line will make both the teacher and students feel more secure and confident in the project being designed and completed.

Schools have to understand students better. With summer based projects being designed by the students they are able to have some fun doing it while also learning skills that are needed for both in school and out. Doing so helps them learn how to be independent and makes it so teachers will let them as well. So I do think that summer projects should be made by the students, because it helps them to learn independence, know when to take a break, and then let teachers know that they can do it but a little help at the start doesn't hurt. ",0
"Only a small percentage of students don't already participate in extracurricular activities. Therefor, it shouldn't be required in schools. Some students don't have time to stay after school for sports or student council. School already gives students a lot of stress, especially trying to keep up with your classes and homework. The last thing a student needs is to miss school because of an injury from a sport. Students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because it causes more stress, students don't have time, or they could get injured.

School is already difficult with classes, homework, and drama. Some students don't want to have extra stress on them with sports or student council. Sports can also injure a student, causing them to miss school, which puts them behind in their classes and they have to make up the work. Doing homework is already stressful enough, students don't need to worry about going to practice, meetings, or games and then having to do their homework.

Some students are already in extracurricular activities, or sports outside of school. If they're already doing other activities outside of school that they're already dedicated to, why would you make them leave? As a student, doing softball outside of school is already enough to handle. I can't do something else for school because softball takes up most of my time. Students shouldn't have to worry about not having enough time to finish their homework because of having extracurricular activities shoved down their throats.

Injuries are one of the highest leading causes of students missing school, second only to sickness. Injuries from sports could also lead to future health issues. Making students participate in sports could make them more prone of injury. If a student gets injured they could miss school and get behind in their classes. Being behind in your classes leads to stress, stress leads to anxiety, anxiety leads to depression. ",0
"I dont think that FACS should be able to be used in classrooms to read students emotions. Students should be able to have the abilty to feel what they want not be told how they feel.

If we have FACS in the classrooms then the kids are going to be told what they feel and not learn what they are feeling on there own. If a student is sad but doesn't want everyone to know becase they dont want to talk about it then Facs would not give that student the space they need.

FACS is reading your emotions before you know what your emotions are. Its telling you that you will be sad before you know that you will be sad. Or if someone says something mean to you and you dont know how to feel about it FACS tells you to feel happy or sad or mad.

If you want privace then FACS takes it away by reading your face. it reads it and knows your mood. it can tell when you are mad at someone or sad about something. You cant get away from your emotions so FACS will always reed them.

In conclusin i dont thin FACS should not be able to be used in classrooms because it invades peoples privace and it tells student how they are feeling before they know.

"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education. Going to school now it is something that some teenagers do not considerate important student can take any class online.",0
"Here's why the author thinks Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus could of once been a Earth like planet. Venus is same size in density, and size as Earth. The planet had rocky sediments, craters, valleys, and mountains. But nobody can visit or get a up close look to venus because it has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide, highly corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. The weather is extremely hot the average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we are experiencing right now on earth this is stronger than any sea level on earth. If we were to have another pursuit to Venus it would not be efficient because we dont have the right equipment to survive on that kind of journey. No, the author did not evaluate his idea good enough there wasn't enough supporting details to support his claim ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"".",0
"People don't always make the right choice. Peoples opinions influence your decision making. Hearing another persons point of view is helpful. In your mind you have little voices that have an affect on your decisions. In my opinion, I like having more than one choice. Whenever I have to make an important decision I go and ask my friends for their opinion on the situation. I have been through some situations where I needed help from someone to help me decide what choice i should make. Peer pressure is a good example on making good choices. Imagine your in a room full of kids older than you, They ask you ""come try this drink"". You know your not old enough to be drinking, yet you still ask your friends if you should do it or not. All of your friends tell you ""No"" ,so you decide not to do it. Deciding on certain things isn't easy.

By getting someone else's point of view, You can look at things in a different way. If you don't ask for an opinion their could be a chance you could've done things differently. Imagine your finally going to buy the sneakers you've been wanting for a really long time. If one of your friends say they don't like them, then you start thinking about them in a different way, they changed your opinion right? Other peoples opinions will either affect your choices in a good way or a bad way. You have to keep in mind that your opinion is the one that matters the most.

If someone already went through what your going through then their opinion can make you decide things differently. If you have and older brother or sister they give you advice right? When they say stuff like ""trust me i know how it feels like"" it's because they don't want to see you go through the same thing as them. A lot of people have been in the same position as you once in their life, so why not go to them and ask them what they think. They can't go back and change what they did but they can advise you to do things differently. Their advice can help you make a good decision.

Having more than one persons opinion is very helpful. Everyone thinks differently and will help you make the right choice. Hearing multiple peoples opinions or thoughts can help you decide whether the choice your making is going to help you or not. Having multiple opinions from people can lead to making more thoughtful decisions. ",0
"Hi, my name is Decaon. And I work for NASA. I am here to discuss the face on mars. Many people think that it was created by aliens. But I am here to explain why it wasn't created by aliens.

The first photo was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Spacecraft. The craft was circleing Mars trying to find a spot for its sister ship to land. The Viking 2 Spacecraft. The first reason to why people think it is alien. Is the quality of the pictures that were taken. The first picture was taken in 1976 so the resolution of the picture wasnt very good. Which caused it to look like there was a nose, eyes and a mouth. But pictures that were taken years after show that it could have been the quality.

There is another reasonable explanation. During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow. But many still believe that it is alien. Even though this some of the best evidence to peove the face on mars isnt alien but a mistake.

But the most compelling reason is. It is simialr to some of the rock formations that we have on Earth. Scientist have found that in the western United States there are rock formations that are very similar. They are simailasr to the snake river palin in Idaho.

After a lengthy expalnation. I hoope i have provided enough facts to prove to you that. The face on Mars was not created by aliens. but created by an optical illusion. That are found on Earth as well as On Mars. And i hope This has been very informative for you.",0
"Homeschooling has become increasingly more common over the last few decades. Whether it is through taking courses online or sitting down with a teacher at home, many students have found success in this type of learning environment. All schools should consider implementing distance learning because it caters to the individual needs of students, allows for self-paced learning, and provides more time for students to complete extracurricular activities.

Nowadays, many people are realizing that the traditional public school environment does not work for everyone. Over time, more kids are developing social anxieties and fears that make it hard to attend school. Ultimately, these challenges interfere with learning. Students who suffer with social anxiety would be more comfortable learning in the security of their own home. They will be given the opportunity to learn in a calming environment, which will likely increase their grades and overall understanding of material. In addition, there are many students with learning disabilities who would also benefit from learning from home. Some students need extra help that they are not provided with in school. Even if all it takes to help students be more successful is a quick break every so often, distance learning provides that, unlike public school.

Another positive benefit of distance learning is that it allows for courses to be more self-paced. Often times at school, students find themselves doing work just to pass the time. When learning from their own home, students are able to get their work done fluently without wasting time. Likewise, the students who need additional time to review are given that opportunity as well. Sometimes in public school, teachers go too fast and leave students feeling confused and stressed. When learning from home, students are able to spend as much or as little time on concepts as necessary. This will help make sure all students are fully grasping the concepts taught in school.

Lastly, most students are involved in extracurricular activities. Kids participate in everything from sports to volunteering around the community. Many high school students even have jobs to help support their families or to save up for college. Most public schools last around seven hours each day. Then after school, students come home and complete their homework. With school taking up most of a students day, they dont have much time for extracurricular activities or hobbies. With distance learning, students will have a more flexible schedule. Many homeschooling opportunities allow for kids to complete their courses whenever they have time. This allows for students to spend more time doing things outside of school that make them happy. Some people may argue that public school is important because it is the place where students develop their social skills, however if students were provided with time for other activities, then public school would not be the only environment for social skills to develop.

Over the years, distance learning has, and will continue to, become significantly more common. Although it is not for everyone, all schools should offer it because different people thrive in different types of environments. Distance learning allows for students to spend the necessary amount of time on their courses and no more. As a result, students will have more time to send with loved ones or participating in sports and hobbies. Ultimately, students all over the world can benefit from distance learning.           ",0
"The effects of technology limiting human contact have been widely researched and debated. On one hand, technology has enabled people to connect from literally any corner of the world in an instant. Through social media and video-conferencing, family members who live far away can easily stay in touch, filling thousands of miles of physical space with the warmth of digital connection. In addition, with the rise of freelance work, more and more people have been able to turn their passions into professions without ever having to leave their homes; they can take on jobs located anywhere and communicate seamlessly to reach their goals. 

On the other hand, such restriction of human contact, while convenient, can also have its drawbacks. The loss of some in-person connections and social interactions has the potential to increase feelings of isolation and depression. In addition, digital contact does not always amount to satisfactory communication; meaningful conversations and emotional bonds can only truly be formed through face-to-face contact. Finally, the infiltration of technology into nearly every realm of our lives can lead to overstimulation and couldn’t-care-less attitudes, as people become too overwhelmed or desensitized to take action.",1
"Based on ideas and information in the article about advantages of limiting car usage, people are giving up their cars because of reasons such as, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in places where their reason for it is so they can experiment the outcome of it for a more secure data. Even though in the article it says that car ownership is allowed but, at the same time the amount of money for a parking place, $40,000, is way too much for people to afford. People also choose to live without an automobile because of how much it saves them in greenhouse gas, and other expensive things that car usage takes up. Experts and other people think that limiting the use of car transportation will make cities more denser, and will make it easier for everyone to get around without having issues. In some places, there are people who rather take a car wherever they go for better advantage, but in other places like in the United States, they are promoting ""car reduced"" communities, or for another example, in Paris, officials have ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Studies shows that in the U.S, Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and people are starting to not get their licenses as each year goes by. The populaton growth of the number of miles that people have driven in the U.S, the number has peaked in 2005, but then steadily dropped shortly after. Therefor, people are starting to take advantages of just walking or finding their own ride places to save them money. If you lived in Paris and got fined $31 for having an even numbered license plate, or on the other day got fined for an odd numbered license plate, walking or taking a different kind of transportation would probably be a good decision for you. In the outcome of that, the article states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to their fine. France has a policy that rates diesel fuel higher than gasoline and the results of that 67 percent of diesel vehicles were compared to 53.3 percent of diesel vehicles in all of Western Europe, this is all because of the ""Smog"". A thing called ""car-free day"" takes place in Bogota, Colombia, and in this situation, according to the article, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated and even took buses to all the places they had to be, which in return of that, the streets were left eerily devoided of all possible traffic jams. On this ""car-free"" day, car use is banned for the whole day leaving people with only having the choice of taxis and buses to take them to work, or anywhere else they had to be. Not to mention there are 7 million people who live in the certian place, so this makes this event more difficult for most people. One of the reasons for ""car-free"" day is to take away stress, and lower air pollution throughout all of Bogota, Colombia. Limiting car usage seems to be a good resourse, there could be some bad pieces to it but, in most cases i like the idea of saving money.     ",0
"Standardized testing has been a big part of our education system for a long time. But are they really accurate? I don't think so.

First of all, standardized tests only measure a narrow range of skills. They focus mostly on multiple choice questions that test our memory and basic comprehension. But there's so much more to learning than just remembering facts and figures. They don't take into account important skills like critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. These are the skills that we need to succeed in real life, but they're not reflected in standardized tests.

Another problem with standardized tests is that they're often biased. They're usually made by people who don't understand the experiences and backgrounds of all students. For example, a test question might assume that all students have access to a computer at home, but that's not always the case. Or, it might use language that's not familiar to students who are English language learners. This means that some students are at a disadvantage before they even start the test.

Furthermore, standardized tests put too much pressure on students. They're often used to determine important things like graduation, college acceptance, and even teacher evaluations. This makes students feel anxious and stressed, which can affect their performance on the test. It's not fair to judge students based on one test score, especially when there are so many other factors that can affect how well they do.

Finally, there are better ways to measure student ability. Alternative assessments, like project-based learning and portfolios, show a more complete picture of what students can do. These assessments allow students to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in a more meaningful way, and they're often more engaging for students.

In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They only measure a narrow range of skills, they're often biased, they put too much pressure on students, and there are better ways to assess student learning. Instead of relying so heavily on standardized tests, we should focus on alternative assessments that show a more complete picture of what students can do.",1
"Now, for some people, cars are a way of life. Nothing pleases them more than the feeling of a steering wheel on their hands, or the growl of a healthy engine. Those people probably could never live without their cars, but you probably can. Well, maybe not living without cars entirely, but at least reducing your use of them. It'll be a lot safer for the environment, and it'll cause a lot less traffic jams. So let's see why you can go a few more days without your prized Hoda Civic.

Now, you've probably had this fact jammed down your throat more times than you care to count, but, cars produce a lot of gas, which isn't really easy on the environment. According to the New York Times article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" And according to the Chicago Tribune article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter."" So, less car usage means less greenhouse emissions. Yes, there are cars out there that are more ""fuelefficient,"" but they still require lots of energy from the environment. Not only that, but using your car less often will mean that you won't have to deal with one of the biggest evils in the world.........traffic.

Now, think, when have you ever been stuck in traffic and actually enjoyed it? Now, if you were to ride a bicycle or take a subway, you wouldn't have to deal with that! Already, some cities around the world are finding alternative ways to avoid those jams. ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, tells of how the capital of Colombia is doing so. ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths...Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This means you'll be able to get to work or to that first date a lot quicker! Sure, people using less cars would strike a big blow in the automobile industry, but you don't neccesarily have to never drive a car again! What about on those long road trips, or when you have to carry a lot of passengers with you? A car would come in handy in such scenarios, but not neccesarily every scenario.

In summary, driving less would be more efficient because it means cleaner air and less highway congestion. So, after reading all of this information, do you think that you have what it takes to get from point A to point B without having to get into a driver's seat? can you take your hand off of the steering wheel long enough to open yourself up to other transportation options? Go ahead, try.",0
"Dear Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to perform community service. I feel that each student and their families have the right to not perform community service. But I do feel that one who performs community service should get some sort of reward. Maybe extra credit points or a party would be sufficient.

I think that students should have a choice of whether or not to perform community service, because I have experience with community service, and I find it rather boring and tiring. If they decide not to do it, they might not be well thought of, and that is their own problem. Another reason for why I think that the students and their families should have a choice on performing community service is because they might not be able to. Maybe a student's family does not own a car, and the work site is too far away to walk in a reasonable time. Or, someone in the family has died, and one parent has to work seventy-five hours a week, for a relatively low pay check. They also might be constantly busy, and just do not have the time for it.

I would probably be more inclined in performing community service with incentives. This would probably give the students more motivation, thus, more community work would get completed. If they offered extra credit, a party, or maybe a homework pass, more students would work for their community. In the long term, they might get used to it, and feel that life is missing something, and would perform community service more often.

The community service that the students perform, would also help students to grow closer to each other, and become mentally and sometimes physically stronger. It would also help the community. The students would be much more inclined to do it if some of the work that would need to be done directly benefited them, like a new park or skate park. This would not only help the community, but it would help the students too, whether the liked it or not, or even realized it, or not. The community would definitely realize it, and would feel much better about passing the world down to the next generation.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"In the United States of America, and all over the world, cars are used every day. People use them to get to work, to go see family, and to get simply, from A to B, but a new idea is sprouting up in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere where people are doing something unheard of.... giving up their cars. According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"",  Vauban, Germany is a city that is almost completely car free. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" THis shws that living without cars is not only possible, but could have some great consequences.

Living car free could seem like something impossible, but it has great effects. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a study ervealing that passenger cars are responsible for 12 peercent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe....and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Without cars, we could lower pollution, which is a huge problem for some places. In the second article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris has to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city after days of near-record pollution. Motorist with even number liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars on day and motorists with odd numbered plates were ordered to the next day. This enforcement had positive consequences along with it. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital and the smog hanging over the city eventually cleared. This shows almost immediate benefits to the decline in driving. Can you imagine the benefits after a long term period of car-free cities? The possibillities are limitless.

Car-free periods of time don't have to be long term. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day takes place every year and it is a ""big hit"" with millions of Colombians according to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". For the third straight year, cars have been banned only excluding busses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog in the city of 7 million. Anyone who violated the rules were fined 25 dollars. For the first time ever, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined in the event. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This should show that car free periods of time are possible, not matter how long, and that they have great consequences that come along with them.

You might say that it would be extremely difficult to make America a car free country. Well, according to a report in the fourth article ""The End of Car Culture"" America may be on it's way. Research studues show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The nummber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to a analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Thsi shows that there is a steady decline in driving and autiomotive transport in America. Also found in the fourth article, if the pattern persists, it will have beneficial impliactions for carbon emmisions and the enviorment. Many sociologists believe the pattern will continue. Alternate sources of transportation have popped up also. In New York, a new bike sharing program has popped up and in San Fransisco, Bay Arear Rapid Transit is another viable option of transport. With all of these options, doesn't one fit you?

In conclusion, alternate transport oppurtunities and car free periods of time are the solution. With so many ways to lower how much and how you drive. The switch to a more economic means of transport would be easier than you think. The possibillities are endless and multiple studies show that the good consequences outweigh the bad ones. One question is yet to be asked, are you ready to make the switch to the better way of tansport?                                                                                                               ",0
"Hoping for a mere 538 people to vote for our nations president seems like an unfair way of voting. The Electoral College is a process of voting in which 538 electors vote for the new president for our nation, where 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Which ever elective has the most votes from states is the winner.

I believe that if the Electoral College was abolished, then we can have a more fair way of voting. Sure, The electoral college has some perks like a certainty of outcome, but there is more negatives on keeping it. If we got rid of the Electoral College for good and replaced it for a classic ""most-votes wins"" election then the nation can have a clear view to who their votes go to. This way, votes aren't decided by popular electoral votes.

The president should win over the most of our country with good qualitys that people want to see. People need to open their eyes and see ""When you vote for a candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" (Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College) If you vote for your favorite candidate you are voting for the state to win by popular vote. We should keep it simple. Add up everyones vote for whom they voted, and who ever has more votes wins.

""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.    ",0
"Electoral college should be banned. Many people say that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close elction in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. So let me give you some facs about why electoral college should be banned.

Furthermore,Another reason why electoral college should be banned is because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kery.

For Instance,Another reason why electoral college should be banned is because legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people back in 1960,.Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

In Conclusion,I think electoral college should be banned because its unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. So this is why electoral college should be banned.                                                                                                                                                                                                              ",0
"Dear Principle

I believe that ""policy 2"" is not such a good idea because students will bring their phones to school no matter what and will disobey your idea of not bringing their cell phones. Policy 1 in my opinion is a great idea because student will b allowed to talk to there friends or call home in case of an emergency they have. When students walk into class they should place their phones in a bucket so they wont b able to use them or have the teacher make sure their phones or turned off and put of way.

The cell phone policy in schools are one of the most biggest concerns to teachers because mostly in every class there is always a student guy or girl using their cell phone to communicate with their friends to talk. this is why letting students use their cell phones during there free time in school is a good idea so they can have time to talk and text to their friends and talk what they want to talk about so they can pay attention during class instead of texting their friends during class to talk and instead pay attention.

All though policy 2 isn't such a good idea but it will teach the students to not text during school. School is to learn not to socialize only on their personal time they can. students become less smarter because they are distracted by using their cell phone to talk during school and that's how they never learn. students need to learn that there is more to life then just texting and talking on their cell phones.",0
"Driverless cars aren't a new topic to the automotive world. They weren't as advanced as they were now, but now they're much more advanced and more practical. Since we're in the modern era I can fully understand why people just want to hurry to make cars that drive themselves, but it just doesn't seem very practical. Driverless cars would have more faults than benefits to the road.

People just want to upgrade everything without seeing the faults in evolving. For example, the car still needs a driver to manage it, so why do you need to upgrade if it doesn't even fulfill its own namesake? The limited automotive use really just puts the driver at more risk, because of the possibility of a malfunction. On that note since the cars are lined with high tech equipment, and whatnot wouldn't the accident in that kind of vehicle be more severe? Something could explode, and injure much more than the drivers. This also would make one of these cars far more difficult to replace as it states in the article. With it being filled with sensors, and other high tech equipment this could lead to 100's of thousands of dollars being thrown out the window for repairs.

In the end the benefits of having a driverless car are outweighed by the faults.

The call is still pretty tough, since the idea is still underexplored as a whole. For all we know the problems could get worked, but manual cars won't become obsolete. Manual cars still retain the more benefits in my mind.   ",0
"Dear Principal i thing every student should do some community serves. Because instead of wasting their time staying home and playing video games, watching T.V they could be helping other people that need their help. They could at least help clean up the park by picking up trash and recycle plastic water bottles. They play in the park to so they should help clean it in keep it nice. Or they could help at a shelter helping people that need food or cloths. Since they live in this community i think they should help it in take part in it. They could also help a small kid by tutoring them in help them understand something they don't get at school. they shouldn't be foolish and help around because helping around in our community is very important. Even if they only do it for a few hours at least they did something that made the community better. Just by giving a little pit of there time to do something help full. By doing it makes you feel good about our selves knowing that you did something good. it also teach us a lessen not to be foolish and help out ones a wile.",0
"My principal recently decided that all students should participate in an extra curricular activity, and I totally agree. I think every student should participate in an activity like sports, a musical in s trument class, or some sort of club. This would help students to learn and develop talents and skills. Also it would give students a time to socialize with people. So, I think the principals's idea was great and it helps students learn and grow and gives time to socialize.

If students do after schools activities like sports they will be able to exercise and practice coordination with friends. Sports will make students to grow to strong and get lots of sunlight. Learning an instrument has been proven to make people smarter. But not just in music, in other curriculum too. Also there is a lot of different clubs out there that can help people with getting jobs or just learn a hobbie too.

One big thing that I will really like about this is that it gives students more time to socialize mwith friends. This will also give practice of big social skills you will use through your life. These skill will help get jobs for students later in their life. With an extra hour or two to spend time with peers and teachers they will get alot of practice. But most of all give students a fun time after spending all their day at school.

So in conclusion, the principals decision on students participating in extra curricular activities would good for me and my peers. It will give students time to develop and grow their skills, like coordination, knowledge of a topic or hobbies. Also it would give students time to socialize, grow social skills and have fun. So in the end the principals decision is great. ",0
"I am in favor of stricter gun control laws. The reason is simple, we need to protect our communities and families from gun violence. It's a common sense approach that will help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those who are mentally unstable.

Firstly, stricter gun control laws would help reduce the number of mass shootings that occur. We have seen too many tragedies in schools, movie theaters, and other public places where innocent people are killed or injured by guns. By making it harder for people to obtain firearms, we can reduce the likelihood of these types of incidents happening.

Secondly, background checks should be mandatory for all gun purchases. This way, people with criminal records or mental health issues won't be able to buy guns. It's a simple solution that can make a big difference in preventing gun-related crimes.

Lastly, we need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. These types of weapons are designed for military use and have no place in civilian life. They are responsible for many of the mass shootings that have occurred in recent years, and banning them would be a step towards reducing gun violence.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are necessary to protect our communities and families from gun violence. By implementing these laws, we can reduce the number of mass shootings, prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, and ban weapons that have no place in civilian life. It's time for us to take action and make our communities safer.",1
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of implementing a four-day work week in schools:

Hey, so like, have you heard about this thing where schools might start having a four-day work week? I know, it sounds kinda weird, but I think it could be pretty cool. I mean, think about it, we'd have more time to hang out with our friends, do stuff we like, and just chill. But, there are also some pretty big pros and cons to it, so we gotta think about that too.

First of all, let's talk about the good stuff. If schools had a four-day work week, we'd have more time to do stuff outside of school. Like, I love playing video games and watching YouTube videos, and with an extra day off, I could do that even more. Plus, my parents are always bugging me to help with chores and stuff, and with an extra day, I could get more stuff done without feeling so overwhelmed. And, let's be real, who doesn't love having an extra day to sleep in and relax? It's like, the best.

But, there are also some pretty big cons to it. Like, teachers and other staff members might not be super happy about it. They might have to work longer hours on the days they are in school, which could be pretty tough. And, some people might be worried about how it could affect their grades and stuff. I mean, if we're not in school as much, might we not learn as much? That's a pretty big concern.

And, there's also the thing about money. I know schools need money to run and stuff, and if they have a four-day work week, they might not have as much money to spend on things like supplies and stuff. That could be pretty bad.

So, like, overall, I think a four-day work week in schools could be pretty cool, but we gotta think about all the pros and cons and make sure it's gonna be good for everyone. I mean, we don't want teachers and staff to be super stressed out or for students to not learn as much. It's like, a pretty big decision",1
"When most people are stuck, whether it be in a video game or in real life scenarios, they need to ask for advice. Advice is very helpful in guiding someone along their way, or help them make decisions. Most people also ask multiple people for advice. I believe that asking multiple people for advice is good because you get to know the consequences, you know a little bit more and if you get opposing viewpoints, you can use those to think about your decision.

Knowing the consequences of your actions can be a huge advantage, as every action has its consequence. Many people tend to ignore the consequences to their actions and end up in bad predicaments. When you ask for advice, you are also learning about your actions, and how your choices impact your life. Hopefully, knowing the pros and cons can help with choices and problems.

Knowledge is power, and the more you have, the better. Sometimes, when you get advice from just one person, they tend to leave out important details. When we get advice from multiple people, other people might cover the topics that the other did not. Occasionally, that information would be crucial, and could have prevented disasters, so you have to ask multiple people when getting advice.

One part of making choices involve weighing out the pros and cons. If you get advice from two people with opposing viewpoints, you could get more information about the consequences. With that information, you can consider the choice more and make the right decision. Decisions are hard, but asking multiple people can be helpful.

Advice can be more helpful if you take it from more than one person and interpret it right. In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is beneficial, because you get to know the consequences, you know a little bit more about the problem, and if you get opposing viewpoints, you can use those to think about your decision. ",0
"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research different career paths and pick one that interests me. Like, there are so many options out there, it's crazy! But, I decided to focus on the medical field because, honestly, I'm really into science and helping people.

So, I looked into different careers in the medical field and made a list of options. There's like, doctor, nurse, pharmacist, physical therapist, and so many more! Each one of them has their own skills and qualifications that are necessary to succeed. For example, doctors have to go to med school for like, forever, and nurses have to get a degree in nursing. Physical therapists have to do a bunch of school too, but it's not as long as med school.

But, out of all the options, I think I want to be a physical therapist. I mean, they help people who are injured or have disabilities, and they work with them to get better. It's like, really cool to see people recover and get back to their normal lives. Plus, it's not as long of school as med school, so that's a plus.

So, to become a physical therapist, I'll need to get a degree in physical therapy. I'm thinking of going to college for like, four years, and then doing a graduate program for another two years. That way, I'll have my undergrad degree in something like biology or psychology, and then my graduate degree in physical therapy.

I'm also thinking of doing some internships or volunteer work in the medical field to get some experience. That way, when I go to apply to physical therapy school, I'll have some stuff to put on my application. Plus, it'll be really helpful to get some hands-on experience before I start school.

Anyway, that's my plan for now. I'm really excited to start this journey and see where it takes me! (Sorry, I know this essay was super long, but I just got really into it!)",1
"In the 21st century, technology has drastically changed the way humans communicate and interact with each other. Access to laptops, tablets, and smartphones have made it easier and faster to communicate with others, which has proven to be both a positive and a negative aspect of technology. On one hand, communication has become more efficient with the ability to instantly get in touch with anyone, anytime. On the other hand, spending too much time on technology can lead to reduced social interaction and even vision problems, due to the reliance on screens. 

Additionally, technology has had a major impact on libraries and their role in society. As the majority of people now have access to digital books and other forms of media on the internet, fewer people visit libraries. Librarians have had to adapt to this changing trend and redirect their attention to providing other services such as educational programs, or hosting events like music performances.

Considering the negative effects of increased technology usage, it is important to limit the time spent on technology and find a healthy balance. It can be helpful to set boundaries and limit the amount of time spent on screens daily. Additionally, we should give ourselves the chance to connect with others face to face, as meaningful interactions are fundamental for our social development.",1
" I concur with Author Emerson because individuals have the freedom to pursue their own happiness, beliefs, and values without fear of judgment or retribution. Emerson's statement emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's individuality in a world that often tries to shape and mold people to fit certain standards or expectations. While it is natural for people to strive to improve themselves and seek validation from others, I believe that those who choose to remain true to themselves and their own unique identity are the ones who truly succeed in life.

By being authentic and unapologetic about who they are, individuals can inspire others to follow in their footsteps and embrace their own individuality. This can be especially powerful in a world where many people feel pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations. By standing out and being true to themselves, individuals can show others that it is possible to live a fulfilling and meaningful life without sacrificing their own identity.

Furthermore, I believe that it is important for individuals to speak up for themselves and their own beliefs, even if it means going against the majority. While it can be intimidating to stand up for what you believe in, it is ultimately empowering and can lead to personal growth and fulfillment. By standing up for themselves, individuals can gain confidence and self-respect, which can help them to achieve their goals and live a more authentic and fulfilling life.

In conclusion, I believe that Emerson's statement about the importance of individuality and authenticity is highly relevant and applicable to our modern world. By remaining true to themselves and their own beliefs, individuals can achieve success, inspire others, and live a more fulfilling and authentic life.",1
"Politics is everywhere and it rules our everyday lives. Each United States citizen has a role in choosing how our politics can operate. It might not be a huge role but it definitely is an important small role. The presidential election happens every four years on the first tuesday of November. There is an electoral college which is the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizens. As state senator, I think you should keep the electoral college running because it is a safer option than just doing election by popular vote.

The electoral college consists of professionals in congress that are more specialized in politics then an average citizen is. The electoral college should be handed the trust to control our politics. There must be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect that President. Each candidate running for president must have his or her own electoral group. The electors are chosen by the candidates political party, which means the person running for President if in good hands with his electoral college.

Al Gore lost the presidency, but he won the popular vote. Maybe the professionals in the electoral college saw a flaw in him that the average citizen would not see. 60% of people prefer doing the direct election popular vote. The direct election would only satisfy themselves temporarily, but what if this president that got elected put the whole country in a downfall. Then people would realize how important the electoral college is.

There are some cases where the election process ends up being a disaster. What if citizens weren't able to chose the electors and the state legislatures were fully in charge of choosing those electors. Well, the electors can still chose to go by what the people want. In 1960, the segregationist almost replaced Democratic electors with the new electors that opposed John F. Kennedy. Some electors have even went against their political party's candidate and only choose who they wanted to chose. The segregationist that were in power at that time only wanted what they thought was best for them and not what was best for the people. Situations like this must require the votes and thoughts of the average citizens combined with the electoral college.

The electoral college has voters voting for electors only and not the president. The electoral college should stick around forever. Popular votes might not always be the best option. The citizens still have a say in which electors shall be chosen and that plays a part in electing the president. Even though voters are not always able to control who the electors vote for, they still have a part in chosing who will be president.",0
"As you know, as a scientist we come across many misunderstandings. The ""Face"" on Mars is one of them. This landform was created by natural causes; saying that it was created by a differrent lifeform is irrelavent. It's irrelavent because NASA would have a higher budget than we do now to explore further, if you take a look at the pictures the three are very distinct, and the third photo didn't show any other landforms, pyramids, houses, or lifeforms.

NASA's budget is assgined to them by the new discoveries they find in outter space. If there were alien life on planet Mars we would've told the public, federal government, etc. because we want that extra money to discover more about it. Why would just hold on to that secret. We took a pictures of the landforms lets see how they turned out.

As we compare the pictures of the same landform there are many differences. The 01' picture we took has multiple cracks and craters in the monument. I'm pretty sure the aliens wouldn't bulid a monument some place it could get beat up at. The 76' and 98' pictures were captured with not too good of a camera, causing it to have the appearance of a face.

In 2001, we had created a camera with the highest camera quality we were able to obtain. We researched and studied on the camera itself to see that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of 43 like the other cameras. We came to the conclusion that we would be able to see any other landforms, lifeforms, ships, etc. ,but all of the above are absent.

In conclusion, there was not any life shown on the picture, so it's irrelavent that aliens created it. We visit our monments. Why were there no aliens visiting thiers? One answer, they didn't bulid it.",0
"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldn't do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you aren't benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives.

One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well.

A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that won't be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I don't make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesn't come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there won't be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well.

One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people don't seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well.

In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyone's day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication.",0
"What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.

Some ways you might like this is that. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.

How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. However if it's not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people.

Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.

So now that you know how to do this it say do it. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. If it's happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it.",0
"We as Americans have the right to vote for who we want to be president. American citizens should be able to vote directly for the president, not for a state of electors. This is why we need to abolish the Electoral College. It is unreasonable, unfair, and unreliable to the people. In recent times, the Electoral College has been known to have made mistakes on purpose and on accident. The Electoral College system that they have going now is very unorganized and needs to be changed. It is about time that we change the way our citizens vote for our president. This is a huge deal to our country considering the fact that the president is one of the most important people in the country. We as American citizens should be able to trust that our vote was for the candate they chose.

First of all, lets discuss the past issue that have happened withe Electoral College system. The incident in 1960 with John F. Kennedy was a huge disaster. As said in source 2 ""...The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This is a perfect example of how the Electoral College is a misused way of voting. They tried to basically sabotage Kennedy's election. What about other problems that also occur with this system? The voters can't always control who their electors vote for. The confusion is a big key factor in the situations also. voters can easily get confuse about the electors and they will accidentally vote for the wrong candidate.

The peoples rights. Dont they have a right of who becomes president? They should. The Electoral College is taking away from the excitement of getting to make a huge decision on who will run the country. When a teenager finally becomes eighteen, what do you think is on their mind? Freedom. And part of getting their freedom is getting to vote for their country. The people should have the right to vote for whoever they may choose and trust that it went for the person they chose and not to a state of electors to vote for them. It's in the facts that more people prefer to have a direct election. The people think that it is unfair to their rights and we all believe that it is not the best way to decide who runs our country.

Organization is a key factor in this country. So why aren't we showing it? The voting system that we use to this day is very unorganized and has many flaws. The Electoral College is much to confusing of a system that we need to be using. We need to change our system now while we can before we hit another mistake. We need to take advantage of the freedom that we have in this country of ours and make a difference. We can change this system so it is much easier and more reliable to vote from. The people want it, so it's about time that the government stands up and agrees with us on that point. We can change our disorganization.

Our country needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I have discussed the problems our country has faced with Electoral College system, and hopefully it changes your view on what really is the right and better thing to do for our country. Voting is a very big deal here in America and it is one of the ways it shows we have freedom. The voting system would be much more organized if the system were changed to direct vote by the people. That is the right way. Its about time we change the system for the better.",0
Teachers should not be able design the students project because the students might have have trouble on the assignment the teacher gives them over the break and they wont be able to get help because the teacher and the students will be on break and it will make it hard for the students to finish the work and if students choose what they want to do for their project it will be easy and understandable for them and they can do a lot of research on what they they do on their project and when the students get to do what they want n the project they can get good credit on the assignment if the teacher gets to choose what the student does on there project then then the students will have a hard time thinking and coming up with ideas for there assignment and probably wont do good on the project and fail if students get to design what they want to do on there project then there creativity will go up and the way they think will be different and if they design it themselves then they will be more intrested in the assignment then if the teacher did designed it then the students would probably wont do the assignment.,0
"Dear, senator I hereby to inform you that I'm in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United Staes, the kind we have now. For many reasons we believe the Electoral College should be abolish due to the process of electing the next president. During the Electoral College voters tend to vote but, not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn to elect the president. We believe that over 60 percent of voters would prefer an election the kind we have now, as I said before. As you know the Electoral College consist of 538 electors, making it a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Californa, making it the state with the most electoral votes, is a state that could rise a candidates votes, and is considered by the following candidates that California could be an enormous help for the candidate. Many voters have many questions regarless to the Electoral Vote, for example; can voters control whom, their electors vote for? Nor who picks the electors in the 1st place?, These are a few questions that many voters have. I believe we should forment and focous more on the popular vote of those who are qualified citizens. The biggest disaster with the electoral college was when the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, therefore making state legislatures responsible for picking electors. During an electoral college vote, if the electoral vote ends in a tie, the election would be held in the House of Reprsentatives, whereas state delegations would vote on the president. Candidates don't get to spend time in the states they know, having a chance of not winning. As a result of that, in the 2000 campaign, approximately seventeen states didn't have the oppurtunity to see the candidates. On the other hand the electoral college avoids the problem of elections. Therefore i considerate the electoral collge vote unfair to voters.    ",0
"As students approach the end of their high school years, the pressure to identify a career path and make decisions about their future can be overwhelming. However, I believe that students should not be expected to have a clear idea of their future career by the time they enter high school. Instead, it would benefit them to wait until their junior year to start planning their future.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that students are still developing and exploring their interests and abilities. High school is a time for students to try new things, take on different challenges, and discover what they are passionate about. By not being expected to identify a career path early on, students are given the opportunity to explore a wider range of options and make more informed decisions about their future.

Secondly, the job market is constantly changing and evolving. New technologies and industries are emerging all the time, and it is impossible to predict what opportunities will be available in the future. By waiting until their junior year to start planning their future, students can take advantage of the latest information and resources to make more informed decisions about their career path.

Finally, waiting until their junior year to start planning their future allows students to take advantage of the resources and support available to them. High schools often offer career counseling and other resources to help students explore their options and make informed decisions about their future. By waiting until their junior year to start planning, students can take advantage of these resources and ensure that they are making the best decisions for their future.

In conclusion, I believe that students should not be expected to identify a career path by the time they enter high school. Instead, it would benefit them to wait until their junior year to start planning their future. By doing so, students can take advantage of the opportunities and resources available to them, explore a wider range of options, and make more informed decisions about their future.",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME's:

I wonder why we don't get to use phones in schools i got to reasons why we should use them my two reasons are?

my first reason is that just like working adults students need a break from sitting in a boring class all day working and studying and taking quiz's to alot of students in the united states cell phones is are way of communicating with people and each other we should be able to talk on are cell phones at lunch to kind of take away the stress we have in the classrooms.

my second reason i think we should have cell phones is because it keeps occupied so you don't fall into any trouble it is the backbone to a teens society it also helps teens with there communicating skills and helps us talk better. and that's why i think we should have phones during are free time lunch periods,breaks,library. etc.

well i told you my two reasons why i think students should be allowed to have phones at school and on school facilities.",0
"Many people face the difficult decision of choosing a career at a young age, and it can certainly be beneficial to start taking steps in a desired direction at a young age. For example, I know a teenaged girl who is already learning valuable skills in coding, which could give her an edge in future job markets. However, some argue that deciding a career path at an early age can lead to regret or lack of opportunity further down the line. Those who wait until later in life to get a degree or who change fields as they age often have a well-rounded understanding of the world and their particular interests, and can find more fulfilling work. My grandmother, for example, devoted most of her twenties to travel and charity work, and decided later to pursue a career in the art world. In conclusion, while it is possible to find success by selecting a career at a young age, it can also be beneficial to wait until later in life to gain a better understanding of the world and one's passions.",1
"Have you ever been in a sticky situation, and needed some strong advice? I assume you went and talked to more than one trusted person. If you didn't I'll tell you why you should have. When seeking for advice you should talk to more than one person because, there will be a variety of opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and the people giving advice can share many experiences, not just one.

When many people are asked to give advice, there will be a variety of opinions. That means everyone will have a different point of view on the issue or situation. The multiple opinions makes it better for you to receive advice. One individual's standpoint is bias, because they only believe in one thing. On the other hand, many individuals' standpoint isn't bias, the reason being : everyone thinks different.

People are human, they make mistakes and errors, but we wouldn't be able to learn and grow without them. Just learning from your own mistakes is helpful, but imagine learning from multiple people and their mistakes. You might not even realize how learning from the mistakes of people is such a habit. For example if you're walking on the street and see someone trip on a pothole, you obviously are going to know not to trip on the pothole. Another example for instance is if you know someone that made friends with an unkind person, most likely you would stay away from that person. Just think about how you could avoid making a ton of mistakes by listening to others and their accidents.

If you seek advice from a person, they are probably wiser and more experienced. It's common sense why you get advice from someone older, wiser, more experienced, or smarter than you. A five year old most likely couldn't give outstanding advice to a twenty year old. One wise statement of advice could get someone far, but multiple wise statements from many people is much better.

The final verdict is that it is much better to seek advice from many people, compared to only one or just yourself. You will have a variety of options and opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and you can get advice from people with different experiences. So next time you're stuck in a sticky situation and you don't know what to do, think about getting advice from multiple people.                  ",0
"No they should not use the technology in class rooms because thats a invashion of pricicy. And they dont need to know every little thing going on in our lives. Becouse every one need there privicy and if schools use that technology there taking that away completly. And why would you use that in a class room any way to spy on people thats a little creepy you know and also why would the teacher even what that becouse thats looking at them too. So there for in my choice the technology is not valuale and should not be put into classrooms or anywhere for that matter becouse every needs that privcy and no one will be able to get that if that technology is around. Another reason we should have it is becouse why would you want people to know your exact emotions anyways if they can read your emotions they can pretty much tell what your thinking by that.

So that is the reaons I think we should not have the facial action coding systems.",0
"dear, principal i agree with policy 1its perfect i think you should allow student to use there cell phones in launch period and any free time but have them completely turn of during class because its not like the cell phone is a bomb or anything its just a cell phone, also cell phones do come in handy like in a case of an emergence during school , and i think its fun to use your cell phones burring your free time and enjoy it!!

i don't get how teachers are so uptight about having cell phones in school they act like its a bomb or something its not! its just a cell phone. i think if you would choose policy 1 student will respect it and only have there cell phones on during free time or lunch think there is no reason for school not to allow student with cell phone to me this makes no sense cell phone can come in handy one day in school for a student for an example a student can be feeling bad during launch and needs to go home the student can call home and have a parent pick them up.

most of all i think its fun that a student can use there cell phones burring launch or free time because you can text you friends that are on the other side of the lunch room and ask them of they want to have lunch together its so cool and exciting and there is no harm in doing that its not bad or mean so i don't understand why teachers are to strict with cell phones.

well i hope you do choose policy 1 because students would love that and enjoy it much more and to me i think student would be more relaxed and not worried about there cell phones getting taken away for no reason and i think even parents would very much like this idea as well because they don't have to be coming to school all the time to get there child's cell phone from the office.",0
"For students, summer projects can feel like a lot, summer break is supposed to be filled with fun times and vacations while projects are almost the exact opposite. Removing summer projects all together isnt an option, so when it comes to the question ""should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed"" teacher-designed projects reign supreme, as it benefits both the student and the teacher in multiple different ways.

As a teacher, your main job is proving students with a learning experience that will help them grow as people. Having a student design a summer project would not be nearly as powerful as the impact a teacher-designed project would. Teachers are well informed and know a lot more than most students and because of this it is their responsibility to provide a student with a project rather then have them create one themselves. This is especially reinforced in younger children, such as grades k-6, as they still need a lot of direction and having a student-designed project would not be as viable or coherent as a teacher-designed project.

Teachers have it difficult sometimes, as they are trying their best to provide students with a learning experience, but teachers also deserve to have their job be a little easier. Creating a teacher-designed project as opposed to a student-designed one, would be far easier to grade and create a rubric for. In student-designed projects you have a lot of variety and no one follows a central guideline, however in a teacher-designed project, you can maintain the variety but also contain a set of rules that benefits both the students and teachers, as the students have more clearly defined rules to guide and provide structure to their projects. This also benefits the teachers, as they can easily grade the assignment and provide a fair grading experience.

Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects. Teachers will always design something challenging and beneficial to the students education. Students, especially younger ones, cannot be trusted to design a project that would be as beneficial as a teacher-designed project. Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy. A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person.

Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart. Because of that, when it comes down to it, teacher-designed projects are generally more helpful, easier, and responsible then a student-designed project would be.",0
"Why does electoral college still have its defenders, Abolish the electoral college!... Electoral College was a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I am writing to the state senator of florida to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I am certain that we should keep the eletoral college because of three simple reasons. The Electoral College is a way of certainty of outcome. Swing states, and to Aviod run-off elections.

To commence I say the system of electoral college should stay because it has a certaint of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. This has happened before in 2000. In 2012 election, for Obama he received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. electoral votes arenon a winner-takes-all basis. A tie in the nationwide electora vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number.

To continue the second reason why I think th electoral votes should stay is becasue of sing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Last but not least electoral voting should stay because to aviod run-off elections. The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes.

To briefly wrap up I argue in favor for the Electoral Votes to stay because of the certainty of outcome, swing states, and lastly to aviod run-off elections. In some people's opinion's they would disagree, but they will not have enough facts to support why they disagree, because honestly Electoral Votes is always the way to go.              ",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons: certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, attention to swing states, balance between small and large states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

One practical reason for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Although disputes over the electoral vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's text, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system ensures that the candidate who wins the presidency has a clear majority in the Electoral College, creating stability and certainty in the outcome of the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This requirement eliminates the possibility of a candidate with only regional appeal becoming president, which could lead to feelings of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions. By requiring candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters, the Electoral College promotes more balanced and effective presidency.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, as described by Judge Richard A. Posner. Candidates are incentivized to campaign heavily in states where the outcome is uncertain, leading to more engagement with voters in these states. These voters are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and carefully consider the candidates' messages and policies. By giving these thoughtful voters the opportunity to decide the election, the Electoral College ensures that the most informed and engaged citizens have a significant say in choosing the president.

The Electoral College also balances the political weight of large and small states. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the malapportionment of the Senate gives more weight to small states. The Electoral College provides a counterbalance by giving large states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as larger states have a greater number of electoral votes. This balance ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are taken into account in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity and uncertainty of the election process, as demonstrated by the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, who both won a majority in the Electoral College despite having only a plurality of the popular vote. By consistently producing a clear winner, the Electoral College streamlines the election process and avoids additional rounds of voting that could potentially prolong the transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved due to its practical benefits. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the political weight of small and large states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for a popular vote system, the Electoral College's advantages make it a crucial aspect of our democratic process. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear, senator I believe the electoral college was a useful tool in the past ,but is now an out date system that should be changed. If we continue to use this system we aren't really giving the people a fair chance to vote for who they want. For example in California a more democratic state republicans may be lessen the incentive to vote knowing that there vote will not have an effect. This raise another issue, which is not everybody is voting and it is not all a right but a prestige among US citizens every where. The electoral college was elective in the past because we did not have the technology to count all the votes from each state, but now we do so we can only go by the popular vote.

The popular vote is more effective and I'm not the only one who thinks so over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Al Gore thanks to the electoral college won the popular vot but lost the electoral, how is it that some one could win more votes from most voters ,but still lose? The answer is the electoral college, the reason is that you are not voting as a indiviual person but as a state. This brings me back to California and how republicans votes don't count because the state voted democrat.

Though the electors should do there job and vote with the state they could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationist nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So please take into consideration that your vote may not have an effect on the election if we don't change the system.",0
"A good attitude is one of the most important things in life, because when you talking or do something with the best attitude you can see how everything is going great, and people feels good and comfortable with you. In the same time, it can open a lot of doors for you, and it can be a good opportunity for be a successful.

On the other hand, people believe that have a good attitude all the time is not a good idea, because some people will make use you, but most of the people who think like that don't have a success life; most of that people in the future feel depressing, feels like they don't do nothing with you life, they are not sucessful, and is something that every person needs thing about, you need prove that you can do it, that you can be a professional, and that you are more than people thing of you, because you need show people that is nothing imposible in life, that all your goals and dreams can makes real.

For example, a person work in a restaurant and you have a good attitude with the customers, you make them feel like in home, not waiting too long for their drinks and food, you will show them that you really happy for have them in there; in the other side, a person who works in the restaurant, don't smile to the customer, make they feel uncomfortable, and don't care about their drinks and food they don't going back to the restaurant or don't choice you for be their waitress, because you don't have a good attitude with your customers.

Also, make yourself a successful person, a person who the people want to talk, a person who a company want to you for work there, a person who do all ther goals and dreams, and a person who love himself, because you got love yourself, respect yourself, and try your best every single day, that is really impotant in your life. The attitude make you go for the best or wrong way, the best give you the best opportunity for a successful person; however, the bad give you the the work in where you do feel good, and where the best part of your day is when you go to the bathroom and use you phone for a couple minutes, when you got to life for check to check, that is the life of people who think the attitude is no the key of success, everyone don't reserve that, they reserve be happy, and have a good life with the people they love.

Is the same way in shool, talking about teacher and students, ""respect if you want respect back"", most of the students always have attitute with their teacher, they never respect them, but they want respect, a good attitude in school is the best thing we can do, because the teacher will help you more if they see you respect and really want to work, you are the person who need good grades, if you have a good attitude you will se the process in your life, in your classes, and your home. Also, in home, their parents need show and teach their kids that the attitude is the key of life, that they need have a good attitude if they want to be a good person in the future, that they want to be a professional, and be better person everyday, they will think on that, they will ask themselves why their parents try teach them that the attitude is important, and they will tray to have a good attitude for be a successul person.

In conclusion, the attitude is the key that will open all the doors you want, thats no matter what problems you have, when you do something you need doing with the best of you attitude, all is going to be perfect when you got a good attitute with people and with yourself. Try and see how your life is going for a straight way. They will enjoy their life, be happy with themselves and with the people around them, is all about how you acting, how you express yourself, and the way you talking with people, every person need make a different and show to everyone that the attitude is important to life, they will learn if the see that most of the people is doing it, try to make a different and see how everythinh is change for you. All is based on you.",0

"Bonjour! 

For my essay, I will be researching the tourist attractions in France, the types of cuisine you can expect to find, and what to expect in terms of weather and people. 

First off, let's talk about the tourist attractions in France.  There are so many amazing places to visit in France!  From the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris to the beautiful beaches of the French Riviera, there's something for everyone.  Did you know that the Louvre Museum in Paris is home to the Mona Lisa?  It's true! And the Notre-Dame Cathedral is just as impressive. 

Next up, let's talk about the food in France.  Oh, the food!  France is known for its exquisite cuisine, which includes escargots, ratatouille, and croissants.  And have you heard of macarons?  They're these delicious little meringue-based cookies that are to die for!  But honestly, the food in France is just... wow. 

Now, let's talk about the weather in France.  Well, it's... um...  France has a temperate climate, which means it can be quite chilly in the winter and warm in the summer.  But hey, at least it's not as hot as... um...  Some places.  And did you know that France is home to some of the most beautiful countryside in Europe?  The rolling hills and vineyards are just... 

Finally, let's talk about the people of France.  The French are known for their... um...  hospitality?  They're so friendly and welcoming",1
"Dear principal

I choose policy 1, because there is know reason to make us have to put our phone away when we aren't doing anything like lunch break, before school, while we are changing classes.

The best time for the cell phones are during lunch because most of the people don't eat the lunch food or they are shy and only talk to certain people.... Everyone has a cell phone, and all the teachers know when we are in the hall way we are going to pull them out. Most kids pull them out when the teachers are not look or don't think they are looking...

Some teachers don't like cell phones so bad that if the see it in the there pockets they try to take it.

When the principles take the phone they will try to make u wait until the parents get there but by that time the kids have convinces the parents that the teacher took it for know apparent reason. Then the parents get mad at the teachers. The principal starts getting all kinds of phones calls and complaints all because the teacher took the cell phone.

I know your thinking im just an 8th grader wanting to use my cell phone anytime i want to but its not like that al all. I fell its a very good reason why we should get to have our cell phone because everyone has one anyway and we cant always talk to our friends, they have other classes all the way down the hall way. If we not doing any school thing why not. i understand not having them in classrooms because they disturbed class if the ringer go off.

when your trying to text during class it makes them click clack and all that noisy it makes other students not get there work done... but outside of class what the big dell i don't understand that part of the agreement.",0
"Many people argue whether or not summer projects should be designed by students or by teachers. These summer projects would help the students continue learning while on break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they would challenge the students, teachers have a better understanding of the information, and the projects would prepare students for the school year.

The first reason why summer projects should be teacher-desinged is because they would better challenge the students. Challenging projects cause students to learn the information better. Students must think outside the box in order to actually learn something. A challenging project is one that causes students to have to conduct research, and if the students research for their projects then they would higher chance of remembering the information. If the projects were student-designed then the students would take the easy way out and make the projects easier, which does not help the students grow in any way. Easy projects would cause the students to take less time on it and forget the information faster. Teachers would not only make the projects more challening, but also more reliable.

The second reason why projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers have a better understanding of the information. Students haven't learned the information yet, so the projects that are student-designed would be less reliable than the teacher-designed projects. The teachers know the information because they teach it every year, so the projects would be thorough. If the students designed a project with out completely knowing the information then they could be setting other students up for failure. Teachers have a syllibus to work off of and students do not, so if the students designed the projects they could hurt and not help. The teacher-designed projects would be more helpful for students because teachers better understand the information, and the projects would give students insight on the following year.

The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they would prepare students for the upcoming year. Teachers have the whole year planned out before the start of school, especially returning teachers. Because they have the year planned, they know exactly what information is on the syllibus. The projects the teachers would design would be better than the ones student-designed because they would be planned according to what will be taught during the school year. This would help the students get an idea of what the year would be like and have a better understanding of the information before the start of school.

Many people disagree on whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. The projects, designed by either students or teachers, would continue the education of students through the break regardless of who creates them. Student-designed projects would help students learn because people their own age understand their learning techniques better than teachers; however, summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would better challenge the students, the teachers know the information better, and the projects would give the students an idea of what the school year would be like.",0
"Going to any parks is very fun, enjoyable, and exciting to always try their interesting activities.

People go to parks to have fun and able to enjoy their time with their loved ones. They go to a park to spend their time outdoors.

Community parks, state parks, and national parks provide a wide variety of interesting activities like enjoying the outdoors playing sports, kids can have fun playing, and you can also hangout with your friends.

Firstly, any parks has a lot of interesting activities that everyone can have fun and enjoy themselves, therefore they make sure that they have a lot of choices to do for example, you live near by the neighborhood park and the weather outside is beautiful, so you decide to call your friends and tell them to meet you at the park, so you guys can enjoy the weather while playing sports outdoor.

Secondly, parks is always a good place to bring children to have fun, enjoy themselves, and let them be free. Bringing your kids to the park is always a good choice therefore, they can go to the swings, sea saw, slides, and they can also go run around or you can also bring them to a amusement park where they can go on many rides. For example, Generic_Name is bringing her daughter and son to a water park, where the kids could enjoy themselves by going on a water slides or go swimming around the pool.

Lastly, park is the best place to go and hangout with your friends, where you can all talk freely, have fun, goof around, and mess around with. For example, Its summer so you and your group of friends decide to go to a amusement park so you guys can bond, enjoy yourselves, walk around, ride a lot roller coaster, and have fun before summer ends.

There are many different type of parks in the world, but all of them has one in common and that is to make sure its enjoyable and fun for everyone to enjoy with their friends and family.",0
"Every day, people make decisions that will affect their life, and they usually consult others before this decision is made. People need more than just one opinion on a topic to provide clarity, and to help them be more mindful about their choice. If most people are telling you to do one thing, they are most likely correct.

So how can getting more than just one opinion provide you with more clarity? Asking people who you trust will have your best interest in mind, and will take that into account when telling you their opinion. They will also have reason(s) as to why they chose what they chose. If you ask several people on their view of the subject, and they all say something completely different as to what you're thinking, and they all agree on one thing, you are most likely incorrect. But, if they all agree with you, you could probably make your choice.

If you are someone who isn't usually very careful when it comes to decision making, asking others will help you. Before you jump into whatever choice you make, ask a friend or someone impartial about the topic. If they don't say what you thought was best, it'll make you stop and think, and maybe even consult others. If your friend or impartial person agrees with you, then you are probably correct. Overall, asking others ensures you won't make your decision too quickly and mess up.

When you get more opinions, it'll slow you down and ensure you'll be more careful. Plus, it'll make the right choice apparent. It is clear you should get multiple opinions to provide you with clarity, and mindfulness.",0
"I agree wholeheartedly with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The ability to step out of one's comfort zone and take on a new challenge is essential to becoming a better, more rounded version of oneself. I personally have experienced this firsthand.

For example, while in college, I decided to branch out and try a language class I had never studied before: Japanese. I had never taken any Japanese courses before, nor did I have any prior knowledge of the language. It was a huge undertaking to learn an entirely new language, and I experienced numerous setbacks along the way. However, through hard work and dedication, I was eventually able to get a handle on it. But perhaps more importantly, through conquering this challenge I gained a much greater appreciation for myself and my abilities—and had come a long way in terms of personal growth.

Similarly, in my professional career I chose to take on a project that I had never attempted before. I had to learn a new programming language and adapt to other unfamiliar tools. Again, I encountered many roadblocks during this process, but the experience allowed me to gain a much greater understanding of programming and develop my coding skills to a point where I can now take on even more complex tasks.

Trying something new is never easy, and there is certainly no guarantee of success. But by taking the plunge and pushing my own boundaries, I have been able to experience great growth and come to a better understanding of my capabilities. Therefore, I fully agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson’s statement, and believe that pushing oneself to try something beyond what one has already mastered is the only way to truly grow.",1
"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are thinking about requiring every student to need to take part in community service. While i do think that everyone should take part in it, i don't think it should be required.

First, I would like to point out that yes, community service does teach children that there are things that need to be done in our community and it does also teach good character. But, not every child has parents that are able to take them to do their community service because most parents work. For example, my parents own their own business and yes they can just close it when ever they need to but, you also have to realize that if they are out taking me to do my community service their store is not open and when it isn't open they do not make money. If students can not make it to their community service and it is required, i don't think that is fair to make then suffer a punishment or have a lowered grade just because they had no way of getting there.

Secondly, I do think that there are some children out there that want to do something to make a difference in their community but not all children want to. Wouldn't you much rather make some sort of sign up sheet for the children that actually want to participate? Some kids would take doing community service as a punishment and maybe they might act disrespectful during their time serving.

Lastly, not all students have the time after school to do community service. I know for example, that i am willing to do community service but i have volleyball six days a week after school. I know i do have one day a week off but i would rather take that one day off.

Thank you for listening to my ideas, i hope that i have made an impact of your decision.

sincerely, student",0
"Phones and Driving

In this day and age you could not go anywhere without seeing a cell phone. It is obvious that they are a very important part of our society today. However a big problem and debate that everyone has is whether or not they should be aloud for use while driving. They can take your focus off of the task at hand which could be dangerous. However I believe that they should be allowed for use while driving.

In the car, a cell phone can be very useful. One big thing it is used for is maps. You can use your cell phone to look up your destination. Without the use of your maps you could get lost around town. Or stuck somewhere that you do not want to be. This could see to be dangerous so your cell phone could help you.

Another reason I personally believe they should be used is for music. I do not believe I could find many people to agree with me on this one if I am being honest. However, the music is very important to some people and it can help concentration while driving. It can keep you awake if you are tired. I think it is safe, as long as you just shuffle a playlist and do not stay looking at your phone to change songs.

Cell phones all around can be very helpful when it comes to driving. They can help your focus with music so you're not falling asleep behind the wheel. They can also help you not get lost in the middle of nowhere. So as long as you are safe and aware I think cell phones can be beneficial to driving.       ",0
"Imagine being able to learn and attend school from the comfort of your own home. With the advent of distance learning, that just might become a reality. Distance learning would allow students to attend classes and participate in learning from home by way of online interaction or video conferencing. Allowing students to learn from home could have significant benefits, completely changing the traditional school system and altering the way we view school; however, it could also have some drawbacks, such as preventing teachers from monitoring students. Despite its potential drawbacks, distance learning would significantly benefit students, as it would resolve issues with the school transportation system and make it easier to attend school, cut down on the amount of time wasted in a traditional school environment, and prevent the spread of disease among school populations.

Today, transportation to and from school is slow, inconvenient, and wastes a large amount of time, requiring students to wake up earlier, walk to take a bus, and ride a slow, unsafe school bus to their school. In some cases, children cannot even get reliable transportation from buses and often get to school late due to issues with buses. At other times, students may not even be able to take a bus, and must get to school some other way, often taking time out of their parents' day as well as theirs. With distance learning, the issues of school transportation would be no more, as children would not have to worry about catching the bus or getting to school and could learn from home. This would allow students to get more sleep and to more reliably get to school, as they would no longer have to wake up early to catch the bus and would no longer have to worry about transportation issues making them late for school; they would simply have to wake up and walk to a computer in their house to access their school. Distance learning would undoubtedly mitigate the issues so often seen in the public school transportation system.

In today's school environment, a significant amount of time is wasted, with students taking time to walk from class to class, teachers showing up late, and large amounts of time wasted in class doing nothing. With distance learning, the school day could be compressed and shortened by removing things that waste time, such as traveling between classes and unused class time. Students doing schoolwork at home would be able to simply switch from one class to another after they have finished, and doing work online would shorten the amount of time it takes for teachers to teach and give work. Distance learning would also prevent students from being late to class, as the change between classes would become instantaneous if done online. If schools began using distance learning, it is very likely that the school day could be significantly shortened, giving students more time to do other things.

Recent events have shown how poorly the school system has performed in preventing the spread of disease among student populations. With the recent coronavirus outbreak, many school systems have shut down and moved to online learning to prevent the transmission of the disease between students. Currently, schools are a hotbed for the spread of disease, as sick students can infect many of their classmates due to the close proximity of students in schools. When sick students stay home, they prevent the spread of disease, but they are also forced to miss school and must make up work when they get back, leading to large workloads and lots of work. With distance learning, however, the spread of disease between students would be completely prevented, as there would no longer be any close contact between people. Many schools that have moved their classes online due to the COVID-19 outbreak have been very successful in both preventing the spread of disease and in continuing the education of students away from the physical school environment. Distance learning would completely prevent the spread of disease among students and faculty, and moving school over to distance learning now could make it easier to continue schooling if another disease outbreak occurs in the future.

Distance learning is a new form of education that could revolutionize the school system and change the way we perceive education. Allowing students to learn and do work at home would make education much easier for many in the country, and would remove many of the issues prevalent in the modern school system. While it may come with some drawbacks, distance learning will provide massive benefits to students in the long run, such as removing issues with transportation, decreasing the amount of time wasted, and preventing the spread of disease. The American public school system has long been criticized for being inefficient and out-of-date; distance learning may be just the thing to change that.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a strict policy about cell phone usage. Some other schools don't stick to that rule as well as we do and you may think that is a problem, but not me. Personally I feel that we (the students) should be allowed to carry our cell phones around and to school if we use them wisely. We should be allowed to use them during passing breaks and at lunch because that will and does not affect our learning.

I see why this rule was so strictly enforced as well because some students could abuse this and bring their phones into class. Just having it in class wouldn't be that bad either but some students may try and use them. Which is why i think the rule of having phones be turned off while in class is the perfect solution. But if the students ever try to abuse that ability of having it with them, then the teachers just need to put their foot down and maybe even give punishments to the students who don't choose to follow their rules.

Some kids only got their cell phones so that their parents could contact them when needed. If students weren't allowed to have their phones then the parents may not be able to reach them when needed. We could check our phones during passing breaks to see if anyone had called or messaged us. Our parents would be happy with this because then we could tell them what they needed or just answer back.

Mostly all the kids here are very mature and I feel would be able to use this privilege in the best way possible. I have never been giving the chance to try, but I know we wouldn't let you down. If you would please consider what I said and let the students of your school, SCHOOL_NAME, have a chance to prove to you how good this can be.

"Luke thinks other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. He graduated in Highschool, had two jobs and didnt know his life would change. Don his friend invited him to go to Europe and he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In the passage it says it was 1945, World War II was over in Europe and many countrys were left in ruins. Europe was in trouble because they needed to recover their food supplies, animals, and more. So if anything like this happened you could help them out.

The passage also says In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. Not only you would work in Europe you would be around the world and that could be a unique adventure which you could do if u joined Seagoing Cowboys.

Lastly the passage says Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Just for signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys program it could take you to higher places.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would be really intresting. You might just go to a place you always wanted to go but your not just going there because you want to go your going their for a good cause.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear, as demonstrated by examples from around the world. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has implemented a car-free policy, with only two places available for car parking. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars when they moved there. The residents of Vauban have found that giving up their cars has led to a decrease in stress and an overall increase in happiness. This trend is not limited to Germany; it is growing in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.

Limiting car usage is an essential step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By separating suburban life from the use of cars, communities like Vauban are able to drastically reduce emissions from tailpipes. This approach is known as ""smart planning"" and involves making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, as well as reducing the space available for parking. By placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of in malls along highways, communities can encourage residents to rely less on cars for their everyday needs.

Efforts to limit car usage are gaining traction in the United States as well. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are beginning to take action. It is expected that public transportation serving suburbs will play a much larger role in federal transportation bills in the coming years. In the past, the majority of funding has gone towards highways, but that is likely to change as the importance of reducing car usage becomes more widely recognized.

Other cities around the world are also implementing car-free initiatives. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog, and the ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia has been hosting a car-free day for the past few years, which has gained popularity and drawn the attention of municipal authorities from other countries. These cities are discovering that limiting car usage not only improves air quality but also promotes alternative transportation options, reduces stress, and creates a more connected and vibrant community.

The decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States may indicate a fundamental shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend could have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the country. While the decrease in driving can partly be attributed to the recession, researchers believe that there is something more fundamental going on. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the availability of car-pooling apps are all contributing to a cultural shift away from car dependence.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and impactful. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality and reducing stress, communities around the world are finding that embracing alternative transportation options and creating car-free spaces can lead to significant benefits. By reimagining suburbs and promoting the use of public transportation, walking, and biking, we can create more sustainable and vibrant communities for future generations.",1
"I am againt the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars need a whole lot of sensors. Radar was a device on a hiltop that cost two hundred million dollars. We should be investing that money on things that are important. For example help people in need, feed the hungry ect. Why woukld anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't the drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? we are becoming lazier by the time. Imagaine how much money the driverless cars will cost in the future. Most of of wouldn't even have the money to afford them. We will still buy them, why? Because everyone will have them and it will be the trend, we get carried away for what others get or do and we want to do the same. If technology failed and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture? We shouldn't trust in techonolgy, failure could happen. hese werer some reasons why I am againt the development of driverless cars.   ",0
"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile.

Determine means you have reached a decision. Firstly, once you have determined yourself, you will know what to do forward. For example, you are having trouble with your weight so you are planning to be fitness. You spend two hours a day going to the gym or go jogging every early morning. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. Secondly, determination can be a supporter for you to reach your goal. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades. You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home. If you do that everyday, you will get good grades and graduate.

Determine can also make your time more worthwhile. Imagine after all the time you have to spend on doing something are now accomplished, you will feel very pleasant and proud of yourself. The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Otherwise, it can make you have more patience in life. You will not stop chasing on what you want to do although you have to face many problems in life. Therefore, you both get good accomplishment also a better personality.

In the other hand, being idle in determining makes you are a useless person. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you need to buy a house but you have no money. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Beside that, idleness will make you have no respect from people. Although people are working and getting success, you just sit there and get failure.

It is not hard to determine what to do. Making lists is a way. It helps you analyze a lot of things to work on, makes you have more accomplishment, and you will become a successful person in life.",0
"Schools should not be year-round for many reasons, the foremost of which has to do with the importance of summertime for students. Summertime is a time for students to de-stress and take a break from the rigor of regular school life. It gives them the opportunity to learn and explore outside of the classroom in ways traditional schooling cannot. 

Moreover, research shows that longer hours of schooling actually decrease education quality. When students are in school for too long, the quality and quantity of learning decreases. By taking regular summer breaks, students are able to come into the new school year fresher and more motivated. Summer breaks also allow students to spend more time with their family and friends, which can be especially beneficial for teenage development.

Finally, longer school years are expensive and can put incredible strain on school systems. Year-round schools require additional funds for staffing, utilities, and resources. It can often be too costly for schools with already strained budgets. In contrast, summertime can be a much-needed break for the school system and for administrators. 

In summary, summertime is a vital part of the school year for students, and schools should not be year-round. Summer offers students a chance to rest and explore, the quality of their learning is improved, and it can be more cost-effective for school systems.",1

"Venus the second planet from the sun and very dangerous. A thick cloud of carbon dioxide and heats to high for the humen body, but desipite all of the dangers the autor of this passage still wants to go. Despite all of the dangers is this really worth to pursuit.

The aurtor gives us a idea in paragraph 3 of how dangerous Venus is. A 97% thick cloud of carbon dixoide. Heats high enough to kill a humen, up to eight hundred degress! Thunder storms with frequent lightnign strikes that would kill a humen if stuck by one. Lastly its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earths that would crush a submarine, machines built to withstand pressure! Many more dangers await us on Venus but the possiblity behind all of these dangers is amazing.

The reason the autor wants to go to Venus is just because of human curisotiy and insight of the planet itself theres no real claim for anything else. (NASA) is the only scientific reason stated but even then all the text the autor shows is making a craft to just hover over Venus nothing about actuly exploring the plant. The autor's aproche to this subject could have been more enhancing if they would have given scientfic reasons then just for human curisity.

Venus the sister to earth if she had deadly wepons and was ready to strike you if you got close. The autor makes good points on why we should go there but if you were to ask me I would build and wast recorses on this if this was the convincing paper.                   ",0
"Dear Principal,

I think it's wrong to take away the advantage of students to participate in any kind of school sports/ activities.

Why cant you change the school policy so that kids can participate with at least a C average?

Some students can have all A' s in their classes and not be athletic.

They can be ""obese "" but with good grades.

Other kids might have a grade C average and be really athletic and if u take away their privilege they will not have time to take away the ""stress"" from school, to just forget about school and have fun.

Of course if you put up the standard they have to have in order to participate maybe they will try harder than what they usually try and get a B or even an A.

But that will just stress them even more. With a grade of B average only a certain amount of students will be eligible to participate.

But with a grade C average more kids will be able to go to different activities that the school does.

If the school has activities or sports shouldn't all kids be able to enjoy them?",0
"Over thousands of people have died from car accidents due to texting and driving. They pay attention to their phone more than the road. Texting and driving is bad because it causes a lot of accidents, it can cause a lot of deaths, and could harm a lot of people.

Texting and driving cause a lot of car accidents. While you're replying to someone on the phone you aren't looking at the road. You can cause damage to people and even kill people from not paying attention to the road. According to google over 1.6 million car crashes happen all over the world and is putting a dent in the human population. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

Each day, 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving. 2.35 million people in the US are injured or disabled by car crashes every year. More than 330,000 of these crashes that cause severe injury are caused by texting and driving. This means that over 78% of all distracted drivers are distracted because they have been texting while driving.

Texting and driving can also harm the people around you. In the accident you could kill someone around you because you're not paying attention to the road. Just from texting and driving over 2 million people are in an accident and 500 thousand people are injured and over 15 thousand people died from car crashes due to texting and driving.

Texting and driving is a very dangerous topic. A lot of people are hurt and also died from texting and driving related accidents.

"in the article ""driverless cars are coming"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars and that means im against the development of these cars because there are so many negative aspects and not a lot of positive aspects which mean that the driverless car is not that safe. some of the positive aspects of driverless cars are: 1. googles cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. 2. within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. 3. the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowinging far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. some of the negative aspects of driverless cars are: 1. these smart-roads systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to exisiting roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical. 2. the sensors werent there, the computers werent there, and the mapping wasnt there. radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. 3. presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. as a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. this is why im against the development of driverless cars because they arent that safe unless they have a human driver in the driverless cars at all times. the driverless cars would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus but the cars would still need a human driver to have control at all times. the driverless cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents, but so far, google cars arent truly driverless. without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? for starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors. googles modified toyota prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, and an inertial montion sensor. the most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. the combination of all this input is necessart for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own. it costs a lot of money to make driverless cars actually driverless.. they have to spend two hundred million dollars on a radar that is on top of a hill. the car can handle driving funstions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. in fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselver, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready yo take over when the situation requires.",0
"Do you like online classes or going to school? I think going to school is the better option because if you take online classes you cant ask questions,dont get the full experience of class,and you also dont meet new friends and people. Going to school and being present has very many advantages.

When you are in school you are able to be with the teacher. It is easier to ask questions so they can demonstrate or answer and explain it to you. I feel it is easier to understand if you are shown and told verbally instead of through email or text. It is much harder to ask questions if you are doing it through a computer. It is easier for the teachers to be able to help you in person and not try to explain it through a screen.

Being in school has a much better advantages than online does. If you are online you do not get the full experiences as you do with going to school. You cant join clubs,go to fun pep rallies, or even go on field trips. Going to school may seem boring and useless but it gives you experience, especially with adult figures. Online classes dont offer sports so if you wanted to join a sport you cant through a computer, unless you are playing online. Once you get out of school you will miss it. It is a great time to explore who you are and who you want to be.

Finally if you dont go to school you will not make new friends. It is hard to make new friends and meet new people through a computer. It is so much fun making friends in a school full of one thousand people. It is great to be in school and have friends in your classes. School is like a pool full of new and mysterious people. It is good to have teachers by your side for help. Friends are a really good support system. If you are home and something happens it is good to go to school and talk to your friends about it instead of staying home and keeping it in. Friends help with a lot that you need.

I get that home school is fun but it isnt always the best choice. Online classes may sound so cool, you can just stay in your pajamas all day long and do your work but is staying home all the time really that fun. Dont you just want to get out there and have somewhere to be. Online classes may still be a good option for some people but for most being at school is a great thing. School is just a better option in all. Home school isnt so fun when something happens at home and you have nobody to talk to or nowhere to go.

Going to school is still the best option because you cant make friends,you dont get the full experience, and you cant ask teachers questions one on one. Going to school is a really good opportunity for everyone to find out who you are. School is a fun and enjoying place, it has so many opportunities you would never get doing online classes.",0
"Limiting car usage has many advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options, such as public transportation and cycling. Finally, reducing car dependence can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. These advantages make it clear that limiting car usage is a positive step towards a more sustainable and livable future.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. The passage set states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make progress towards achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have detrimental effects on human health. The passage set mentions that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for ourselves and future generations.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options. The passage set describes an experimental community in Germany called Vauban, where car ownership is limited and public transportation and cycling are prioritized. Similarly, the passage set mentions a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, which aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By investing in public transportation infrastructure and prioritizing walking, cycling, and public transit, we can create more accessible and sustainable cities that are less dependent on cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. The passage set mentions that some residents of Vauban, Germany, feel happier and less stressed without cars. By reducing car usage, people are encouraged to walk or cycle more, leading to increased physical activity and improved health. Additionally, by investing in walkable neighborhoods and improving pedestrian infrastructure, we can create environments that are conducive to active lifestyles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, promote sustainable transportation options, and encourage healthier and more active lifestyles. By prioritizing alternatives to cars and investing in sustainable transportation infrastructure, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly cities. The benefits of limiting car usage make it clear that it is a necessary step towards a more sustainable and prosperous future.",1
"Dear Principal,

Students should not be forced to do community service, because if they strongly dislike community service work they might resent it when they are older and prevent their children that might like community service to do some work for the community. On the other hand, a child might like the work they are required to do, so I suggest that you gradually encourage students to help the community, but not involuntarily force your students to do community service work.

I have known from some friends that they loathe having to be forced to work for the community. It does not help the school or the place they are volunteering either that the dislike the work, and will do a terrible job or even make the condition of the place worst by misplacing the position of objects or supplies. The group of friends fee that it takes would take up their whole day as they could have done something enjoyable for themselves like going to the mall or trying to finish a project (s)he has procrastinated on and is due very soon.

However, I have had a class discussion on this topic, and most of the answers said were that, service should not be forced on to a person, but rather have a slow buildup to have the student enjoy their work to help improve their community. I, myself have enjoyed helping my school clearing out fallen leaves, or other trash around my school. It gave a feeling of a sense of accomplishment to me.

I have read a book that is more of a extreme conditions for involuntarily servitude, called The House of the Scorpion, it focuses on a boy that is a clone of El Paso, the drug lord. The boy at first is treated like dirt, but as he is found out about that he is the clone of the powerful El Paso the people are forced to serve the boy first treated like dirt. As the book progresses the boy has to leave his home, and runs away to a salt mine, where he is forced to work eatting only plankton. This leaves him to resent the place and ultimately he escapes and goes to the local nunnery where he is reports this place to the Head Nun. The salt mine is quickly shut down and the boy raids the home of the drug lord only to find out that El Paso died so the boy frees all the slaves and shuts it down forever.

I agree with both sides. Requiring community service can positively and negatively affect a student, depending on their grounds of helping others.

The principal should compromise, instead so that the students will not forever hate helping others, but they will have something that will encourage their own kids to do it. Such as, for everyone that completes the minimal amount of hours they have to do the student will be rewarded some sort of prize, like a homework pass or something like a day just for the students so they can have a entertaining day.",0
"Education is limitless with a variety of ways you can be taught, learning is endless, but distance learning can impact students in a negative way. Throughout some time schools have not changed in the sense that they still teach in classrooms, a more interactive and ""up close and personal"" idea of teaching.

Students complain about not having a takeaway from the environment they are put into. It could be the dynamics of the classroom that they cannot seem to pick up on or even the fact they do not like school itself.

Proposing the idea that a student can stay home and ""learn"" takes away the opportunity to make connections with others and develop any social skills and students are told often that having social skills is a key component to have and understand when you are in the real world. So why give the opportunity to have it taken away.

Yes, students should feel as comfortable as possible when in a learning environment, but should not feel as they need to isolate themselves in order to feel that way. Staying home is not as structured as being at school, parents probably will not be home or have the time to make sure you are getting your work done. School is structured in a way where students have a schedule they (occasionally) abide by everyday,

Having a structured environment is like supporting a students brain, it will help them learn and can help them succeed. Every student is different and their learning styles vary, this could work for some but could effect the way they learn for say, when they go to college.

Distance learning is not interactive and and not ""up close and personal"". Students have the decision on whether or not they want to do the video chat or confrence, it can be also be seen as a ""get away"" from reality after all it is behind a screen, taking into account that learning is endless, but not being in a classroom interacting with others will not benefit a student in a way they thing it will.",0
"""Face"" the Facts

The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the ""truth"" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing more than a natural landform.

First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it says ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.

Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.

Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.

To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to

In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.

"Meat, a staple in many people's diets, has been a topic of controversy in recent years. As the effects of meat consumption on the environment and human health have come to light, a movement to reduce meat intake has gained traction. While some argue that cutting back on meat is necessary for a sustainable future, others claim that it's a personal choice and shouldn't be dictated. In this essay, I will argue for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, providing reasons and examples to justify this position.

First and foremost, the environmental impact of meat consumption cannot be ignored. The production of meat, particularly beef, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, livestock accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector. Additionally, the demand for meat has led to widespread deforestation, with forests being cleared to make way for grazing land and feed crops. By adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Furthermore, the health benefits of a plant-based diet are undeniable. Numerous studies have shown that vegetarians and vegans tend to have lower rates of obesity, heart disease, and other chronic conditions compared to meat-eaters. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains provides essential nutrients and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found that vegetarians had a 12% lower risk of death from all causes compared to non-vegetarians.

Another argument in favor of a vegetarian or vegan diet is the ethical treatment of animals. Factory farming, which is the dominant method of meat production, involves keeping animals in inhumane conditions, often cramped and unsanitary. Animals are frequently subjected to practices such as beak trimming, tail docking, and castration, all of which are painful and stressful. By choosing plant-based options, we can help reduce the demand for factory-farmed meat and promote more humane treatment of animals.

On the other hand, some argue that cutting back on meat consumption is a personal choice and shouldn't be dictated. They claim that meat is an important source of protein and essential nutrients, and that a vegetarian or vegan diet may be lacking in these nutrients. However, this argument is flawed. There are numerous plant-based sources of protein, such as beans, lentils, tofu, and tempeh, which are not only nutritious but also more environmentally friendly than meat. Additionally, many vegetarian and vegan alternatives to meat are now available, making it easier than ever to adopt a plant-based diet.

In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a crucial step towards a sustainable future. The environmental and health benefits of a plant-based diet are undeniable, and the ethical treatment of animals is a moral imperative. While some may argue that cutting back on meat consumption is a personal choice, the impact of meat production on the environment and human health cannot be ignored. By choosing plant-based options, we can make a positive impact on the planet and promote a healthier lifestyle. Therefore, I strongly argue in favor of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.",1
"Dear Principal,

I have heard your idea so only kids with a grade B average. I do not agree with you, I think if you make it a policy there will be no sports teams. Kids could get mad at the school and drop out or change schools. It could affect there learning. They can be really good at a sport but can't play because of this policy. It can affect there life in the future by making them not want to play a sport when there good at that sport and they had a bright future in front of them. You might it will help but I don't think that will help because it matters how much dedication you put it to something, not if your forced to do well to play a sport. Another reason is that sports are healthy and if there not allowed to play sports they go out of weight. Be less healthy and then we would have a serious problem. As you can see I don't want this policy because it can affect kids life. My call to action would be that this policy not be put in action.",0

Well the next day i went that same school and they told me that i couldn't be there at all! and they also said that if they see me there at that same school they would call the police on me again. That's why you shouldn't drive fast or pass red lights because they would double the money. Now i noe not to go to that school again.

"To the Principal,

I think that community service should be performed out of school in your own time because the school should be teaching academics and not giving back to the community. Community service should be an individuals choice, not a forced unpaid job because the people that do community service usually want to and would do a better job than the people who don't care or want to do it.

In school, I believe that the students should perform a few hours or the minimum requirement just to give them the idea of community service. Academics are far more important in my eyes than almost anything else in school. And taking that time away would lessen the time they get to learn about academics. If anything, the parents of the student should introduce community service to the student and even they shouldn't force them do it either.

Don't get me wrong, I think community service is a necessity. Recreation coaches, people who clean up litter, and referees are all unpaid people who give up their free time to help their community. but they are not forced to give up their time. People who don't want to do community service shouldn't have to.

Well it is your choice to make community service necessary in school, and I hope I persuaded you otherwise.",0
"As an 8th grader, I know that choosing the right courses to take in high school is crucial in setting me up for success in my future career and business. I want to be a successful entrepreneur and own my own business, but I know that it won't be easy. That's why I'm doing my research now to make sure I'm taking the right classes to get me there.

First, I'm going to focus on taking courses that will help me develop my business skills. I want to take classes in marketing, finance, and management to learn how to run a successful business. I'm also going to take classes in computer science and programming to learn how to build and maintain a website and manage my business's digital presence.

In addition to business classes, I'm also going to take courses that will help me develop my writing and communication skills. I know that as a business owner, I'll need to be able to communicate effectively with my customers and employees, so I want to make sure I'm well-versed in writing and public speaking.

Another important aspect of my research is looking into the benefits of committing to a career early in high school. I know that by focusing on my career goals now, I'll be able to gain valuable experience and build a strong foundation for my future. By taking challenging courses and getting involved in extracurricular activities, I'll be able to demonstrate my commitment to my career and show colleges and potential employers that I'm serious about what I want to do.

I'm also considering taking online courses to gain more experience. I know that online courses can be a great way to learn new skills and expand my knowledge without having to take time away from my regular classes. Plus, they can be more flexible and convenient, which can be helpful for someone like me who has a lot of responsibilities and commitments.

Finally, I'm researching how to get scholarships to help pay for college. I know that college can be expensive, and I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to make it more affordable. By applying for scholarships and grants, I'll be able to reduce the amount of money I need to take out in loans, which will make my college experience less stressful and",1
"Many people around the world believe in the benefits of distance learning. In fact, various schools throughout the country have began to offer distance learning as an option for their students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Attending classes from home is detrimental to a student's education because of it encourages distractions, limits interactive activities, and prevents social development.

One reason distance learning is detrimental to a student's education is its encouragement of distractions. Often times a student's home is the place where they are most comfortable, but it can also be where they find the most distractions rather it's a sibling, pet, or electronic device. Students struggle to focus and obtain information when they are surrounded by a pool of distractions. Learning in a classroom provides students with a quiet, distraction-free space to learn while also providing them with the tools that they need to be successful. It is also a place where students can learn information through interactive activities.

In addition to a distracting environment, distance learning provides no hands-on activities for students which can be very detrimental to their education. Many students tend to be visual learners and benefit from interactive activities. Past studies have shown that participating in hands-on and interactive activities increases the amount of information that students are able to absorb. When working from home, students are simply working straight from a computer screen without any visual explanation for the information they are learning. This prevents students from getting the hands-on experience that is so beneficial to their educational success. A classroom with an educator allows a student to participate in hands-on activities, receive explanations, and collaborate with others.

Additionally, prevention of social development is another major reason of why distance learning should not be offered to students. When working from home, students often isolate themselves, only communicating with their educator and family. Distance learning prevents the character and social development that would normally be received in a school environment. Coming to school allows people to communicate with peers and teachers while developing a wide variety of social skills. When working with others, students are able to develop communication and leadership skills while learning how to work hard and how to be patient with their fellow peers.

Others might argue that distance learning provides students with a comfortable environment for learning. In reality, one's home is too comfortable of a place to successfully learn. Distance learning can be very detrimental to a student's education because it creates a distracting environment, disallows hands-on learning, and prevents the development of important life skills. In all, this feature of online learning should not be allowed for students because of its detriments to educational success. ",0
"i agree that all students must particiapte in atleast one extra activity,to help kids, and help students be more creative, if kids do sports they would have more energy. and would need to stregnthing their bones. if kids do stuff like sports, activities it will be more fun. working on the year books seems fun because you can see the students in your classroom faces, and also i think student council would be cool too its almost like being a real counciler. and i think if parents let their children do sports i think its a good thing because the students are learning how to do sports and etc. i think extraccuricular activites like art, paint, drew, sketch and dances and more little parties. i think they should do these activites for all ages. the more students that Join the more funnier and creative it will be. students can learn aot of new things by doing sports, and joining in fun and creative activites. sports is a very hard thing to do because you have to keep practicing n practicing til you get better at it. alot of kids do sports after or either during school hours while in gym class. activities are fun for little or big Students. i think for when students do activites the parents or guardians should Join as well with their children. ",0
"The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversable but the sun has not yet set, there's hope and it comes in the shape of a shifting world wide attitude towards vehicles. Governments are focusing on making green zones designed to limit car use. There are a plethura of positive effects that this may have on society. Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to savour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one wont be alone in their endeveors.

To begin, cars emit green house gasses which will acumulate in our atmosphere trapping heat underneath it as it tries to leave our planet. This leads to a cumilative effect that causes the earth's average temperature to rise. In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Elizabeth Rosenthal says ""Green house gas emitions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas emitions in the country."" America barely has any regulations in relation to greenhouse gas emitions to start with but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few regulations  and some smart city planning. The benifits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.

Another good reason to switch is riding a bike or travelling on a train or bus is much more relaxing than rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging. instead you can lesiurely wait to arrive at your destination. In German Suburb Elisabeth Rosenthal writes a quote from an interview which says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier now."" This media trainer said this as she walked the streets of Verdant ""where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown{ed} out the occasional distant motor."" This is beautiful, borderline serene, only a crazy person would dissagre with such an environment.

Now traveling all the way across the world, from Germany to Columbia. These countries are both spearheading the experiments with pollution reduction and in Bogata -The capital of Columbia, they actually organize ""Car free days"" seven million people in Bogota alone participated in the event, violaters would even have to pay a $25 fine. According to Andrew Selsky, the author of Car Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogoto, ""[Even] the rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" It seems that, rightfully, this event is treated as a celebration and it has great effects on the environment.

In conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackling environmental issues. If people stay on track it will be easy, fun, relaxing and the Earth will be admired for many years to come.                                                             ",0
"Nowadays people show their emotions simply just by looking at their face. Today's technology is advancing quickly that they even found a way to tell people's emotions. How can they accurant about they're emotions though? I personally think that only a person can feel what they're going through. I don't think technology is so accurate to look into someone's soul.

Prof. Thomas Huang and his crew discovered a new software that can recognize emotions. However I believe that no one can tell other people how they but them theirselves. How can they actually calculate emotions, only us humans express what we feel, not technology. This software begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This software is not very accurate.

We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking at their face because you know the person that well. Although most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang studies artist such as da Vinci to help him paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electrical code.

The famous painting Mona Lisa is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. It's like saying that your own PC can tell your emotions, it's pretty impossible. To an expert, faces don't lie. Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. For example, actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowining as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Someone's emtions is way more different than the science of emotions.",0

Driverless cars would be a good thing. It would be a big step in technology. Take some risks out of being on the road. It would also save some money. A car that drives itself would be a great achievement.

To begin, if the car drove itself then it wouldnt be as dangerous. When people are drunk they wouldnt wreck because of them being careless. The car can take over and have heads up display. Somthing not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. This makes that a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.

Secondly, The car can save gas money. With the car driving the proper speeds and everything the car wouldnt waste gas. Sergey Brin foresees that the cars would use half of the fuel in todays taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus would. The cars would be a good change for the world and the environment.

Finally, The cars would be a big jump in technology. It would be a big advancement. Radars used to be a big deal now anyone can get them. There are already some cars that can already drive themselves a little but there not ready for the streets. Tesla thinks in 2016 they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. Every day we get closer to having an automated car.

I think the automated cars would be good. The roads would be safer. Cost less money than spending gas all the time. It would be easier to drive the car. The car could be easier to learn.

Overall the driverless car is a great idea.    ",0
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Some people are great at giving advice while others are not. When I ask for advice, I go to my 3 closest friends. I think it is a good idea to talk to multiple people when asking for advice. Seeking multiple people for opinions or advice can help, for it will reduce stress, have more choices to choose from, and receive wise words.

To begin with, when someone is going through a situation where they do not know what to do, they will start having a lot of stress on them. stress is not a really good feeling, it can make your head hurt or make you over think about things. For example, when I am going through a situation where I am confused or do not know what to do, I start stressing out and worry a lot. So I go to multiple people for advice and it calms me down a bit and everything is almost back to normal. Getting advice from at least 3 or 4 people will reduce the stress and make the situation better.

Also, going to multiple people for advice will give person more choices to choose from. Going to one person is not bad but when the advice they give is a little bit sketchy or have a feeling that it is not the correct way to go then, going with more than one is better. having more choices to choose from is always a good situation. Sometimes it is hard to choose which is better but at least the advice is good. It is like a multiple choice question on a test where you have 4 or more choices to choose from and one is the correct answer out of all of them.

However, going to one more person for advice is not good all the times. He or She will probably try to give bad advice while making it seem like it is good or will go tell others about the situation. I have been in that situation once where a person I asked advice for told people and then everyone knew. There are some people to trust and others to not trust.

On the contrary, seeking for advice from other will also help with getting some wise words or a good talk about the situation. When a person gets some type of wisdom received from someone else, it will make them think on what they did and why they should not do it again. From experience, I stopped doing some things because someone gave me a wise lecture on them. Not all the time will someone get some wise words or lecture but it does help here and there. An adult or parent can help with wise words because they always give good advice most of the time with a wise lecture.

In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people will help out a lot. The more advice a person seeks, the more they learn and know. Advice will always help with making better choices in life. It is not a bad idea to always seek from help or advice from someone, even if the situation is not a a big deal. So, seeking multiple people for opinions or advice can help, for it will reduce stress, have more choices to choose from, and receive wise words.",0
"I think that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Think about all the great things that will come out of joining the Seagoing Cowboys, it is more than just an adventure.

One reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you get to see different places along the way.

During one trip I had the benefit of being able to see Europe and China.

Also being able to see the Acropolis in Greece made it more special.

When you join this program you will see it as a opportunity, for me it was an unbelivable opportunity for a small-town boy like me.

Another reason to join this program is there is also sometimes where you get to have fun on board.

We would mostly have fun on our return trips after we had unloaded the animals. We would play baseball, volleyball and other stuff like fencing, boxing, and reading.

This program is not just taking care of animals you get time to entertain yourself and do somethings you want to do.

The last reason you should join this program is you might not just see it as an adventure but it gives you the opportunity to help others.

This adventure was more than adventure to me it opened my mind to the world around me.

This will make you aware of the people of other countries and their needs, this trip made me.

When you help these people it will make you feel special.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program, It is an amazing experience. Think about you get to see new things, you get time for lot of fun on board, and you the special feeling of helping someone. I hope you will take time to think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.       ",0
"In the article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus,"" Venus is the second closest planet to our sun, it has the same density and size as Earth. Venus is also one of our neighbor planets along with Mars but the planets Mars and Venus orbit around the sun at different speeds than Earth. The atmosphere on Venus is 97% carbon dioxide, the clowds are made of corrosive sulfuic acid, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than Earth's.

The conditions for any thing living on this planet are impossible for any human to visit this planet. The text states ""A thick atmospher of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere... temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than what we exerience on our own planet."" No one would survive long enough to touch the surface of this planet. The text also states ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustumed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

This proves the danger of this planet and how intrested we are to learn more about it.

Some Astronomers think that Venus was just like earth a long time ago. They think that Venus use to be capable of sustainging life just like earth. the text states ""Astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system..."" The text also stetes ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" The Astronomers even found some evidence that there could have been lif on this planet. The text states ""The planet has of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This may be proof that Venus may have had life billions of years in it's past.

This is what makes Venus so intresting and so dangerous. Hopefully we learn more about the planet in the near feauture and have advanced enough technology to visit the planet.",0
"Success does not come without encountering failures along the way. As Winston Churchill so astutely concluded, success is attained from being able to move from failure to failure without diminishing enthusiasm. Mistakes are an inescapable part of the journey towards success - without making mistakes we are unable to learn and grow. Looking at my own journey, I have had to confront my fair share of mistakes, yet I have used them as a learning opportunity to better myself and my understanding of a particular situation. Consequently, I believe it is essential to be aware of the possible outcomes and consequences before taking any action. Thinking about the repercussions of my decisions not only promotes accountability, but it also helps to maintain a positive reputation and the faith of those around me.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else can help you see wonderful things. In today's world, it is easy to get caught up in the pressures of society and to try to fit in with the crowd. However, I believe that by embracing our individuality and being true to ourselves, we can open ourselves up to a world of possibilities and experiences that we may not have otherwise had the opportunity to see.

One example of this is visiting a place to see nature. When we go into a big forest or see big hills, we are able to connect with the natural world in a way that is not possible when we are surrounded by buildings and concrete. We can see the beauty of the trees, the colors of the flowers, and the sounds of the birds. This connection to nature can help us understand the changing life around us, as we see how the seasons change and how the world is constantly evolving.

Another example of the benefits of being true to ourselves is going to see a place to see nature.

I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because I believe that being true to ourselves is the key to living a fulfilling and meaningful life. When we try to fit in with the crowd and conform to the expectations of others, we are not able to fully express ourselves and live our lives to the fullest. By embracing our individuality and being true to ourselves, we are able to see the world in a new light and open ourselves up to experiences and opportunities that we may not have had the chance to have otherwise.

In conclusion, being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else can help you see wonderful things.

"With the advancement of technology, cars are now being altered to fit human wants.

Driverless cars are advancing in recent years.

According to the text, car companies and manufacturers such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are all in plan of the development of these cars to be sold by the year 2020.

These cars may appear as eye-candy at first glance, however they can cause danger to the people in certain conditions in many ways.

Driverless cars seem spectacular, however people are unaware that it is not ""driveless"" as the manufacturers say.

These cars have the ability to complete the basic necessities of driving, such as steering, accelerating, and braking, but there is a problem with this.

The text explains how the new cars are not able to be driven in certain conditions such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

Because of this, the human driver must stay alert throughout the entire drive when the car is in need of an extra hand.

This is a problem beacuse humans could get bored of waiting or get distracted which is problematic if the car is not fast enough to warn the human.

In short, actually having humans agree to the comitment of being ready to take over the task of driving in a driverless car seems to be unrealistic.

With all this being said, someone might ponder on how the car could be slow to warn the human.

Creating a driverless car means a person has to put all their trust into a large piece of technology.

This could cause many problems, for example, the text explains how the cars are equipt with many cameras and sensors.

This is problematic because if the car's technology has a defect in it in some way, the human in the car will most likely get in an accident without doing anything.

According to the text, many places such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have made it illegal to test computer-driven cars there. Finally, in the case of an accident actually occuring, the problem people would face is if the car manufacturer or the human would be the one to blame.

In the end, driverless cars are not safe and could lead to many problems.

Driverless cars are approaching into the world fast.

This new technology should not be trusted due to the speed of its development.

Humans could face many problems with these cars now entering today's society.

To conclude, driverless cars appear to be an extravegant idea however, when acutually thought out, many issues could occur leaving problems in the end.              ",0
"Before the last day of school, teachers should let their students pick their own project to do over the summer. Most likely if the student creates the project on there own it would be more fun an easily for them to handle. With that being said if a teacher was to give students their on project to do during the summer it probably wouldn't get done. Students attend to do better on things that they designed using there thoughts and also creativity.

Creating a project on your own during the summer before going back to school. Would definitely be awesome for them to create and do it on there own. They get to do design the project in any type of way or style that they want to and it would be less stressful for them. Especially if your some one that did a lot of fun things & also went places during the break u should be able have to talk about what u learned over the summer. It be less work when u create a project on your own because in your head u already know what your project is going to be about, and u will already know what u will have to do to complete the project.

A student would most likely stress over doing a project over the summer designed from a teacher. Most students freeze up when they don't understand what the teacher is asking to them to do or how to start off. Then when u do the project most of the time people stress about how to start it off or they start over thinking there self that stresses a lot of students when it comes to projects especially designed from the teacher. Then on top of that teachers expect everything to be done in the right way to earn full points on the project.

I personally think that students should be able to create there own project instead of the teachers. It would defiantly be less work for the teacher. Teachers attends to ask for to much when they give u a project to complete. Working and creating a project on your own help u understand things more it also make u think more in a good way. Things become much better and if u design your own project it can be about something simple and easy that u learned over the summer.                ",0
"Hey there! 

So, you know how they say honesty is the best policy?  Like, it's totally true. Being honest and authentic in life is super important, like, it's the foundation of any good relationship. I mean, think about it. When you're with someone who's always lying or trying to be someone they're not, it's like, super uncomfortable, right? 

Like, I've been there before. I used to be friends with this girl who was always pretending to be someone she wasn't. She would post all these perfect Instagram pics and act like she was having the time of her life, but in real life, she was just as insecure as the rest of us. And it was like, totally toxic. I mean, I didn't realize it at first, but looking back, I was like, totally enabling her behavior. 

But then I learned my lesson. I started setting boundaries and not putting up with her crap anymore. And you know what? It was like, totally liberating.  I mean, I finally had the courage to be myself and not care what other people thought. And you know what? People respected me for it. 

So, yeah. Being honest and authentic is like, super important. And it's not just about relationships. It's about being true to yourself and not letting other people bring you down. Like, if you're feeling sad or upset, it's okay to show it. Don't be afraid to cry or talk about it. 

And yeah, sometimes it's hard to be honest and authentic. Like, it's scary to be vulnerable and open up to people. But trust me, it's worth it in the long run.  You'll attract people who appreciate you for who you are, and you'll avoid all those toxic relationships that suck the life out of you.

"Human curiosity can be a dangerous but also can lead to ground breaking discoveries. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring

Venus"", talks about how the ""Evening Star"" has great value and there is much to learn from studying it, despite the dangers that come along with it. The author supports this idea becuase he gives readers prime examples of everything that could go wrong by sending a spacecraft to Venus to study it. Although the author also gives us alturnitives for learning about this planet and maybe even inhabiting it some day.

Humans have spent many decades descovering new planets. Each robot that is sent to space took time, money, and countless hours of perfecting it to best fit those planets conditions. In paragrapgh 7 the author compares an average phone to a spacecraft being sent to Venus. ""Imagine exposing a phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin"", This is a good example because people now are very familar or some even attached to thier electronics. The author knew that people would understand just what would happen to a rover by making the comparison of the dangers.

Planets in our solar system never fail to fasinated the people who grauduated with a 4.0 GPA. Scientist believe that Venus was an Earth-like planet many years ago. In paragrapgh 4 it states ""Venus was probably covered with large oceans and could've supported many forms of life.""

"Dear Principal,

Community service is a very helpful thing towards the community, if its cleaning up after a high school game or planting a tree it will all have a positive outcome. I think it would be a good idea to have us do community service because there are a lot of things that need help being done and there are so many kids at school. If they all work together they could easily clean up a school step by step. Some children fail to see the opportunity that you are faced with and do not recognize that they could take ten minutes from their day for a good cause. I see why you are struggling with this decision, some kids might act up and also write letters to you about why we should not have to do anything. Others want to help the town, and show that they care. I personally would love to help you out.

I do not do community service a lot and only have once during school one year, but I understand that some things need done from time to time. During school my teacher had us go out to the high school football stadium and clean up after the past nights game. We went through the stands and picked everything up and placed it in plastic bags to dispose of. The trash was everywhere and it seems it was going to take years. Then after that we picked litter up near the school and in brush. I found it amazing how fast we finished the huge task because of the amount of people participating. I believe that if everyone from the school helped, they would finish rather quickly.

"Dear Principal,

I think the better policy of those two offered is the first policy. For one reason, students already text during class, so if you give them the opportunity to do it in between class periods and during free times, there will be no need for them to text during class.

Another reason to let us have cell phones during free times is that if we need to fix our plans, we could call our parents and tell them what we are going to do. An example of this would be that if your after school activities were cancelled, you could call your parents and arrange for a ride.

A third reason that I like this policy is that if I wanted to go to a friends house, I could just get out my phone in between classes and call my parents and ask them if it was alright if I went. I wouldn't have to go to the office in between classes and I would already have the number programmed into my phone.

If you are afraid of students texting during class even with this policy, then you should design and give them a contract to sign. What I mean by this is that you should make and print out one contract per student. It wouldn't have to be a very fancy or official contract, just make it state that if they do text in class, they lose their privileges. It should also say that if they get caught doing it again, then they would start earning themselves detention.

If you choose the first policy, many students would be happy with your choice. I also suggest that you use some of my ideas to help.

Sincerely,

"Have you ever done extracurricular activities after school? Well in my school our principle makes all the students do extracurricular activities including sports,working on the year book ,and serving in the student council. I agree with this new rule because of these two reasons. It makes you more healthy when you join sports, and It helps you socialize more, also you can make new friends.

As I was saying doing extracurricular activities can make you healthy. It makes you healthy by just running around and exercising. It also makes you healthy by you just having fun. If your sad playing sports can make you happy and something to look forward to at the end of the day. and my final reason on why extracurricular activities after school makes you healthy is you have something to do after school; instead of being bored at your house you can run around and play with others. and that brings me to my next point.

my second point of why extracurricular activities after school is good for you is you get to socialize more. This is good because Its good to talk to others. Another thing thats good about socializing is it helps keep you out of trouble. for example when you are talking to your friends then that means you are ignoring the bad stuff theirs going on around you. finally My final reason on why socializing is good for you is that it makes you earn friends. Having fun and socializing with someone is a good thing and with extracurricular activities after school you can easily make friends.

In conclusion extracurricular activities after school is a good thing because you get to stay healthy and meet new and fun people. I really think people should do extracurricular activities after school because you will have fun and it will not hurt to try some things that interest you.",0
"Dear senator,

I think the Electoral College should be brought down and let the popular vote decide who the president of the United States will be.

First of all, I believe the popular vote should be kept and the Electoral College brought down. I think this because what if some people dont agree with the opinion of others. For example, lets say two people are running too be president of the United States. People vote and everything but then its up too the 538 electors. Then the 538 electors choose who they want as their president, 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, as weeks go by, the new President is one of the two people that ran too be President was elected. Some people are happy and some people are mad because they put their vote in and they voted on the other person but that other person won and now they are angry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ",0
"My Principal has decided that every student must do an extracirricular activity in school. Most people disagree with this statement but I think otherwise. I agree with my principal because it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.

There are many students that sit inside, and dont go outside as much as the are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracirricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. there are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.

another good reason to have everyone do an extracirricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. . All the exercise in fooball is physical, working your legs and arms to burn off fat and build muscle. But you can also improve your confidence and determination.

Finally we have extracirricular activities acting as a great outlet for kids who have family problems and/or are bullied. Most kids who have big problems dont like to open up about them because they feel like they'll be judged or made fun of, but if they are on an engaging sports team, or are working on the yearbook they could have someone to speak with that they trust, or just something to get their mind off of their personal problems.

I hope this helped you get another perspective on how extracirricular activities could help our school. it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.",0
"In the summer when schools require students to complete summer projects I think that these projects should be teacher designed, because if the projects we're students designed the projects wouldnt be as much of a learning process then if it we're a teachers designed project.

first of all why I think that summer projects should be designed by teachers is the learning process of the project. Projects are for students to show what they know and learn more about what they have to research and they would have to take more time in finding factual research about their topics. This is good for students in the summer because it keeps them intact with school in some shape of form and it would keep the students occupied rather than them playing video games, or doing some other thing that rots their brain. To add on by teachers giving out projects in the summer will also benefit the students as well. For example my cousin Adam who lives in newyork was enjoying his summer like any other teen would do, well while he was doing what he was interested in doing he also did not something school related all summer such as reading, researching etc this also too a toll on him because since he wasnt doing anything school related over summer he began to lose focus more in school.

Secondly, why I think teacher should be designing projects in the summer is that it gives them something to do while just doing nothing all summer long. Students could be doing things completely different from school during the summer days, by teachers giving out projects could possibly keep students out of trouble during the summer and it also get their next year of school started off to a great start by them doing the projects. Also by teachers hand out projects in the summer shows that they truly care about their students education and would love to see them succeed and expand their knowledge furthermore.

My third reasoning on why I think ti should be the teachers who design the summer projects is that they are not likely to do projects if they had to design it them self. To add on for example if students were allowed to design their own projects they would most certainly become less focus because they would feel like they wouldnt have to do the project as much or take as serious because they're the ones designing it and not the teachers. By the students designing their own summer projects and most likely not doing could really hurt their school life and their start off grade for the start of the new school year.

Although, some may say that students should be able to design their own summer projects because it allows them to show the teachers what they can do by them self, also lets students work at their own past, and wont overwhelm the students because they get to design anything i their choice. This may be true but like I said before students tend to lose interest and focus more quickly if they seem that the task isnt as important to them. So by teachers designing these summer projects would make it seem more important to the students and it would make them want to do it even more and get benefits out of it.              ",0
"I think students can benefit if they are able to attend classes from home, even know the distance but learning as a option for students who wants to finish a carear or have a good job.

Take those classes online or videos conferencing is not the same thing like to be able to go to classes. In class students can ask about any question they have or get the information they are looking for, and the schools teacher can see how they are learnig but, online they don't have much oction like read a book or be able to ask any question they have to anybody.

Attend to classse is great is a oction from student to choose but is the smart oction for for student who know what they want to do in they future. Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time.

School is not a principle to starts getting information about how thing are working, or what options we can choose for be a porofessional after schools. Prevent oction in schools is preposterous because that is not ducing, good octions during school.

Students who rually have the decition to go to schools even know the distace but they are benefit. that is a oction, but when they get there is alot of information and option they can lissend from teachers and other students. When they go to schools they are giving a step more every day, to them life and they are benefit in school for the alot of option they can have in schools.

Schools is a benifif for all yung people to learnd how start life, when you get out from schools and have a good job. for have the opportunite, students need finish school firts. Not matter the distance or the skills they have during that period time. after that they will see how everything is change to be better in they way.

For somo students is hard to make that decition.

But when they have the oction and they can do it is a good thing because they can learning more about and have more opportunities when they graduate from schools thay have good jobs and more oction to choose.

Some students think is preposterous to to make decition in schools, bacause is alot of oction they can choose, and alot thing they want to be but they only have somo octions. For somo of then is hinder to go and pick that oportunities.

Instance when students live far fom schools is hard to get there they need like a car to get there, but parents are allways insist to students to go to schools not matter how hard is all they wants is a good future for they childrens.

School is a personality decition in life, butsmart decition for people who is looking for good oction in life. Ertheless who finish school have more oction the people who don't finish. During school students need have to be inmate because schools is a hard time.

For students in schools is like stairway, because they walk aroung getting information, that is a good oction for teachers, to stall information and try to preparate students to then life. One way to be a perfectionist is graduste from schools.

Fanally when students finish schools they did a good job and they have more option to choose. More of they have good jods or go to college and finish a carear, and they know how follow the the dreams, because when they was in chools there was alot of skills and the crusts those over and over that was like the firts hard thing they start with, that was alot of bad action they can choose but they don't choose any of those. Finally finish with right thing, Now is fancy work and alot oction to choose in life.                                                                                                          ",0
"Warm and soothing waves of light, the eloquent smell of nature and the outdoors, summer is indeed here. For some, summer is a much needed break from the institutional grind of schooling in America, however for others it irritates their stress. Often, students worry about the projects assigned over the summer, because they're usually tedious and require an exorbitant amount of time to complete. Although it is noted that they're a source of stress to many students, schools maintain that these projects are needed to continuously engage the students in the learning process. This predicament can be resolved by allowing students to design their own projects, which adequately shows their learning throughout the summer. Summer projects should be student-designed, in order to engage students in learning, allow them to be cooperative amongst each other, and prevent the monotonous nature of education in America.

Student-designed summer projects allows the students to better engage in the learning process. Students in America struggle throughout their life attending school while accepting the burden of friendships, family and other stresses and anxieties. Summer becomes that safe haven for them, to completely decompress from their issues and take a break from the mental strain of schools, with all the tests, exams and projects that're encompassed within it. Students who are allowed the opportunity to design their own project become eager to create a product which displays their learning over the summer. Once in my freshman year, I was given an option to complete a teacher-assigned book report, or to construct an independent book report. Being allowed this opportunity made me eager to chose a book that satisfied my interests, and not be punished to endure reading a four hundred page book about trivial history. This point illustrates the impact that student-designed summer projects can instill, without the students feeling punished by the school. Learning should be a process of critical thinking and analysis, however when this process is interrupted by an external predetermined body it is detrimental to one's education.

Student-designed projects promote cooperation in classmates and encourages them to continuously learn with their contemporaries. Cooperation is a skill which gives people the ability to build upon each others strengths and weaknesses, and is the source of many significant discoveries. Often we see that the scientific community caters to its researchers by promoting peer-reviewed journals and research to be conducted. This sentiment holds true with education in America. In order for students to learn over the summer, they should be encouraged to produce their own projects with individuals whom they spend their time with during the summer. I recall being pestered by taking on the burden of conducting a lab report by myself, which caused me to feel stressed out and disengaged. One day in physics class, my teacher allowed me to conduct a lab with many of my friends to make the lab procedure dynamic. I found that by being with my contemporaries, I was inclined to learn more about physics, and to collect accurate and precise data. Students who create their own projects are allowed the opportunity to learn through cooperation, which betters suits them especially during summer break. Many students are already flustered by the work load they receive during the school year, furthermore projects in summer break should bring students together in learning not steer them away in frustration.

Students that design their own projects can prevent the monotonous structure of education in America. We've all seen the stereotypical depiction of education in today's society. Classes upon hallways upon schools of mindless zombies who've been bombarded with unfulfilling tasks, which demoralizes their sense to learn. Why should summer projects further foster this reality into summer vacation? Isn't the point of summer break to allow students to have time to themselves? Education is a crucial institution in America, however we must not mistake it for being the only source of learning. Learning is a life skill that ascends the classrooms and school hallways, and enters the hearts of students throughout this nation. To allow students the chance to dictate their own project gives them empowerment to extend curiosity and discovery to outside the classroom. Having done project based learning in school, I can undoubtedly state that the monotonous nature of school deprives students our freedom to learn without restrictions. Of course the material must be covered, the criteria and standards must be met and the exams must be taken, but summer time is different. Summer time should be the students' time, therefore permitting student-designed projects gives students the freedom to learn unrestricted without the monotone school structure.

Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed to produce engagement in learning, cooperation amongst students and disrupt the monotonous school-oriented learning process. Education has always been a field where curiosity, and desires to innovate have been facilitated to bring about improvement in society. We can't always judge the circumstances to which things are, without providing a valid solution as to how those things ought to improve. Summer projects is that annual cycle where this principle can be enacted in the future. Projects designed to be student oriented can reinvigorate that desire for young people to go research and explore, while shattering the illusion of what education is depicted to be in America. What better way can we allow the continuous process of learning over the summer, than by putting the keys of that exploration in the hands of the future generation?",0
"Okay, here's my essay:

Competition in the workplace can be a great thing. It makes us work harder and be better. When we're competing with our coworkers, we want to do a good job so we can be the best. It's like a race to see who can do the most work or make the most money. It makes us want to work harder and be better.

But sometimes competition can be bad too. When it's too much, it can make people stressed out and not want to work at all. It's like, why bother if someone else is going to get the promotion? Or why work hard if someone else is going to take all the credit? That can make people not like coming to work and not want to do their best.

But overall, competition in the workplace can be good. It makes us work harder and be better. It's like a challenge, and we want to see if we can do it. It makes us feel good when we do a good job and see that we're better than someone else. It's like, yessss, I did it!

I think that competition in the workplace is important because it makes us want to do our best. It's like a game, and we want to win. When we're competing, we're not thinking about how hard it is or how tired we are. We're just thinking about how we can do better than the other person. It makes us focus and be more productive.

So, in conclusion, competition in the workplace can be good or bad, depending on how much there is. But overall, it makes us work harder and be better. It's like a challenge, and we want to see if we can do it. And when we do, it feels great!",1
"Most people find that when they are faced with a hard decision, they seek advice from their peers. But why do we do this? As humans we are natural team workers this means whenever we are come in contact with a problem, or choice we work together to figure out the best possible out come. I believe that this is a very good trait to have because when we have a choice to make we learn the different perspectives of your friends, peers and learn all the mistakes and choices not to make.

Learning different perspectives when making a decision is very beneficial to you. You can find out all of the pros and good outcomes like money, seeing new places or you could learn all the cons like spending less time with family and loved ones, or being stressed out. I believe it knowing different perspectives and views becomes very useful and helpful when making sure that your choice will ultimately lead you to happiness. However you still need to be educated on all the ways to keep out of trouble and in check by learning all the mistakes and errors you can make when making a choice.

In the process of making a decision discovering all the areas where mistakes and errors can be made is imperative. learning how to go over every small detail could play a big part in your final decision like going over how much free time you will have, if you wont be dumped with work constantly. Learning how to handle situations with communication and problem solving skills will help you indefinitely when coming to a conclusion. Listening to other peoples mistakes also helps you decide when to actually confirm and make your choice because some people wait to long or they make their decision to fast and it ends up not working out in their favor. this also another reason why I strongly believe that taking advice from your peers when making a decision is a very important part of the process.

The decision making process while being extremely difficult is very important you make decisions everyday of your life like what your going to eat, what you are going to wear but some of your decisions might be more important. When it come to those big decisions, life changing decisions i believe that you should tackle those on your own but with your friends, family and experienced personnel. Taking advice helps change the way you think and sometimes chnages your whole mindset, in making a decision knowing every possible outcome and point of view could be the difference of your life being really awesome or it being misserable and depressing. Thats why I believe seeking advice is super beneficial when coming to a conclusion.   ",0
"Dear principal

Have you ever had a goal that was bigger than life well me and my friends have some to we want to play sports but these demands on B or better in all subjects is making that hard .we think that you shouldn't change the policy on B or better to B ,that would really make the players work over time and most would not have the time to play and to turn in B plus work.

by doing so the players would have a bad time and they wouldn't have the fun that these sports bring them.

With this new policy comes a lot of problems like some of the star players are C students and i don't think that they could Get a B in every class. most of the students not playing sports are below the C average and they have extra time to do it in twenty thirty maybe even hours more than most sports players in the school .Also the people who do have all B' s aren't playing sports because to caught up in work to get those b' s.

Most students will have to leave sports all together because they cant make the grades ,Maybe making the teams lose the best players in the school. Most of these kids are natural players taking this away will make them turn to other alternatives such as playin",0
"Exploring Venus is brilliant but on the other hand there are many dangers when it comes to studying it. In order to get samples of anything researches would have to go to Venus but it's not garented they will make it back to Earth, so they have to come up with a better idea because studying Venus is worth it especially since Venus is an Earth-like planet.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus could be the next palnet there is life on. If the researches discover that life could be held on Venus people could start traveling there and try to research more of the surface of Venus. "" Long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (Paragraph 4). There is a chance of life on Venus so thats why the author states that researching Venus is worthy despite the dangers.

Another way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers is that many reseachers are woking on making machine last long and doing some testing on them to see if the machines do last longer. "" Many researches are working on innovations that would alow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"" (paragraph 6). Those machines could study Venus for the reseachers and they wouldn't have to send anyone and risk the dangers.

Exploring Venus is a great idea but researchers should look for other things like machines, or create their own one that could survive the heat and Venus conditions so they don't have to send people and put them in danger because they don't really know what it's like there. If reserches put in hard work and study all of Venus, Venus could be the next Earth.",0
"I think others should join the program because you could help these countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more. Caring for the animals is a big job too they have to be watered and fed two or three times a day. Also many things need to be picked up like bales of hay and bags of oats. This is a really big thing to people to have our help. It is a good idea to try and help out.

I have experienced from my aunt Katies farm as a young boy, I worked very hard so that prepared me,but not for the dangers of the sea. My job is to cheak on the animals every hour,its not all that bad. One night though it was pretty scary i was making my hourly report to the captain and some things happened. It wasnt that bad but im glad im here today. There is also lots of time to have fun on board. Like on return trips when the animals had been unloaded. I also played volleyball and baseball games with the cowboys in empty holds.

These are the many reassons why i think others should try joining the program. You not only have to work, you get to have fun while working with others. It may sound scary but its not,once are used to it. It feels pretty good to get that kind of offer. Also just to be able to help out.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

This letter is to inform you of the idea of requiring students to perform community service. Community service is a good was to show others how our school wants to help out in our community. This can be fun, educational, a great way to have community service hours for the future, a great way to give people an idea of how SCHOOL_NAME is a great school, and a way to teach and inspire others.

Community service can be fun for everyone. Students can have fun with their friends while doing something for others. It is also a great opportunity for us students to make new friends, or grow closer to our old friends. This would also be a good opportunity for us students, the faculty and the teachers to grow closer as a family. If ICS were to help out at a soup kitchen, it would be fun for all of us to work together and cook, clean, and make others happy.

Community service is educational. While doing community service hours, students can learn how to do things that they didn't know how to do before for example; cleaning up litter at a local playground and at our church. This would give students a chance to learn about the environment and be more aware of the planet.

Community service is a great way to have service hours. Service hours are very helpful in the future. For example high schools, and colleges look at your community service hours and there is a greater percentage that you may get in that school. If they know that you are helpful to others, they would know that you would be helpful in their school.

Finally, community service is an amazing way to give others an idea of how much SCHOOL_NAME is an amazing school. If people see that SCHOOL_NAME students are helpful, and aware of the planet we live in, they would consider putting there child in our school. Not only would it make people consider this, but it would also leave a good reputation on our school and how it is run.

Community service is a great way to teach and inspire others. If somebody sees you in the street cleaning, they may be inspired to do the same. Also, you can teach and tutor younger children and give them more knowledge.

In conclusion, community service is good for the students, the faculty, and the school. It would help us, while helping other. It is fun and even educational. Community service would be a great way to show people how SCHOOL_NAME is a great school, and inspire other schools to do the same.",0

Dear [Senator’s Name],

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College system that we use to elect the President of the United States. In light of recent discussions about the effectiveness of the Electoral College, I believe that it is essential to maintain this system.

One of the main arguments for keeping the Electoral College is that it ensures that all states have a say in the election of the President. The Electoral College gives smaller states a voice by providing them with a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of their population size. This means that even if they have a small population, their vote still counts, and they are not overshadowed by larger states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in all states, not just in heavily populated areas. This ensures that the President represents the interests of the entire country, rather than just a few states. The President must win the support of a broad range of voters across the country, not just those in urban areas.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it prevents a popular vote that could result in a tie. In the event of a tie, the decision would need to be made by the House of Representatives, which could lead to a prolonged and contentious process. The Electoral College system prevents this by ensuring that one candidate wins a clear majority of electoral votes.

While some argue that the Electoral College system is outdated and undemocratic, I believe that it is still an effective way to elect the President. The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College to ensure that the President was elected by a system that was fair and representative of the entire country. We should not change a system that has worked well for over 200 years.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the Electoral College system and to vote against any measures that would move towards a popular vote. The Electoral College ensures that all states have a say in the election of the President, encourages candidates to campaign in all states, and prevents a popular vote that could result in a tie. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"First impressions are incredibly significant in our relationships with others. In my experience, our initial impressions can go a long way in dictating how we interact and interact with people in the future. For example, when I was introduced to a colleague at an event, she made a wonderful first impression by being friendly, engaging in small talk, and offering me some helpful advice. As a result, I found myself more comfortable talking to her in the future and was willing to reach out for advice on various projects.

On the other hand, a negative first impression can be difficult to overcome and can influence our perception of someone for a long time. The stories we tell ourselves about people based on first impressions can be hard to change, leading us to distancing ourselves from those we deemed unfavorable at first. 

Thus, it is clear that making a positive first impression can be incredibly important in developing and maintaining relationships with others. I believe that being conscious of our first interactions and taking the time to make a good impression can go a long way in cultivating strong relationships.",1
"In our world today people have so many emtions they use on a daily basis. Emotions can help someone figure out if a friend is upset or how their day is going. On the other hand Dr. Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois wanted to decode all human emotions. The way that he could decode emtions is through a system called them Facial Action Coding System. Being able to read peoples emotions can help people under stand and learn what someone is feeling.

Dr Huang wanted a better way to read peoples emptions, instead of reading every indavidual muscle in the face. Then having to figure out the emotions of thr person on their own. Having a computer system to detect the emtions is faster snd easier to detect. Dr. Huang and his collegue Dr. Sebe are ""exsperts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" The computer is built to construct a 3-D computer model of the face and all 44 muscles on the human face to detect what emotions. One reason why the system was built, was for class rooms. The system would identify the mixed emotions of the students and help solve the problems. The system would observe the students to see if they are bored, upset, confused, and more. Dr. Huang states ""Then it could modify the leason, like an effective human instructor. This system would help so much in the class rooms. Even tho the system would cost alot and would be awkward for it to watch your every face muscle. But the system would help in class rooms and to help the students with their problems and needs.

The Facial Action Coding can help generations of people in the future and their emtions. The system can help with fixing problem for students and even passient of doctors. Even tho people normally communicate through talking, alot of our communication is from the faces that humans make. The emtion system will forever change the way scientists look at peoples emotions and the way they feel emotionaly forever. ",0
"The planet, Cydonia was discoved to have a face-shaped figure that stretched two miles long! Although some people believe that alien-life or some life-form has occurred or is still occurring to this day. I believe that the face figure is just another natural formed landmass like several we have on earth. For instance the Middle Butte found in the Snake River Plain of Idaho has a lava dome which takes form of a messa.

In paragraph eleven of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", Garvin says, ""As a thumbs rule, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger then the pixel size, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what there were!"" This explains that there is no way of showing or providing any evidence of aliens or lifeform on Mars.

The author also mentions that Garvin says, ""It;s not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work."" In this paragraph nine it also consentrates about the angle it is looked apon. I feel like if it was hard to find the perfect angle and measurements to take a closer look at the face, there could have been mistakes made without realization.

Even though no one knows whether or not if there was or life on Mars or if there still is. The likelyhood of this theory is very low. There would have to be a water supply, nutrients to feed off of, sunlight, shelter, etc. for any living organisms to survive.

Everyone should be allowed to have their own beliefs, but sometimes people believe in things that are hardly believeable. This could help save time and convience for in the future whenever NASA finds solid evidence that there is no evidence of aliens on planet Mars. Even if NASA would like the fundings for finding existance of lifeform, it would also be a great discovery that there isn't because they could narrow the list of safe planets us ,humans, could live on if there was any kind of diaster to happen to our planet.

"As students are given less time to complete a task, the consequences of longer hours could extend from both mental, psychological and physical capacities. With a shortened period of time to learn, there could be a higher level of stress or burnout for a student. During longer hours, students have less time to engage in after school activities, which may potentially affect their development outside of academics and may further cause psychological and mental strain. At the same time, a shorter period with an extended hours could provide the institution with a more efficient way of teaching, as more content can be covered in a shorter span of time. It is important to balance the need for an enhanced learning environment with the other important aspects of a student's life that could be affected from extended hours.",1
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 I'm super excited to write this essay about why knowledge is more important than imagination. I know, I know, it might seem like a weird topic, but hear me out! 🤔

First of all, let's talk about what knowledge is. Knowledge is like having all the facts and information about something. It's like having a superpower that helps you understand the world around you. Without knowledge, you wouldn't know how to do things like solve problems, make good decisions, or even communicate with others. 🤷‍♀️ Imagination, on the other hand, is like having a wild and creative mind. It's like being able to dream up all sorts of crazy and amazing things that don't exist in real life. 🌟

But here's the thing: while imagination is cool and all, knowledge is way more important in the real world. Think about it! Without knowledge, you wouldn't be able to do things like build a house, grow food, or even fix a broken toy. 🛠️ You need knowledge to survive and thrive in the real world. 🌟

For example, take the COVID-19 pandemic. Without the knowledge and information about the virus, we wouldn't have been able to develop vaccines or treatments to help stop it. 💉 And without the knowledge of how to properly wear masks and social distance, we wouldn't have been able to slow the spread of the virus. 🚫

Another example is in science and technology. Scientists and inventors need knowledge of the world around them to create new things and solve problems. 🔬 Without knowledge of physics, chemistry, and other sciences, we wouldn't have things like computers, smartphones, or even electricity! 💻💡

So, while imagination is definitely important for creativity and inspiration, knowledge is way more important for survival and success in the real world. 🌟💡 So, the next time you're brainstorming ideas or solving a problem, remember: knowledge is power!",1
" Should individuals make their own decisions or seek guidance? While it may seem like making your own decisions is the best way to live your life, I believe that seeking guidance from others can be incredibly beneficial. In many cases, our parents have already experienced the challenges and rewards of life and can offer valuable advice and guidance that can help us navigate our own journey.

For example, when it comes to making big decisions, such as purchasing a car or deciding on a career path, it can be helpful to seek the guidance of someone who has been there before. Our parents have likely been through these experiences and can offer insight into what to expect and how to make the best decision for ourselves.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that making our own decisions is a crucial part of growing and developing as individuals. However, it's also important to seek guidance from others when needed, as it can help us make more informed and confident decisions.

I have always looked up to my older brother, who moved out on his own at a young age with a clear goal in mind. He was determined to succeed and worked hard to achieve his goals, all while still maintaining a close relationship with his parents. I aspire to be like him and strive to be a hardworking and self-motivated individual, just like him.

While it's important to make our own decisions, it's also important to remember that mistakes are a natural part of life. We will all make mistakes, but it's how we learn from them that truly matters. By embracing the idea that mistakes are a natural part of life and that we can learn from them, we can grow and develop as individuals.

In conclusion, while making our own decisions is an important part of living our lives, it's also important to seek guidance from others when needed. By seeking guidance from those who have already experienced life and its challenges, we can make more informed and confident decisions. Additionally, by embracing the idea that mistakes are a natural part of life and that we can learn from them, we can grow and develop as individuals.",1
"Dear

State Senator

I think that you should change teh Electoral College because it isnt really fare to our state trhat congress gets to pick our president. we as a state shoul get to chose on who we want to run our country, and who we want to be our leader. we should not have to pick the electors, why can we be the electors ourselves?

Some people might want there to be and Electoral College but what about the others who think that we should vote or the president and not for the election of a president by a vote in congress? 60% of the voters would prefer to direct election to th ekind we ahve know. We have to think about everyone in this case not just the ones that think the have control over everything. we should listen to everyones opinions, not saying you have to do what they say,but just listen to.

back in 1960, segregation in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy. In 1968, a shift of just 41971 votes would have deadlocked the election. The Electoral College was unfair, outdated, and irrational.                    ",0

Subject: Maintaining the Electoral College for Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system for presidential elections. The Electoral College, established as a compromise by the founding fathers in the Constitution, ensures a fair and balanced representation of voters across the United States, and it remains essential to preserving our democratic system. While some argue in favor of a direct election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is an integral part of our electoral process, providing several advantages that should not be overlooked.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees the certainty of the election outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's passage, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This mitigates the risk of prolonged disputes and ensures a smooth transfer of power. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to contested and disputed results, as witnessed in the 2000 presidential election, which further highlights the need to maintain the stability provided by the Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation and not just a single region. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner in his defense of the Electoral College, no region has enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president. This requirement forces candidates to have trans-regional appeal and incentivizes them to campaign in diverse parts of the country, making them accountable to the interests and concerns of a wide range of states and demographics. This fosters a more inclusive and representative democracy, benefiting both populous states and smaller states alike.

Thirdly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. As Judge Posner argued, the winner-take-all method of allocating electoral votes prompts candidates to target swing states, where voters play a crucial role in deciding the outcome. This ensures that candidates engage with the concerns and priorities of these states, leading to a more informed and thoughtful electorate. Additionally, by focusing on swing states, candidates are motivated to appeal to moderate voters since swing states tend to be politically diverse. This, in turn, encourages political moderation and compromise, which is key to a functional democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a political balance for large states. Due to the apportionment of the Senate, large states already have less representation in Congress per capita than small states. The Electoral College restores some of this balance by providing more attention to large states during campaigns. By allocating more electoral votes to states with larger populations, the Electoral College ensures that candidates dedicate resources and engage with the concerns of these significant constituencies.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. As Judge Posner noted, the system avoids scenarios in which no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast, thereby producing a clear and decisive winner. This eliminates the complexities and costs associated with run-off elections, offering a practical solution to potential electoral deadlock.

Although critics argue that the Electoral College suppresses the influence of voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, I believe the widespread participation in elections demonstrates that American citizens value expressing their political preferences. Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to create broad-based national campaigns, ensuring that even states often seen as ""safe"" for one party still receive attention and consideration.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system plays a pivotal role in our democratic processes and should be maintained for presidential elections. It provides certainty, encourages trans-regional appeal, emphasizes swing states, balances political influence between large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While improvements to the system can be considered, such as addressing state laws on elector selection, the core principles of the Electoral College remain crucial to preserving our democratic values and ensuring a fair representation of voters across the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College system and to support its continued implementation for presidential elections. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The question of, ""should the development of these cars should continue or not"" is actually a pretty good question. The fact that this is fairly new and raises some questions like, ""will is be safe, will it be better to use than a regular car, and how far in development can this actually provide us with?"" We can really predict the futuce, but we can be able to know what might happen based on what we know right know.

Google, and most likely other car maker company, are trying to make this driveless car a reality. But how will they go about doing this? First, it's good to mentioned that it is not yet completely driverless. It runs with sensors and cameras to see the area around it, along with GPS to guide it where ever you want to go. Comes with many other things that is ""to minic the skill of a human at the wheel"". Why is that important? That's important because that's what makes the car to be driverless. They have. Basic idea and model and it works perfectly fine. It mentioned, ""their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"" and they are still finishing the final product. More things are going to be added on to make sure it is 100% safe to be in.

Is it better than a person? Well i think that it could become better than a human driver. Humans can crash into things all by accident, just because they went to fast or press the gas on fowards instead if backwards. Many things can happen on the driver's fault. Minus any accident outside of control, like a tree had fallen down on your car, the driverless in theory could serve as a way to decrease crashes or accidents. If it works the way it should, the mostion sensors and cameras could detect things and hit the brakes before anything happens. Although it isn't completely driverless, meaning it mentioned in the article, ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but are desIgned to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" and even if it isn't yet completely driver less, when the designers and creators finnally make it for there is not need for human assistants, the car could theoretically be safer than a human driver. Did you accidentally ran your car to someone else's? The driverless car sure didn't. Did you fall into a hole you didn't see? The driverless saw that from GPS and sensors p and avoided it already. Just things that can enhance the car to make it safer to be holding a baby or really elderly person in.

Why is this good for us? Well, imagine that the world is now use to this ""driverless car"" and is safest thing because of it's enhancers. People could hop in one and go anywhere knowing that they will be safe and arrive safetly. It is just more convinant to have, when being on auto-poilet, you can do anything you wish like calling someone when needed to, play games on a screen that could be provided, any more entertainting things that destract you with the boring, yet safe, ride. It it mentioned ""some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and infirmation systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone.""

The idea of having a driverless car is actually a great idea once you think about it. With many upgrades and remodels, the car can and will be safe to use. It can be better than a normal human driver, and the options and things it can do to give us during the ride is a lot more than a person driving himself. This car will be the best thing that could happen to the roads and transportation.",0
"When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to several people for different opinions. Asking for advice from different people and getting different opinions is helpful because you get different points of view on what you are asking, it may help you make a unique decision, and to reassure what you may have been thinking to begin with.

Firstly getting different points of view on what you are asking can help you because you are hearing all these different peoples answers which may make you change your mind. It may change your point of view on the way you was thinking about what you were asking for. Gives the person multiple different answers and opinions to chose from so that you can make the right choice.

Additionally reassurance is always good when asking others for advice. Reassuring may help you find someone who was thinking the same thing which is good for making decisions. Seeing if what you were thinking is relating to what others are thinking so that you can make a decision that is not crazy and does not make since. Making confident decisions is good so that you are not second guessing it and changing your mind about your decision.

Furthermore unique decision making is always helpful. Unique decisions stand out from what others may be thinking. When asking others for advice you have the ability to make your decisions the opposite of what most others are thinking so that your decision is different than all the other decisions. Showing creativity in your decision is very unique because you put all of your creative thoughts in one decision which always makes it better.

In conclusion talking to different people for there opinions can make a creative decision, give you different points of view on what you were thinking for a better decision, and gives you reassurance. All these help make better choices for your decision making, and asking others for there advice can always help with yours. So that you always are making the better and right decision.        ",0
"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star"", is the closest thing to Earth as far as the base planets go. It is often called Earth's twin, even if it doesn't seem that way. The surface temperature is nearly 800 degrees Fahrenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth. This being said, scientists are still fascinated by Venus, as it could have been just like Earth long ago. Despite the dangers it presents, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because it could lead to many scientific discoveries, and set foot on another planet and gather data, and see what happened to Venus and possibly find out how to prevent it from happening to Earth.

Even getting to Venus may seem like a stretch, but keep in mind that it is at times the closest planet to us, which is important considering the long time frames of space travel. Furthermore, even with the harsh surface temperatures, there's a way around it. A vehicle hovering Venus would still be able to get data about the planet without burdening itself with the the tough conditions. Even if this can only provide limited insight, scientists are working everyday to on technology that lasts long enough to be able to get meaningful samples such as soil, rock and gas. For example, NASA has developed simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus-like conditions, and they lasted about 3 weeks in the harsh temperature and pressure. Another project is looking to the past to mechanical computers, computers that don't use electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. They could be made to withstand the conditions of Venus, while also taking data and making calculations for study.

Although there are many challenges that need to be overcame and scientific breakthroughs that need to be discovered before we even think about sending anything to Venus, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because of the discoveries it could hold. From regular rock and gas to preventing a catastrophe, scientists should continue to study our sister planet, and see what's really beneath the surface. ",0
"The potential use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology in classrooms to read students' emotional expressions is a complex issue with reasonable arguments on both sides. 

Proponents could argue that FACS provides teachers valuable insight into how students are feeling during lessons. If a teacher knows that many students appear confused or bored by a particular lesson, FACS data could help identify areas for improvement. It may also help teachers recognize students struggling with issues outside the classroom and ensure they receive appropriate support. FACS could be used to gauge students' enthusiasm for certain topics and tailor lessons accordingly. 

However, others may argue that constant emotional monitoring via FACS invades students' privacy and is developmentally inappropriate. Classrooms should be safe spaces for students to freely explore ideas without every expression being watched and analyzed. Continuous facial scanning could add unnecessary pressure and stress. Students' emotional states may be influenced by many unrelated personal factors outside of the teachers' control. Relying too heavily on quantitative facial data also risks oversimplifying the complex interplay between pedagogy and human psychology. 

Overall, there are good-faith perspectives on both sides of this issue. While FACS technology could potentially provide useful insights, concerns around student privacy and pressure would need thoughtful consideration and safeguards. A balanced approach may be to trial FACS monitoring with an opt-in program requiring parental consent, and evaluate both benefits and drawbacks. But widespread mandatory use risks doing more harm than good to students' well-being and freedom of creative expression within the classroom. The potentialinvasion of student privacy is a serious concern that needs to be addressed before adopting this technology.",1
" High school students should not be allowed to graduate with a three-year program because it can create additional stress and pressure on their already busy schedules. While some students may have a job or extracurricular activities that require their attention, graduating early can still be challenging and demanding.

One of the main reasons why graduating early can be stressful is that it may require students to take on more advanced courses that are more challenging and require more homework. Additionally, some students may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or tests that are critical to their grade, which can take away from their ability to participate in extracurricular activities or spend time with their families.

Another reason why graduating early can be challenging is that students may have to juggle multiple responsibilities, such as work or volunteering, in addition to their academic pursuits. This can be especially challenging for students who have to balance these responsibilities with their extracurricular activities, which may require them to stay after school or commit to community service projects.

Furthermore, graduating early can also impact a student's ability to attend college or pursue higher education. While some students may be ready to move on to the next stage of their education, others may need more time to prepare and develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in college or beyond.

In conclusion, graduating early with a three-year program can be challenging and stressful for high school students. While some students may have a job or extracurricular activities that require their attention, graduating early can still be demanding and require additional time and effort. Therefore, it is important for high school students to take their time and graduate with their class, allowing them to fully develop and prepare for the next stage of their education.",1
"One of the biggest advantages of limiting cars is the positive impact it would have on our environment. As mentioned before, the increasing levels of greenhouse gases, pollution, and smog are a result of the excessive use of cars. These harmful emissions not only contribute to climate change but also pose serious health risks for individuals. Respiratory problems such as asthma and lung cancer have become more prevalent due to the poor air quality caused by car emissions.

By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and create a cleaner and healthier environment for all. This can be achieved through the promotion of alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and the use of public transportation systems. Many cities around the world have already taken steps in this direction, implementing bike-sharing programs and improving their public transportation networks to provide convenient and sustainable alternatives to car travel.

Additionally, reducing cars can also have a positive economic impact. As the essay mentions, owning a car comes with a range of expenses, including the cost of purchasing a vehicle, insurance, fuel, and maintenance. These expenses can quickly add up, especially for those who rely on their cars for daily commuting. By transitioning to more sustainable modes of transportation, individuals can save a significant amount of money and allocate their resources towards other important areas of their lives.

Another key advantage of limiting cars is the improvement in safety. Car accidents are responsible for thousands of deaths and injuries each year, making it a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Drunk driving, distracted driving, and aggressive behavior on the roads are all factors that contribute to these accidents. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can ensure safer streets for everyone. Public transportation systems and alternative modes of transportation offer a safer alternative for commuting, as they are generally driven by professionals and are subject to strict safety regulations.

Moreover, reducing cars can help promote a sense of community and social interaction. With fewer cars on the road, people are more likely to engage in activities such as walking or cycling, which encourages face-to-face interactions and a sense of belonging within the community. This can have positive effects on mental health and overall well-being, as social connections play a crucial role in our lives.

In conclusion, limiting cars can have numerous advantages for our world. By reducing car usage, we can make a significant positive impact on the environment, save money, improve safety, and foster a greater sense of community. Considering the current environmental challenges we face, it is essential that we seriously consider alternative modes of transportation and work towards reducing our dependence on cars. Through collective effort and individual choices, we can create a more sustainable and harmonious future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"The author is has lots of good points that were very interesting in the passage. He or she adressed that although it is moving up in the world and it is bring us closer to the future they're a lot of faults in this idea. We maybe able to create a car that is able to drive itself and is able to hand a normal road but in paragraph 7 it states that ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"", this means that we are close but we still have a little longer to perfect the driverless car. The main problem is what the author was trying to inform us about in paragrah 9 is if we get into an accident while on the road whos fault would it be the driver or the manufacturer? This creates a very big promblem with the public and the manufacturer, which can only be settled in the court house. We all want to see the future and what it can bring,but this example alone shows us the difficulties that we aregoing to face in order to move up in the world.

Some manufacturers are trying hard on this idea and are creating these cars and are testing them out some examples of these manufacturers would be BMW, Nissan, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz are all trying in the idea. Nissan, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz all plan on having cars that drive themselves and will maybe relseased to the public in the year 2020. This is very close to us and it is exciting to know that there will be a future car that will be able to drive its self but, the public will have to be very careful with the car and so does the manufacures. Im excited for a car that will be able to drive its self but, I am very sceptical about this idea it will have to very safe for the driver and it will have the driver on the alert for a very long time. Good luck to the public and good luck to the manufacturers in my opinoin you will need it. ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think the students should take a responsibility to do some community because it would help the world and the school a lot. Many people litter and trash the place and they shouldn't because it would cause pollution. It wouldn't be fair to the people who clean the streets or the janitor in our school. This is why I think the students should clean after themselves and help the community like everyone else has been doing. I also think it would be a great idea because then the people wouldn't have to became worried all of a sudden and complain that the world or our school is a disgusting and smelly place. That's why people and the students should help clean and care for there schools as they would with their houses. Maybe also some of the teachers could help also. It would be great for everybody and everyone in the community.

Examples: - Recycling Unused Paper

- Erasers and Pencils could help other kids

-

Newspaper from the teachers could recycle

Other people in the world could use the things we have. Also kids that are less fortunate could use the recycled products and use them for their classes as well. We also have to be grateful for the things that we have and that were not starving, or dying . That the world has given us a chance to help and give to others as we do to them. Its a good thing we do to because no one knows what's going to happen to us by tomorrow or maybe even today. Anything is possible. That's why every student should help in the community and our future. Also to help our community people could tutor or help someone that is in need of our help. That could probably help us when were older and they probably will thank us later. So its never too late for the students to do a kind thing in our community. That's why I thank people who stop and check if I'm okay just in case I fall, break a leg, or even become sick. So that's why I say this over and over so people and students could stop and do something kind in our community, it could be useful. Not everyone has this chance.

Sincerely,

"Dear Principle,

I would recommend using ''Policy 1'',because students bring their phone to school anyways.

If you do allow students to use their phone at school at free times they would like school a lot more. Especially teens they would love the fact that they can use their phones at school during a free time. A lot of students today get in trouble for bringing their phone to school.

There are some good reasons for students to bring their phones to school. Here's three examples, example one, they might for get their gym clothes, so they'll wait until a free time to call their parents to drop their clothes off. Example two, a student might get hurt at school and no one is around, all they'll have to do is pull out their cell phones and call their parents . Example three, A student might stay after school for tryout's or something and didn't tell their parents. Instead of having their parent worried sick about them they can call them and tell them where they are.

If you use policy 2 students will bring them anyways. The more trouble students get in , the more work you'll have to do. So let them bring there phones to school. They'll love it! If you do allow them to bring there phones to school they'll text there friends and tell them about it, Then there friends are going to move to your school. The more students you have at your school the better. So please let your students take there phones to school.

Sincerely yours,

"The Seagoing Cowboy program is a program where you help people in destress who don't have food. This program is a great program helping people is what you do. Not only helping but somtimes you get to check out the place where you were sent so it is also like a vacation.

I think you or someone you know should join this program. I think it would be fun because in the text Luke Bomberger who was a former Sea Cowboy he got to go site seeing and check out some pretty cool places. One of those cool places is the Acropolis in Greece. Another reason you or a person you know should join is because in the text luke says that after you are done delivering the resources you get to play games and tournements on the boat. Also it is a good way to use time while on sea.

The Seagoing Cowboys are a huge help when there is a big crisis and the real thing that matters is that you are helping people out that is a good thing to remeber. Those are my reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program and you will not regret it.",0
"Students would really benefit from being able to attend classes from home. One of the reasons that they would benefit is that if they are sick and cannot make it to school, they can still get notes and talk and learn from home, they still have that option when they cant attend school. Another reason is that if they are far from the school district and can't make it to the school they have online school, there they can still learn and participate. Last reason is that they have a better learning experience from themselves and having a one on one conference call so they can ask as many questions as they can because some people learn better like that. All these reasons support me on why schools should offer distance learning and how it would actually benefit students on learning and different situations.

My first reason on why school's should have distance learning is if they cannot attend school for sickness or any medical reason and just cannot be there. Many students get sick and are unable to come to school, but with distance learning, I think that students would be able to get what they missed and still learn from they days they have not been at school. Sometimes students get into injuries because of sports or just need a mental break from school and stay at home. Some students would feel safer and better at home, and it would be really beneficial for them to have that option of distance learning from home.

Another reason is that if the students live far from a school district and can't make it because of transportation. Some students live out in urban areas and there are no close schools to them and they should have an option to have distance learning. Other students don't have the transportation to get to school. While other students need to stay home for whatever reason and just can't make it to school. This would really help students in rural or urban areas or students that don't have a school close to them.

Last reason is for students that have a better learning experience from a one on one conference call or just like learning by themselves. All students have many different learning styles and one of them would be self learning through watching videos. Other students would have better help not being in a classroom and just having a one on one conference call with a teacher and they can get the most help they can get than being in school. It all depends on the students learning styles but students with these would probably be very beneficial to them.

In conclusion, all these reasons show how and why distance learning can be very beneficial to students. Students that are unable to attend school for being sick can still learn from home. Other students that dont live near school or are near a school district can still ""attend"" school and learn. Many students have different learning styles and self learning students and having one on one calls with teachers would really help them instead of them being in class or school. I think distance learning is a great option for students for these reasons and school should have them as an option for students to choose.",0
"I believe that summer projects should be designed by teacher's. Summer projects are meant to keep students minds engaged so that when school starts back up again in the fall, they are ready to hit the ground running. Studies show that 76% of students who have summer projects get 22% higher test scores in the first quarter. Parents who have shared their input with schools about summer projects also say that their children seem more engaged for the entire summer. Parents who have children that don't receive summer assignments have said that their children lay around and do nothing all summer. Teachers should design summer projects because they know what is going to be taught in the upcoming year, and they know how challenging to make summer assignments in order to keep students engaged all summer long.

Teacher's start making their lesson plans before their school year even starts in order to be prepared for he upcoming year. If teacher's are preparing for school to start up again in the summer then why shouldn't students be preparing for school during the summer? When students don't come prepared on the first day if school, it sets off a bad tone for the rest of the school year. When students aren't prepared to start learning then they start off behind everyone else who did come prepared. Summer assignments keep students minds in shape over the summer so that they are prepared to start learning on the first day of school. Teachers should make these summer assignments because they know what is going to be taught in the upcoming year, therefore they know what the students should be working on over the summer in order to give them a head start for the whole school year.

A lot of teacher's have started teaching right when school starts, especially in high school. Because of this, students who don't show up prepared to learn right away start the entire year off on the wrong foot and sometimes it's hard to ever get back on track. So to combat this, teachers assign summer projects that are challenging enough so that students still have to work to complete the assignment but not so difficult that it's impossible. Teachers should design the summer assignments because they know how challenging to make the summer assignments. Students who aren't challenged at least a little over the summer also come to school unprepared to hit the ground running. So in order for students to be properly prepared to start learning on the first day of school, teachers should design the summer project.

Some people may disagree and say that students should be able to design their own lesson plan because hey know how difficult their assignments should be. If students were to make their own summer assignments they wouldn't be prepared o start learning right away. A lot of students would make their assignment so easy that they could finish it in 10 minutes while others would make it so difficult that it would be impossible to finish. Teachers would know how hard to make a summer assignment based on how the student performed in the previous year and what they need to be prepared for in the upcoming year.

Teachers should be the people to design summer projects for students because they know what the students will be learning in the upcoming year and they know what the students have already learned. Summer assignments are meant to keeps students minds in shape s that they are ready to start learning on the first day of school. When students make their own summer assignments, they tend to be ill-prepared to start learning immediately. Teachers know what's best for their students so teachers should make the summer assignments.",0
"Dear Principal,

I recently heard you wanted to change the school policy on sports and other activities, so that only students with a grade average of a B or higher can participate.

First of all i think this is wrong, because then students won't have as many after school activities.

After school activities help occupy students time which makes it less likely for them to get in trouble.

Another reason is that students might also drop out or move schools so they can continue playing sports.

If students don't have sports they are also less likely to get enough exercise which could cause more obesity in the school.

Some students rely on sports as a chance to spend time with their friends, so if sports are cut out they may become antisocial and have no friends.

When people play sports it also makes them more motivated to do other things and gain more friendships.

Other activities in which students may not be able to participate in such as electives or school clubs may drop the self esteem of students due to lack of friends with similar interests.

this rule might also cause bullying because if someone can't play sports then others will know they have less than a B average.

Getting regular physical activity in a friendly surrounding also helps people who might have had a troubled past.

When others around to support one and other it also brings up the moods of possibly depressed people.

When activities are available it also helps students broaden their horizon by letting them try things they might not have otherwise tried.

it also allows students to meet people with similar interests.

This policy might also be good because it would give students with poor grades a reason to bring their grades up to atleast a B average.

It also could allow there to be more academic centered clubs.

The students who aren't eligible to play sports could also have tutors in the time they aren't spending on sports.",0
"Enthusiasm is an essential element of achieving success in any aspect of life. It is the driving force that propels individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. In this essay, I will argue that enthusiasm has a significant impact on success and provide examples of Cristiano Ronaldo and my mother to support this claim.

Firstly, enthusiasm is the spark that ignites the fire of motivation. It is the passion that drives individuals to pursue their dreams and work towards achieving their goals. Without enthusiasm, individuals may lose interest in their pursuits and give up too easily. Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the greatest soccer players of all time, has always been known for his enthusiasm on the field. He is constantly moving, shouting, and encouraging his teammates, which has helped him to become one of the most successful soccer players in history.

Secondly, enthusiasm helps individuals to overcome challenges and setbacks. It is the ability to stay positive and keep pushing forward even when things get tough. My mother is a perfect example of this. She has always been enthusiastic about her job as a nurse, and even when she faced challenges and setbacks, she never lost her enthusiasm. She continued to work hard and provide the best care possible to her patients. As a result, she has been successful in her career and has made a positive impact on the lives of many people.

Thirdly, enthusiasm helps individuals to be more productive and efficient. When individuals are enthusiastic about their work, they are more likely to be focused and motivated. They are more likely to put in the effort required to achieve their goals. Cristiano Ronaldo is a perfect example of this. He is known for his work ethic and his enthusiasm on the field, which has helped him to become one of the most successful soccer players of all time.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is an essential element of achieving success in any aspect of life. It is the driving force that propels individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. Cristiano Ronaldo and my mother are perfect examples of how enthusiasm can have a significant impact on success. They both have always been enthusiastic about their pursuits and have worked hard to achieve their goals. As a result, they have both been successful in their respective fields and have made a positive impact on the lives of many people.",1
"why should i take your advice when you won't take mine. When people ask for advice some time's it better, they ask more than one person as suppose to one person. my question is why is it better to have more than one advice from other as suppose to one person. My first advice is asking advice from people isn't bad because you can ask the people close to you they. second you can whether or not you want there help because it's your choice. My last advice is that you can ask as many people as you want. when asking for an advice make sure you get both side of the argument,

When asking for an advice from people you want to ask you'r self know it's not bad but as long as you ,can you trust them or not. Be careful making that decision because some people could be jelouse of you. They might have wanted to have the same role in the play that you got. Your stuck on whether to join the play or stay with you family and help them out. they might take advantage of you'r distress ,and offer you advice that could stress you out more. They might say that if you go join the play how will your family feel. How would it feel of they left you think about that .they could also say how will they get by if your not around what will you do ,and start to make you have negative thoughts about your self ,and more they would have put more pressure on they decision your about to make . But as to when you ask some one you trust ,and you know that even if they wanted the same role as you they would give you they best advice. They could tell you that if you go you can make more money and help out more as to if you were here they would spend more money on you because they town doesn't have high paying jobs. they might tell you not to go and say that if you went and didn't make it big and came back home will you be able to help them ,or what if you went to a dangerous place and you got harmed your family would be in more dept because ,they will have to pay for your hospital bills. with there advice you could be able to make you'r decision

My second advice is whether you want there help or not. The reason why am saying this is because if you want there help but you think you can make the decision your self when it can impact you. What i am about to tell you is from my experience, when i was picking my courses for middle school course I was debating whether I should ask my family for help. I decided not to and it cost me because when i was picking my classes i picked all A.A.P's thinking I knew what I could do . on the first day of class the teacher gave us a quiz on pythageron theorem ,and I thought that it was easy ,but i kept answering trying to solve the question i couldn't solve it I was freaked I didn't know what to do so i guessed and turned it in. When I got the test back i got 75% instead of dropping out the class, I kept on staying in the class after a while of failing my family told me to drop out ,but i didn't and i failed the class.

My third advice is ask as many people as you want, as my grand farther used to say ask as may people you need to ask before it final. what am trying to say is that is you are unsure of your self or other's you can ask as many people as you need and figure out what you want to do. When i was in 5th grade, and wanted advice i would ask five people, but i was all ways unsure. So i would ask more people for their views ,and idea's because i asked them i was more sure of what i wanted to do. So what ever you do maybe ask for help many people have different views just make sure when you ask people you know you asked as many people as you want when asking for an advice make sure you get both side of the argument, because just cause you like on side because you have all of your favorite people on it doesn't mean you have to look there way. when asking people for their advice you have to make sure you can reason with them ,and the and see things from their prospective. always look both ways because you can always miss some thing because when i was a 3 grade I would always let my ball roll down hill in our back yard.

one day it rolled onto the road i ran to get it ,and if I hadn't looked left and right I would have die because a car was coming a top speed.

in conclusion what am trying to say is by this is when asking for advice you should talk to more than one person,after all 2 heads are better than one because al am saying is asking advice from people isn't bad because you can ask the people close to you they. you can chose whether or not you want there help because it's your choice. And third is that you can ask as many people as you want. and last you can always have more than one view because you never know when you might need to take this advice to hearth ",0
"I think for some kids, learning from home would be a good thing because some kids are always distracted and messing around with there friends.

I think for a lot of kids doing your school online at home instead of being in school would be beneficial. Because lots of kids come to school to hangout with their friends and have no intentions of learning anything.

So for those kinds of kids online school would be a good option for them.

Online school would also be good for the kids dont go to class and just wonder around the halls, or just dont go to class in general. What is the point of them even coming to school? If they arent gonna go to class.

If a kid gets in trouble for skipping school all the time then what is the point to keep getting them in trouble? Just make them do online school at home since they want to come school. No one can force any body to do anything different people have different minds so the think differently.

So online school in my opinion is good for some people, That's the people that always are getting distracted, skipping school, and at school but never in class because he/she are always wondering around the halls.",0
"Do you think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? People should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program beacaue of these three reasons because they would get to go on many adventures, also because they would get to meet new people, and also they would get to experience new places.

They should join the program because they would get to go on many adventures. The text states it was a great adventure for luke.

also if they join the program they would get to meet new people. The text stats ""it made me more aware of people other countries"". The text also states that lead him to keep meeting new people.

"It is proven that 65% of people in the U.S benefit from advice of others. When people give you advice you expect it to be useful and something you would do and benefit from. Some people may not be the right person to look for when it comes to advice. I think that seeking advice from multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you get different perspectives, you know better for the future, and your friends know whats right and wrong for you.

Getting different perspectives helps you make a better choice because you can learn from others experience. When someone has already done something it proves that it can actually work so that advice could be good if they have already experienced something. Using the advice from several people that have already been through what you are going through are the best people to get advice from.

Advice can help you know better for the future because you learn from your mistakes. Learning from the mistakes you have made can make you stronger and a better person. When you know the mistakes you have made you know who to get advice from because they helped you fix those mistakes. You can be more open minded with the advice given to you. Think through why you should do it how and be more away about the scenario.

Receiving advice from your friends are probably the best people you could ask for advice. Your friends know what right and whats wrong for you. they will protect you from the bad and guide you to whats good. The more you talk to your friends the more trust you gain. You can also build a stronger bond by talking to your friends.

In conclusion, advice can benefit almost everyone and it can be hard to find whats right for you but in the end you can find it. Looking for many opinions can help someone look for the right desicion by having different perspectives, knowing better for the future, and having friends know whats right and wrong for you. ",0
"Imagine not being able to go to school and see your friends. Although you might feel comfortable at home,doing your school work from home can be a big distraction rather than doing your work at school. Some schools allow students to attend classes at home but doing than can cause laziness and can be disturbing to the brain. Students should not be allowed to attend classes at home because, students might get more distracted if they do their work from home, students might understand better if their at school, and you can get physical help from your teacher.

To begin with, allowing students to do there class work from home can be distracting. For example, Generic_Name has really good grades and his behavior is astonishing so his counselor and his teacher decided since this was happening he could take his classes from home. Generic_Name and his parents thought this was a great idea until two weeks later when his teacher and parents started to see his grades drop. Generic_Name's parents were beginning to think it was his teachers fault, but it was Generic_Name's fault, he was so distracted by video games and other things he didnt really make time to do his school work. So if Generic_Name would have stayed in school his grades would have looked the same.

Another reason, students might understand better. There are some students who might not understand something, but there to scared or shy to come out and say it. so allowing those who dont really talk to stay at home and take there classes at home what makes you think that they want to be stared at through the computer. For example Generic_Name is a very shy person but she gets her work done. She often struggles with her class work she feels that if she takes her classes through a computer screen it will attract more attention to her an she would be laughed at.

Then, you can get physical help from your teacher. There is nothing wrong with getting help from your teacher, but even then if you take your classes at home how is the teacher going to help you it would be harder for the teacher to because, she might not know what you need help on. You might feel like your going to disturb the class just to ask for help from a computer screen.

So although schools might think it would be better to take your classes at home remember that, students might get more distracted if they work from home, students might understand better, and you can get physical help from your teacher. ",0
"Do you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing on an assignment or don't know where to start and you have nobody to help you?

Teachers should not allow students to design their own projects over the summer because if a student designs the project they would not know what to do and be unorganized, it's more efficient for the teacher to assign and grade, and finally teachers can assign you topics you have already went over in class. However, some may not agree on this position. Some points to take in consideration are that not all students will like the topic and may not know a lot on that specific that's assigned.

Firstly, when starting a new project students may not know what to do. For example, in my Vietnamese class I was assigned a project that was on Vietnam's geography. I was very confused on it because we had to do it on our own without any help or an outline. I didn't know where to start, where to find the information, or how choose a suitable location.

In addition, it is more efficient for the teacher to assign and grade. For instance, if your teacher gave you the opportunity to do your own project it would be very difficult to organize. The teach would have to create individual rubrics because every student will most likely have a different type of project. It would also be hard for the teacher because the teacher has to deal with a variety of different topics.

Consider this as an example, teachers can assign you with topics they went over in class. An example of this would be if a teacher assigned you a project based on a topic that you've already went over it would be a lot easier for you to accomplish and understand.

In conclusion, it is better for teachers to design projects for students because if a student designs a project they would not know what to do, it is more efficient for teachers to assign and grade, and finally teachers can assign project that you've already went over in class. Students should prefer teacher-designed based projects because it's less work for them and the teacher.",0
"School is a place of learning. It can also be a place to get to know new people. But school lacks student participation in after school activities. Our principle has decided that all students should participate in at least one after school activity. The reason why students should participate in an after school activity is sports, students council, and the yearbook.

The first reason why students should participate in an after is sports. Sports is a great way for the school to be recognized by colleges. Scouts from colleges will want to come to our games to draft kids into their college. Sports will also get the school trophies for students to brag about. Because of all of the trophies the other school sport teams will recognize the school as an actual challenge to go against.

The second reason why students should participate in an after school activity is the student council. The student council can encourage the school to do more fun activities for the students. The students council represents the students, so the students will be able to have a voice. Therefore the council will know what to focus on for the schools.

The final reason why students should participate in after school activities is the year book. Having students as photographer will mean they will take decent pictures. With a lot of students in the yearbook club there will be many pictures to pick from. The yearbook club will make sure students will have memories of the school.

The reason why schools should participate in an after school activity is sports, student council, and yearbook. Sports will help students get recognized by scouts, the sport team will be an actual challenge to beat, and the school will have a lot of trophies. The student council will try to get more fun activities, students will have a voice, the student council will know what to focus on. The yearbook will get students to take good pictures, because of the number of students the yearbook club will have a lot of pictures to choose from, the yearbook club will make sure the students will have memories of the year they had at school. The school needs more participation from the students. With a lot of people participating in after school activities it can make the school a more fun place.",0
I think that considering changing the school policy is a good thing because then kid's would have good grade in school and they would still be able to do other activities in their school. Kid's should try to have a B average in school. They would get so many rewards with there parents like they would give them all they want if they had good grade. Having B average is something that i would be proud of and so would be my parent. Sometimes its just hard to do everything right all the time and try not to get anything wrong and do all your homework and make your teacher happy by doing everything they say. But sometime they can be really annoying once they tell do this they tell you to do other thing i mean can u make up your mind lady. Well yea all of that can get really annoying. All of theses thing they want us to do and when we don't do it right they get mad. Yeah having B average can pretty hard to keep. Well its still a good idea because it can prepare you for collage and other hard things to accomplish in the future and help you be a better person.      ,0
"Title: ""Intergenerational Learning and Bonding Program""

Introduction:
As an 8th grader, I believe that it's important for students of different age groups to learn from and bond with each other. Recently, I've learned about various group programs that facilitate intergenerational learning and bonding, and I think it's time to create a new program that does this in an even more effective way. In this essay, I will outline a new program that allows students to learn from, teach, and bond with each other.

Program Overview:
The program I propose is called ""Generations United."" It's a weekly after-school program that brings together students of different ages, from elementary school to high school, to learn from and bond with each other. The program will take place once a week, for two hours, and will be led by a trained facilitator.

Step 1: Learning from Each Other (30 minutes)
In the first part of the program, students will have the opportunity to share their experiences, interests, and hobbies with each other. This will help students learn from each other's perspectives and gain a deeper understanding of their peers' lives. For example, younger students can learn about the challenges and joys of middle school from their older peers, while older students can learn about the latest trends and technologies from their younger counterparts.

Step 2: Teaching and Sharing (45 minutes)
In the second part of the program, students will have the opportunity to teach and share their knowledge and skills with each other. For example, older students can teach younger students how to play a new board game or how to use a specific software program, while younger students can teach older students how to draw or paint. This will help students develop their teaching skills and feel more confident in their abilities.

Step 3: Bonding Activities (30 minutes)
In the final part of the program, students will participate in bonding activities that promote teamwork and collaboration. For example, students can work together to complete a puzzle or play a cooperative game. This will help students build relationships and develop a sense of community.

Conclusion:
The ""Generations United"" program will provide students with a unique opportunity to learn from, teach,",1
"Do you think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in any technology today? I think that the Facial Action Coding System isn't a value because all technology is NOT 100% correct. There ould be a time when the computer glitches and mess up. Its not just a computer that glitches, its all electronics. Such as phones,tablets,video games and any other electronics you can think of. The FACS has no use because you can tell when a person is sad or mad or even angry.

Even if a person dont show facial expressions on how they feel they will feel that way deep inside. For example, students could be happy coming to school talking to their friends,just be in happy mood but when they get home they are depress and they start to act different. As days go on this student is changing as a person and people start to notice when you change. Everbody has different facial expressions each day if a person is not feeling that day they will show it. You can't use a computer just to show how people feel. The computer can tell people that your happy just because you smile all day but really your mad,sad,and depressesd but no one will ever know because of the way that the technology is set up. i still feel like the FACS shouldnt have never been created.

i still feel that way because,like the text stated ""you can probably tell how a friend is looking simply by the look on their face."" you can also tell when you hang around a certain person everyday and they start to change and their facial expression start to change, their body language will also start to change. Just because you smile alot dont mean your happy .When you smile you muscles in your smile starts to change but that don't mean your happy your still sad. if your were to get tested on the machine they would considered you happy just because you smile alot but really you just depressed .

i know all of this imformation because when im at school i get serious and focus on my school work. During lunch i laugh and play with my friends and giggle all the time but when im at home its a different story. By me being the middle child i get treated differently so i always look angry when im at home . 95% of the time i try to keep a smile on my face but the other 5% i try to stay away from, because i dont want to be angry all the time i wanna be happy and make other people happy too. if i was to get tested the computer would say 100% happy.

No one should use the FACS if they know how they feel. Everybody know what wrong with them and what their issue is. You shouldn't need a machine to tell you something you already know. I know im not the only one that feel this way but everybody has their own opinion. This concludes on why i feel like the FACS should of NEVER been created.",0
"There is way to forget all of the school work and do something a lot more funnier during the day its called doing an extracurricular. For example, you had a very boring day in all of your class's ,and having that extracurricular like a sport could set you in a different mood. I strongly agree having an extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's a good use of free time away from the school work, future careers ,and it would be fun for the students.

An extracurricular is a great way to get away from school stress. There are some days students have to do nothing but sit down and write for the whole day. Research says that doing this same cycle everyday will not help students intake information the right way. Having this extracurricular is also a lot like having your brain rest to better process that information.

A extracurricular would be great for students looking for more experience for future careers. like joining the student council or doing a sport. For example joining the students council is like taking ownership of a job ,and doing a sport like football, soccer and wrestling start to get young athletes to get a lot better. An extracurricular can be very helpful in the long run.

Having a extracurricular would be a lot of fun for students picking what they wanna do. Like some students that have a heart for sports or if other students want more of a challenge joining the student council may be fun for them. Research says that when your're a lot more happy you are more awake and ready to learn. If all the students did an extra curricular it would for a fact brighten their moods.

In conclusion, having a extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's fun and it would get more students to wanna do it. Its a good use for free time and to take a break from school work. Helps out a lot of students for the real world. ",0
"dear senator:

the electoral college most be important that makes the people to chose what do they want it consists to make the people take their own desiton about who do they want to help them and make their lives better in al the ways, the electors have to be near the people of the town or city cause in that way the people feels more closer to them and they can trust the work of the electors.

the certificate of ascertainment declares that the winnig presidential elector in the state ans whows which elector will be represent the state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year,that means that you help choose your state's electors when you vote for a president because when you voete for you candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.

after a presidential election , the governor prepares a ""certificates"" of ascertainment""

your state are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidental election.

on source 1 the author is trying to explain how does this works,to help the people of the town and especially that if you vote that means that you are helping to the elctors and that probaly wil not help if you dont choose the correct person.                                             ",0
"As we should know, ""the Electoral College is a process not an actual place. It serves as a compromise of the presidential election in Congress and by popular vote"" paragraph 1. It can be good at times but most times it has its downfall. The Electoral College doesn't allow for a direct election compared to popular vote. Also, there isn't a fair number of votes for each presidential candidate per state. If there is a tie in the electoral voting process it can cause a big disaster. I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall?

First of all, the Electoral college isn't a direct election. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Paragraph 10. In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of malapportionment"", paragraph 21 voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itself.

It's not only an indirect election but it's also an unfair election. The number of entitled electors per state is based upon the members of the state's congressional delegation. ""One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators."" paragraph 3. This is unfair because the number of ""House"" members is based on the states overall population compared to the amount of senators. It may somehow be good for the residents who believe their votes doesn't count because of the candidate's regional appeals but what about those who fear that their electors won't choose the candidate in which they favor.

Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process. If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives"" paragraph 12. This is an unfair method also because now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause controversy in the public. ""The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued"" patagraph 22 but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the ""most thoughtful voters"".

All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfall. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" paragraph 14 and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.",0
"The Electoral College has long been a contentious topic in American politics. While some argue that it provides a fair and balanced system for electing the president, others firmly believe that it undermines the principles of democracy. While the existing essay highlights several valid concerns about the Electoral College, it is important to delve into further arguments in favor of replacing it with a popular vote system.

One of the primary issues with the Electoral College is that it can lead to the winner of the popular vote losing the election. This was most evident in the 2016 election, where Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes, but ultimately lost the Electoral College to Donald Trump. This stark discrepancy between the popular vote and the electoral outcome undermines the principle of one person, one vote, and raises questions about the legitimacy of the system.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters a winner-takes-all mentality, whereby candidates focus their attention on battleground states and neglect others. As the essay rightly points out, presidential candidates often prioritize swing states and densely populated regions, leaving smaller states or those that consistently lean towards one party to be largely ignored. This not only leads to unequal representation, but it also means that issues affecting specific regions or demographics are not adequately addressed.

Moreover, the Electoral College fails to capture the diversity and complexity of the American electorate. It perpetuates a two-party system, sidelining third-party candidates and alternative viewpoints. By prioritizing the winning candidate within individual states, the Electoral College discourages independent thinking and incentivizes strategic voting based on the perception of which candidate has a stronger chance of winning. This effectively suppresses dissenting voices and limits genuine choices for voters.

Another crucial aspect that the Electoral College neglects is the evolution of technology and society. The system was established at a time when communication was slow and cumbersome. Nowadays, we live in an era of instant digital communication and efficient data processing. With the advancements in technology, it is entirely feasible to accurately count and verify individual votes on a national scale. The implementation of a popular vote system would reflect the progress we have made as a nation and embrace the full potential of modern technology.

Furthermore, the Electoral College inherently disenfranchises minority communities. By giving disproportionate influence to swing states and large population centers, it marginalizes the voices of those in smaller states or minority communities. This inequality is at odds with the principles of representative democracy, as it perpetuates systemic biases and leaves certain groups feeling unheard and unrepresented.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an antiquated system that no longer serves the best interests of a modern and diverse nation like the United States. It undermines the principles of democracy, creates an imbalance in representation, and fails to adapt to changing technological advancements. By transitioning to a popular vote system, we can ensure that every vote is equal, eliminate the winner-takes-all mentality, and truly reflect the will of the people. It is time for the United States to embrace progress, uphold the principles of democracy, and replace the Electoral College with a popular vote system.",1
"In order to ensure a healthier future for our planet, it is vital that we continue to explore alternative modes of transportation that are eco-friendly and sustainable. One of the most promising solutions is the development and implementation of public transportation systems. 

Public transportation, such as buses, trains, and trams, offer a more efficient means of transportation compared to personal vehicles. They have the potential to transport larger numbers of people at once, reducing traffic congestion and decreasing the number of cars on the road. This, in turn, can significantly lower harmful emissions and improve air quality in cities and urban areas.

Cities like Copenhagen in Denmark have already embraced a public transportation-focused approach. Their well-developed and efficient public transportation system has dramatically reduced the reliance on personal vehicles. As a result, the city has witnessed a decrease in air pollution and an increase in the overall well-being of its residents. 

Additionally, investing in the expansion of bike-sharing programs and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure can further encourage people to opt for alternative means of transportation. Promoting walking and cycling not only helps to reduce pollution but also contributes to a healthier population by encouraging physical activity. This can lead to a decrease in obesity rates and related health issues, further benefiting individuals and society as a whole.

Furthermore, governments and urban planners must prioritize the development of sustainable cities and communities. Introducing green spaces, building energy-efficient structures, and implementing measures to reduce waste and promote recycling are just a few ways we can make our cities more environmentally friendly. By designing cities that prioritize sustainable transportation options and minimize the need for personal vehicles, we can limit the negative impact of transportation on our planet.

Lastly, it is crucial to change our mindset regarding personal vehicles. While they may have once been seen as a symbol of freedom and status, we must recognize that they come at a great cost to the environment. Choosing to prioritize the collective well-being over individual convenience is essential for a sustainable future. Education and awareness campaigns can help shift public perception and encourage people to make environmentally conscious choices when it comes to transportation.

In conclusion, personal transportation is not a necessity but rather a luxury that is contributing to the degradation of our planet. It is time for us to take action and prioritize more sustainable modes of transportation. By investing in public transportation, promoting active transportation options, building sustainable cities, and changing our mindset, we can create a healthier future for ourselves and generations to come. Let us work together to protect our planet's health and ensure the survival of our species.",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

What I think about community service is something that a lot of people do around the world. In church school the nuns tell the people in church school to do community service do that we help the nuns in everything or we clean the garbage that is thrown in the floor. My friend OTHER_NAME use to do community service when he was still in church school he was dong community service. I never did that when I was in church school. Some people say is fun cause you meet new people and you learn new things in the world. People that I know still do community service. They say that sometimes they get paid when they do something. you could even do is when there is snow on the ground and nobody have shoveled the snow you should do it . If the person was a old person and they cant do it themselves.

We help other people that's something nice you could do. I help a little second grader do his homework but he has problems. When he's writing his hand start to shake a lot now is a year helping him now his hand doesn't shake at all. His parents say that he have learned a lot of things from me and I'm happy that they say that. My mom say to thank god that I got that job now I could buy something with my own money that I need to buy in school or clothes or shoes that I want. That's why when I grow up I wanna be a teacher I'm learning to be a teacher with the little kid. It's fun and you remember everything that you did in elementary school. Sometimes you forget but you remember or the little kid shows me.

People could even help the old person taking they're grocery to the car. You could do a lot of things for community services. You could wash the dishes for your mom or clean the house. they're a lot of things you could do. I think that Ms. TEACHER_NAME

should let us have community service. People are lazy to do community service. Because they just wanna chill around with they're friends and they don't do they're homework. I do my homework every Friday I don't like doing it Saturdays or Sundays. I always get lazy or I go and chill with my friends. My mom doesn't like me being in the house locked so she lets me go outside and chill with my friends or I go with her to go shopping to the mall or we go to my brother house. I use to like being locked now I don't cause my head starts to hurt I feel like if I was in jail. The people that are bored being at home should do community service.",0
"As an 8th-grade student, I have experienced the challenges of balancing school and other responsibilities. It can be difficult to find the time to attend classes in person, especially when you have a job or family obligations. However, attending classes online has many benefits for students in these situations.

Firstly, online classes allow for flexibility in scheduling. This means that students can attend classes at a time that works for them, rather than being tied to a set schedule. This is especially important for students who work during the day or have family responsibilities. It allows them to balance their education with their other commitments without having to sacrifice one for the other.

Secondly, online classes can be more convenient for students who have to commute to campus. This can save time and money, as they do not have to travel to and from school. It also reduces the stress of dealing with traffic or public transportation, which can be a major source of frustration for many students.

Thirdly, online classes often offer a wider range of courses and programs. This means that students can choose from a variety of options that may not be available at their local school. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a specific field of study or who want to take a course that is not offered at their school.

Finally, online classes can be more interactive and engaging than traditional classroom settings. Many online classes use a variety of multimedia tools, such as videos, simulations, and interactive quizzes, to enhance the learning experience. This can make the course more engaging and enjoyable for students, which can lead to better academic performance.

In conclusion, attending classes online has many benefits for students who have jobs and family responsibilities. It allows for flexibility in scheduling, convenience in commuting, a wider range of course options, and a more interactive and engaging learning experience. While there may be some challenges to balancing education with other commitments, the benefits of online classes make it a worthwhile option for many students.",1
" While it may seem counterintuitive, being inactive can actually serve a purpose in our lives. There are several reasons why I believe that being inactive is important. Firstly, it allows us to rest and recharge, which is essential for our physical and mental well-being. Secondly, it can provide us with an opportunity to catch up on any work or tasks that we have been putting off. Finally, it can give us time to pursue hobbies or interests that we enjoy.

One of the main benefits of being inactive is that it allows us to rest and recharge. When we are constantly on the go, we can become exhausted and run down. This can lead to a range of health problems, including stress, anxiety, and depression. By taking time to rest and recharge, we can help to prevent these problems and improve our overall well-being.

In addition to rest and relaxation, being inactive can also provide us with an opportunity to catch up on any work or tasks that we have been putting off. For example, if we have a lot of paperwork or emails that we need to go through, we can use this time to get caught up. Similarly, if we have a project or task that we have been working on, we can use this time to finish it up.

Finally, being inactive can give us time to pursue hobbies or interests that we enjoy. Whether it's reading, painting, or playing an instrument, there are many different ways that we can use our free time to relax and have fun. This can help to improve our overall mood and well-being, and can also provide us with a sense of accomplishment.

In conclusion, while it may seem counterintuitive, being inactive can actually serve a purpose in our lives. By taking time to rest and recharge, catch up on work, and pursue hobbies, we can improve our overall well-being and lead happier, more fulfilling lives.",1
" To be true to myself in this world, I do not necessarily need the people around me. I can continue with life on my own terms. All the achievements I have accomplished are a result of my own effort and determination, without the help of those around me.

In this world that I inhabit, I cannot trust anyone because instead of wishing me well, they wish me harm. People sometimes act negatively because they are influenced by external factors, such as societal pressure or personal experiences. School may not always help me become someone in life, but it provides me with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed.

To achieve success, I do not need the approval or support of those around me. An example of this is when I had a friend named Generic\_Name, who was once a positive influence in my life. However, as time went on, she began to change and encouraged me to skip school with her. She had a history of misconduct with her parents and continued to engage in negative behavior. I eventually stopped talking to her because her actions were no longer aligned with my values.

To be successful in this world, I must work hard and persevere, even in the face of adversity. Yesterday, I took a test with my classmates in math class, and one of them asked me for help. While I wanted to assist him, I knew that the teacher would be upset if I did so. After the test, he approached me and began to complain. I told him that he should have studied more and that people would not always be there to help him.

Another reason for success in this world is to never give up, even when others tell you that you cannot achieve your goals. For example, I am graduating this year, and my cousin has told me that I will not graduate because I am not very smart. While her words may be discouraging, I know that I am doing my best to graduate, and that is all that matters. Sometimes, I want to cry because of her negativity, but I remind myself that I do not need anyone else's approval to be successful.

In conclusion, I believe that being true to myself and achieving success in this world does not require the approval or support of those around me. While people may have their own agendas and motivations, it is ultimately up to me to make the most of my own abilities and pursue my goals",1
"Did you know that extracurricular activities can help you in many ways? I think that extracurricular activities should be prioritized more. For example, schools should help kids out by having them do extracurricular activities like a sports team. I agree that my principal should require every student to participate in an extracurricular activity so their brain can get stronger, they can have some physical fitness, and so they can have a safe place to go after school.

First, an after school activity could help students build their brain power and help it get stronger. In a extracurricular activity like chess club, the students could build their brain. In the chess club, students learn strategy and technique which are good life skills and helps build their brain. The brain requires strategy so it can do anything in the best way possible or the quickest way. Technique is also important to the brain so it can do things efficiently uniquely.

Also, certain extracurricular activities could help students get more in shape and help them learn fitness skills. For example, an after school weight lifting class teaches the kids good technique and how to get in shape. All students need good technique when lifting weights because otherwise they could get seriously injured. These type of classes also teach kids how to get in shape or stay in shape so they can live a healthy and happy life.

Finally, after school activities help kids have a few extra hours out of their toxic home or their stressful personal life. Some students come home every day wishing they could go back to school. These students come home to abusive parents or just siblings who act like bullies. For them in a extracurricular activity they could escape that and create family like relationships with their teammates or piers. The coach of the sports team also can act like a guardian type figure if their parents are never around or just don't care for them.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that the principal should require that all students should participate in one or more after school activities. These activities help every kid and every kid can find something helpful in a extracurricular activity. The kids who participate will live better and stronger lives.",0
"Dear principal,

I do not agree with having only B average students participating in sports and other activities. Since most students have a C average, it isn't fair to be having only B average students to participate in sports and activities. There are many different opinions that I have on this policy.

It is important to allow students to participate in other activities, not just for fun, but for health reasons too. As a growing kid, they would need to have exercise. I think it should be the parents decision to have their child play sports or not. I also think if students chose to participate in activities it could possibly help their education, the more they know the better it would be in any type of education.

Another reason I disagree is it would not make sense because there would most likely not be enough students to even participate and have full teams. That is not a good idea, because if no one can participate, that is not fair to the B average students. If most students have a C average instead of a B, you might need to work something out. A suggestion would be letting the kids with a C average participate, and below C average students could not.

A grade B is higher than average, so if you are expecting your students to get higher than a C that is expecting them to work on their abilities that they might not be able to fix. If students get a C average, they could be struggling, it does not necessarily mean they deserve to not be able to participate in sports and activities like other kids do. I believe that if this was made a new policy, it would be wrong and you should consider re-thinking another suggestion to change this.

I hope you will consider a new suggestion. Thank you for reading my opinion on the new policy you are considering.

From,

"A Word Of Advice

Why do people ask for advice? To feel reassured? Or maybe they just want help in their situation. No one will ever be sure of the answer why, but there are always specific people that you should get advice from. There will always be people in your life to give you advice. Parents, adults, teachers, and your legal guardian are always good examples. Dependency is a great thing and is used in day to day life. Its a great support system for tasks the might seem puzzling. Say you often second guess said persona's advice. You should always seek multiple opinions because sometimes you can get advice from the wrong source.

Everyone has had different experiences and everyone has their own opinion. For example you ask someone what the best food is at a restaurant you have never been to before. Well you dont want to be disappointed if you pick something you dont like so you should ask a friend for their opinion on the matter, but you should only get advice from the people you trust. What are one of best ways to get advice? Hosting a survey is a good example but not necessarily for personal topics. Surveys are a perfect way to collect data and get a wide opinion.

The internet is also another good place to get good advice. It has millions of topics ranging from medical advice to shopping advice. For example if you were sick and you didnt know what sickness you have the internet is a good way you can self diagnose. It can list treatment options and the time you might have to take for you to get better. Regardless on what it may be the internet is perfect for advice. Wikipedia is a website that has information on everything and is basically one big glossary for all topics. You can talk to millions of people over the internet and if you trust them enough asking them for advice can give you multiple answers, but they can surely help you find advice.

Multiple opinions can form a better choice. If you give power to other people to formulate an opinion it helps get a situation have a greater outcome. In America we use democracy to form our nation. Democracy is very useful and its what we use for our political tendencies. Voting is how we decide everything and it is a majority rule system. America's president every four years is decided by voting and is a very fair system. but its all opinion based and thats what makes it so great. America is fueled by the voice of its own people. But even that in its own way is advice.

At the end of the day advice comes in many different forms. It can be verbal, political and just plane out personal. Multiple voices formulate a greater outcome. Advice can be found anywhere and everywhere. Even though advice from others is great there is no better advice but your own, but you should always get your advice from good sources. But that is just a word of advice.",0
"The ""Face on Mars"" is Not an Alien Structure

Many people view the so-called ""Face on Mars"" as evidence of alien activity on the red planet. However, the features that created this illusion of a face are simply due to natural geological formations. When examined closely with modern technology, it becomes clear the Face is a natural landform, not an artificial construct created by aliens. 

One key piece of evidence is the scale of the supposed ""Face."" At around 1.5 kilometers wide, it would be enormous - far larger than any sculpture a civilization would build simply for aesthetic purposes. Such a massive structure makes little practical sense and would require immense resources to construct. A simpler explanation is that the patterns creating the face-like appearance emerged gradually over time from natural weathering and erosion processes acting on the different rock layers.

Secondly, images of the terrain from other angles reveal the ""Face"" is really just a small mountain, blended together with other hills and mesas in the region. When viewed from different perspectives, the face shape disappears and it's clear these are normal geological features interacting. If it were an artificial structure, the face pattern should be consistently visible regardless of viewing angle. As a natural landform, its appearance naturally changes based on perspective. 

Most compelling is the evidence from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which imaged the area at a much higher resolution than the Viking probes. At this scale, there are no clearly artificial patterns or symmetrical facial features. Instead, it shows irregular sloped cliffs and hills formed by entirely natural geological processes like glaciation and erosion over millions of years. 

In conclusion, while the ""Face on Mars"" briefly captured people's imagination as signs of intelligent life, a closer analysis based on scientific evidence reveals it as merely an optical illusion arising from hills and mesas only coincidentally arranging into a vague face-like shape. For a feature so massive, far more compelling proof would be needed to override the simpler natural explanation. Unless stronger evidence emerges, the ""Face on Mars"" can be confidently considered a natural geological formation, not evidence of ancient Martian civilization.",1
"Is the Face a natural landform or not? No one will ever know. Yes the Face in a natural landform. If you think that the Face was alien made than your wrong. This was not made by aliens it is a natural landform that has shadows that cause the lanndform to have such apperences as a nose, mouth, and ears.

The Face is just a landform because in the passage is says that with newer technology they would have been able to see other things on Mars. The passage says that the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The MSG had the best camera on it taking the best photos. Each of the pixels spans 1.56 meters compared to the 4 meters the best Viking photo that was ever taken.

After the first Viking photo was taken it instatly appeared on the JPL web site. When the photo appeared they noticed that is was just a natural landform and that there was no alien statue after all. In paraghraph three of the passage it states that ""Although few scientist believed the Face was an alien articfact"". That right there prove that the Face is not an alien articfact.

The Face is not an alien articfact. In the pasaage it states clearly in several different paragraphs that scientist dont believe that the Face is a alien articfact. Many people believe that the Face is just a natural landform. The eyes, mouth, and nose are all thought to be caused by shadows. ",0

"I have recently read an article by the name of ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨, and asked my opinion.

I believe they could be very dangerous, they´re many sensors and techology to do with the car, who is to say they couldn´t malfunction, or intercept waves a sentence from paragraph 4 indicates my fear,¨For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors....Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, rotatin sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors....¨ and much more.

I also believe the driverless cars could put the country in even more debt.

In paragraph six they state that¨Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.¨

The last time I herd the United States was eight trillion dollars in debt, should we really consider adding two hundred million per radar to that eight trillion?

I also would like to go back to the subject of malfuctioning.

If a driverless car malfunction, the company could possibly and most likely be sewed, we would have even more money added to that debt to try to prevent it from happening again and no one really knows spending all that money would even prevent it from malfunctioning again, and lastly we would have some very unhappy customers on our hands.

We could be talking riots, people wanting their money back, shootings, killing.

So many unanswered possibilites could go wrong with this idea and production of ¨driverless cars¨.

In conclusion I believe that ¨driverless cars¨ productivity should be shut down for what we don´t know could become of it in the future wether it be money, mobs of angry customers or people that have been offected by them.",0
"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are several reasons why cell phone use behind the wheel can be dangerous. 

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is incredibly distracting. Whether one is texting, talking, or otherwise engaged with their phone, their attention is pulled away from the critical task of focusing on the road and other vehicles. Numerous studies have shown that distracted driving due to cell phone use inhibits drivers' reaction time, awareness of their surroundings, and ability to follow traffic laws safely. Even hands-free phone conversations require some level of cognitive engagement that takes attention off driving. 

Secondly, cell phone use increases the risk of accidents. Texting while driving is especially risky, as it involves taking one's eyes off the road for prolonged periods. But even just talking on the phone or listening to a call increases accident risk significantly. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, texting while driving increases the likelihood of a crash by up to 23 times. Distracted drivers have caused thousands of accidents, injuries and deaths annually in recent years. 

Finally, banning all cell phone use promotes a culture of safety on the roads. Clear restrictions take the decision-making burden off individual drivers who might feel tempted to check a message or make a call. Other drivers and pedestrians deserve protection from those who would endanger others due to phone distractions. While some argue for allowing hands-free options, any cell phone engagement remains potentially hazardous. A total ban establishes a zero-tolerance norm for prioritizing driving focus over digital connectivity while in control of a lethal vehicle. 

In conclusion, the serious risks of car accidents, injuries and loss of life due to cell phone use outweigh drivers' desire to stay connected while on the move. For public safety and responsible transportation policy, cell phones should remain out of reach and out of use for all motorists. Distracted driving endangers everyone on the roads, so a complete ban is justified.",1
No i think having technology to read a emotional expressions of students. I think that is really not a good idea .

"You should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. THe electoral college system should not be kept anymore. The electoral college is a proccess that contains counting of electoral votes by Congress, selection of the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for Vice President and President. Keeping the electoral college college isn't a good idea because when voting the the people vote electors and not for a presidential candidate, and voters sometimes get confused about electors. Many people disagree and agree whether to keep the electoral college but its thier opinion.

When voters vote they vote for a slate of electors not for the president. Many people dont want to vote for a elector. They want to vote for a president because that is the main reson that they are voting. If people vote for electors then thier hopes might get down. Each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Just because the winner of an electoral vote wins doesnt mean the electoral vote wins the national popular vote. In 2000, George W. Bush and Al Gore were running for president. Gore had more popular votes than Bush and Bush had more electoral votes.

According to the article, sometimes voters get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Nobody wants to vote for the wrong electors because that isn't good for people who took thier time to go vote for a presidiential candidate. If many people vote for wrong candidates then they will want to stop voting because it isn't worth it.                                          ",0
"I believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is sort of valuable. It can either help someone or not. But it doesn't hurt to try.

To begin with,

I say sort off because, for one, you never know what a person is going through. If the computer can tell someones emotion why not see how they're feeling. If they're sad or depressed maybe you can help them in someway. But also, people might not want you to know how they're feeling. So using the computer's app, that is kind of disrespecting them in a way because they dont want you to know their emotions.

Also, I still think it is valuable because like a I said if they're sad you can help them. Even if they don't want you to know, you can still help them secretly though. They will recieve help without even knowing that they're getting help. Little do people know, alotof people who are sad tend to smile the most and just look happy. So, honestly i do feel like it is very valuable, people should use it. But not just anyone, maybe like doctors or specialist.

I think specialists should be the ones to use them because they can be the ones to help people and they actually know how to do so. In the passage it talks about how in some people it is easy to tell by their face expression what they are feeling. But sometimes it is hard, and i agree. That is why I do think it is very valuable to use the computer.

Lastly, I do think its useable. It helps by letting us know who is depressed or stuff like that. But like I had said, I belive it should only be doctors using it and not just anyone because people and kids are immature and we would not want others to make them feel worse. ",0

"When it comes to the issue of curfews for teenagers, opinions widely vary. Generally, a curfew is imposed for the purpose of protecting teens by limiting the amount of time they can be out of parental or adult supervision. Advocates for strict curfews indicate that this practice has potential benefits like reducing teen delinquency and crime, reducing the risks of young people falling victim to drugs and alcohol, and creating a sense of order and structure in a youth’s life. 

Critics of curfews argue that these rules may be counter-productive in some cases. For example, in places where curfews are strictly enforced, it can have a negative effect on the teen’s safety by causing them to flee from or avoid law enforcement during an emergency. In addition, it can over-restrict teens, hampering their ability to develop healthy time management skills and even negatively impact their academic performance.

Ultimately, it is up to parents and guardians to assess whether curfews are appropriate for their teens and how they should be implemented. When curfews are enforced properly and in moderation, they can be effective in promoting safety and instilling good habits and values in teens. Ultimately, curfews are just one of many tools available to parents and guardians to ensure their teens’ safety, wellbeing, and success.",1
"The technology is very valuable. It's actually quite amazing how something like that can pick up on peoples emotions. There so many ways that something like that could be very useful. Say such a teacher teaching in a college. It's hard to give all your attention to one student's confusion on something. It'd also be hard to be able to see if every student is paying attention and staying on task. But with this technology, it could help change that.

There are many ways that could change that, and that the fact is, it wouldnt take long for the computer to realize soemthing is wrong. A way it could help change that, is the teacher could easily switch on the topic he's speaking on. Most students when it's something they're not intersted in, seem to zone out and lose foucs. But if the teacher knew that most students felt that way, there's ways he could bring in something that they'd enjoy. Another way the computer could help is the teaching methods. It said in paragraph one, that they're wanting to make computre and human talking easier. One way is having a one one review, talk, or lesson. The Facial Action Coding System could easily pick up on when the student is lost or needs help.",0
"Dear Dr. PROPER_NAME

it has my attention that are school should have online classes and it could benefit us and everyone that dose't go to school any more. If there is a bad storm maybe they drop out and they don't have time any more should have online class for the extra help and it could be a step to a better future.

My reason are the long snow days and other weather problem online class it could give us the chance to take are time and not be rush by other people on online class.It could help student that don't have time for school any more because of work or they got a problem being at school. Maybe a student has to go out of town be of a family emergency but they don't want to get left be hind of the other people in class. They can do online work while they are way they could also ask there teachers for help online and do a video conference and it would be good because the student is getting a one on one lesson and can befit them.

Some people need this if there miss a class credit and they need before graduation it can help them. If they have a full schedule on the school day they can take it online so they can catch up and make it on time for graduation. a lot of people might what to finish school but they don't have the time any more online classes could help balance there schedule. many people want to take a class for the hack of it for a extra credit for maybe an advance diploma or if they just want to get out school faster and graduate. A lot of people would have a lot of time or not a lot of time because of work online class would be helpful for a lot of people.

Online class is the step to good education it could help people get jobs or save money for schools so teachers could have the extra cash for teaching students. Maybe there could be a person that can further are technology and help other people in schools. Online class could get people out of minimum wage and start earning more money. It could also make it a lot easier for people that are home school the information can just be proved online.Online class is a step to a better future and education for people.

Online class should be for are school and others so we can get that extra help. For people that don't have time to go or if school is in a bad snow storm so that way its a step to a better future. ",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have observed the challenges faced by my peers and teachers when it comes to balancing school work and other responsibilities. In recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether schools should extend the school day for a four-day week. While there are advantages to this proposal, there are also disadvantages that must be considered. In this essay, I will examine the benefits and drawbacks of extending the school day for a four-day week and make a recommendation based on my research.

One of the main advantages of extending the school day for a four-day week is that it would provide students with more time to complete their work. With an extra two hours in the school day, students would have more time to study, complete assignments, and participate in extracurricular activities. This would help to reduce the stress and pressure that many students feel when trying to balance school work with other responsibilities. Additionally, students would have more time to work on projects and assignments that require more in-depth research and analysis.

However, there are also disadvantages to extending the school day for a four-day week. One of the main concerns is that it would put additional pressure on working parents. With schools closing early on Wednesdays, working parents would need to find alternative childcare arrangements, which could be expensive and inconvenient. Additionally, some students may struggle to adjust to the new schedule, and this could lead to further stress and anxiety.

Another disadvantage of extending the school day for a four-day week is that it could put additional pressure on teachers. With more time in the school day, teachers would need to be more productive and efficient with their time. This could lead to increased stress and burnout, particularly for teachers who are already struggling to keep up with their workload. Additionally, teachers may struggle to find time to complete their syllabi and plan their lessons, which could lead to a lack of structure and consistency in the classroom.

In conclusion, while there are advantages to extending the school day for a four-day week, there are also disadvantages that must be considered. Based on my research, I recommend that schools consider the impact that this proposal would have on students, working parents, and teachers before making a decision. While an extra two hours in the school day could provide students with more time to complete their work, it could also put",1
"Multiple students participate in extracurricular activities, but not all of them are involved in these activities. I agree that every student must be involved in an extracurricular activity. Participating in an activity would keep students out of trouble, help them make friends, and learn form the activity.

Having students participate in extracurricular activities would keep some students out of trouble. For instance, the student might get into trouble when they are home. However, the activities would keep them occupied until their parents get home. The decision would give the students a chance to not get into trouble anymore. Ultimately, the extracurricular activity would be great for the trouble makers.

I have many close friends that I have made during extracurricular activities. I can talk to them about anything because I have grown close to them through extracurricular activities. I wish that I would have participated in activities sooner so that I could have had my close friends for a longer amount of time. With this decision, other students would have the chance to get to know each other and make friends, too. Having friends that enjoy doing the dame activities and being excited to do them with each other are a few reasons why I agree with this decision.

This decision can also present a learning experience for the students. There are so many extracurricular activities that they can choose and learn from. For example, a student might want to participate in volleyball. That student would have to learn how to play volleyball and learn all of the rules that are in volleyball. Another student might want to serve on the student council. They would have to learn the positions and the rules for that activity. All in all, students will learn from anything and everything in the extracurricular activity that they choose.

All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This activity would keep the student out of trouble. During the activities, friendships will be made that will stick with the students throughout their lives. The students will learn an abundant amount of information, and they will want to learn more. Some students might look at this decision as just another thing on their schedules, but most of them will look at it as a chance to try something new and have fun while doing it.",0

"The land form found on mars was most surrley created by natural land. It states in paragraph 3 it says ""huge rock formation...wich resembles a human head...formed by shadows."" It was an illusion created by the shadows wich make it look like thers all the fetures of a human head. But some people disagree and think that was aleins that made the head, but they didnt have claims or evedence that aliens are the ones who did it.

In paragraph 5 it says that the ""Face on Mars"" has since became a popular icon. It also states that some people think that it is boneified evedince of life on mars, but how can the bones or remains of these so called ""Aliens"" have suvived all those years it would have deteriated away by now.

A few scientists think that is was created by alein. Even know in the begining of the artical it talked about how it was just a shadowy illusion that made you think that is was human head. But now there saying that it might of acuttaly been created by aleins.

The scienstists are right because in the artical it rarely has evedence of aleins being the ones who caused this. Also the scientis have all the evedence and claims and facyts to clariffy that aleins didnt do it. It was just natural causes and illusions.                 ",0
"People use them to commute around various locations and it releases harmful emmissions. The object that is being reffered to is a car, a car is beneficial but people should limit car usage because it cuts down on pollution of the atmosphere and it is not as bad as it seems to not use a car all the time, and limiting usage of cars is starting to trend.

Cars release green house gas emissions that affect the ozone layer of the atmosphere. that is a main cause as to why people shoul limit car usage. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[the smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" as explained in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog . This shows that smog is caused a good amount by cars and has affected major cities around the world. it also showed that when less usage of cars happened there was a 60 percent decrease in congestion which is a big percentile. in paragraph 5 of the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

it is explaining that automobiles are a big part of the suburbs and is a affect on the efforts to try in cut down on green house emissions of cars. its states in the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, that ""passanger cars are responsible for 12 percemt of green house emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Some may argue that the percent of green house emissions produced by cars is not high, but in reality it is and the numbers keep rising. If people limit the use of automobiles the numbers can be cut down and reduce pollution in areas that have heavy amounts of smog, smog affects the health of people and is toxic. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as atated in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog this shows that driving is a major contributor to smog and can be reduced by people limiting the usage of cars.

limiting car usage is not so bad and can even promote a happier lifestyle as shown in the articles about limiting driving. ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way,'' said a media tyrainer and a mother of two whos statement is said in the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows even when the people of the community of Vauban, Germany, experince a fortuitous life style. '' Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a move,ent called ""smart planning"" as stated in the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

this shows that limiting car usage is a ""trend"" and it leads to a positive outcome that affects generations to come. People around the world are also taking up the movement of limiting car usage, in Bogotoa, Columbia a buisness man named Carlos Arturo said ''it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" as referred to in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota thsi shows that not only the advantages of limiting car usage is decrease in air pollution but can also benifiet the individual. 'If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment."" as explained in the article

The End Of Car Culture.

this is relatin to the pattern of how in America the buying of cars is going down since 2005. which as result of that ocurring has benifited or will benifiet the enviroment. This shows how more and more peole are traveling less by car.

The advantages of limiting car use far outway the disadvantages of not using a car. this means that people are duing more to commute less by car and more by eco friendly transportation like bikes. The limiting of car usage not only impact people now but will do so in the future of the world and if not changed will result in the mass pollution of the globe.    ",0
"The author idea is is it worthy to be studying Venus without putting people in danger.

I tink its worthy because if Earth can't be a place where humans can live they have to another planet where people can lve at.

Venus is called the twin of Earth because its close to Earth in terms and density. Many spacecrafts was sent to Venus but none of the spacecraft have survived more than a few hours. More than three decades no spaceship have touched Venus again . Venus is one of the plaents that is hard to study because of its tempurtures and reputation. Venus atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds in Venus are more challenging because the have highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

Also the temperatures average are over 800 degrees Fahrenhiet and the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than Earth. The conditions of Venus are more extreme than Earth. For example the environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has the hotter temperatures in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. even though high pressures and heat the weather present addtional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most like Earth planet in our solar system.

"Sometime in life , if we dont try new stuff, we will never succeed. The author, Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,"" Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow"", and i agree with him.

Sometimes in life to succeed , you have to be passioned.

If you are passioned, you will be better at everything that you do, also, we have to be passioned to look for new stuff that you will like to know more about and learn about it.

If you want to grow in life , you can't be scared,

sometimes for being scared of learning or asking a question, we miss big opportunities and stay stuck, also, dont be scared of what other people think about you.

Other people might say that if you are good in life right now , why would you want to learn something new?, and you have tell them that you want succeed in life,be better person, not like the average people that dont do nothing to be better in life.

Many times to grow and succeed in life, we have to try new things, we cant be stuck in the same thing for our whole entire life. The statement that Ralph waldo Emerson wrote, is very true and i agree with him, if we dont try new stuff , we wont grow in life. we have to be more passioned of our life and start looking for new stuff to learn, and stop being scared of learning because we are missing big opportunities.",0
"I dont not feel driverless cars are needed,because driverless cars are only going to make humans more and more lazy. There not safe for the driver or for the pedestrians. If the was to be a crach or the car were to hit someone who would be resonable the buyer to the car or manufacturer of the car? These are just some of the thing that could go wrong that the artical has pointed out.

There are also thing the artical didnt say like how meny job there getting rid of by making the cars driverless. There are job like taxi-drivers; bus-drivers; lemo-drivers and semi-dervers all out of jobs. Then you have people who aren't comterble not being the one driving and get car sick. What happend if theres ice on the ground and the car reads the spead limit as 60mps. It may break, but its going to slid and hit something or someone. There's also the fact what if someone doesn't have a driverless car and there trying to run a red light a human that was driving might be aware and stop, but someone in a driverless car are more likely not to see it because there mor then likely texting or playing on the phone then watching the road. Then there's a huge crash. These are someone of the little things no one thinks about because people think the more lazy we're able to be then the better off the world is, but its not.

I can see all the good things that can come of driverless cars but bad thing weight out over the good things. There isn't a way to be sure of the safty of drivers, pedestrians, and property. To meny things can go wong that if there was a human driver if wouldn't happen. Thing like driving slow in rain and snow or even being able to pay attention to the road the someone with the money to buy a driverless car is trying to run a light. I feel if we can't garanteed the safty of all perple animals and property around us im not for driverless cars. ",0
"Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors.

To begin, when we look at studies we find that when people use their cars immensely, there is a harmful effect in our atmosphere, also referred to as The Greenhouse Effect. France has been a major component to this harmful gas, as explained by Robert Duffer in the passage ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..."" In addition, Duffer continues to provide evidence to this claim by further emphasizing and comparing ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"" By including this simple sentence, we are fully aware of just how much harm pollution has done to the environment due to car usage in Paris. Moreover, the smog in Paris was so intense that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Although almost 4,000 drivers were fined, the smog had cleared enough by Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. This movement is also spreading to places such as Bogota, Colombia where they have a day free of cars with the exception of taxis and buses for example, in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza explains ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Many ideas are being formed to show that people care about what their harmful ways have done and are looking to find solutions to minimize the pollution and undo what wrong has been done.

Buying cars over the years has become quite an expense to everyone and has become somewhat burdenlike. By limiting and even canceling out the use of cars people have cut down expenses greatly. Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accommodate those who have made this decision by making public transit ""free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" according to the BBC in the article Paris bans driving due to smog. As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently. Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article The End of Car Culture when she includes ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when ""Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work."" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor.

Not only are the advantages of limiting car usage subtle however they are also direct and can have immediate positive effects on people. By making sure people do not overdo the amount they utilize their cars, they become less stressed, have a healthier environment, and save money. This issue is worldwide however, the solution is becoming worldwide as well creating exceptional results and care from car drivers and people are really thinking outside of the box to make magic happen.",0
"My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.

People who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.

If driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.

Having drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem. That might be a soultion to our probelm of accidents and it will still allow people to drive.

Another thing to think about is the laws that will have to change for these people to make these cars. Like speed limits and how the car will cars handle traffic in large cities. We alos have to think about if they are really a energy saver car or if it is just as bad as the cars we are using.

In conclusion, I think that this car shouldn't be developed for the reasons of safety. This car may have some very nice aditions to it but we still have to think about whats best for the drivers. The cars that we drive now can use some new technogly but having a driverless care kind of seems a little to extreme. People love driving so why not keep the cars we have today and just keep inproving to make them better for us.

But i feel like before anyone makes thier minds up about whether we should or shouldn't uses these cars that are driverless there needs to be more research done and tests to see how these cars work. ",0
"Hey there!  So, I guess you want me to write about why we need more school days, right?  Like, I know some people might think it's a drag, but trust me, having more school days is actually a pretty big deal.

First of all, let's talk about the benefits of having more school days.  Well, for one thing, we can learn more stuff!  Like, imagine being able to take more classes and explore different subjects without having to cram everything into a shorter amount of time. It's like, our brains can soak up knowledge better when we have more time to do it. Plus, more school days means more time to hang out with our friends and make new ones! 

But,  there are also some drawbacks to having more school days.  Like, sometimes we can get a bit burnt out from all the learning and stuff.  And,  some people might not be able to make it to school as often because of, you know, family stuff or whatever.  So, it's not like it's all rainbows and butterflies, you know?

BUT,  I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks!  Think about it, if we had more school days, we could actually learn more stuff and be more prepared for life in the long run!  Like, we could take more time to learn about different cultures and histories, and how to be better global citizens!  And,  we could even have more time to work on our projects and presentations, which would be, like, super cool! 

So, in conclusion,  I think we should totally have more school days!  It might not be the most popular opinion, but I think it's, like, totally worth it in the long run!  What do you think?  Do you think we should have more school days or what?  Let me",1
"There are several advantages in limiting car usage. It helps the environment, lowers the chance of crashing, removes stress, and also congestion.

A reason why limiting car usage is beneficial is that it helps the environment. In source 2, France reached several days of ""near-record pollution"". This is mainly because of the substantial numbers of cars in France. Since France is dependent more on Diesel rather than gasoline, it emits more pollution causing smog to be more evident. In paragraph 14, it states, ""...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."". China has far more than triple the population of France. Yet, France is able to reach the same level of smog as China. If an abundant amount of people continue to drive cars as the way they do, every country is going to have the smog problem Beijing and France are having. Also possessing so much smog is a safety hazard being that it limits your ability to see from a distance.

In addition, limiting car usage can reduce stress. In source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."". In source 3, Carlos Artuto Plaza quotes "" its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". It is not only one person who can vouch on the reduction of stress by limiting car usage. A woman in Germany and a man in Colombia can both agree on the idea that limting car usage reduces stress. When you dont drive a car as much you have less things to worry about. Like, Fearing the possibilty of crashing, running out of gas, dealing with traffic, and several more problems. If someone drives less you would have less stress (in theory). The idea of stress reduction is an amazing advantage someone recieves if they limit their car usage.

Reducing car usage can also lower congestion. In source 2, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after 5 days of intensyfying smog..."". The implication of limited car usage brought the congestion down 60 percent. That is a major advantage since there is a decrease in the number of cars on the streets. This reduces traffic and allows people to reach their destination sooner than they would if it was more congested. The drop in congestion means that there are less cars on the streets so there would be a lesser chance of crashing. This is a factor that can reduce stress. The reduction of congestion is a positive product of the limitation of car use.

In closing, the limitation of car usage gives the advantage of aiding the environment, reducing the likelihood of crashing, stress, and congestion.    ",0
"I would play basketball for the school because you get to play against other teams in other different schools. Also, your friends can watch you play. Playing basketball for the school is a good thing,for an example:Your getting sponsored,you get to participate in activities like drills,and you get to play against teams from other county schools. If you make it to the basketball team you have to be healthy because high school is different how you play from different other leagues and also you have to work out a'lot to get in a good shape so you can have a higher advantage on driving a lane or shooting a three on you opponents while playing basketball.

One important thing is that you gotta listen to your coach and have good sportsmanship because if you do,then you will have a perfect team to win the championship game because if you do good college coaches might scout and look for good players that knows how to handle the ball and play defense so they can prevent the other team from scoring. If you do really good on both of those things then you might have a good advantage that college coaches might pick you to be on the team.

My second favorite sport that i would choose would be football because in my personal opinion football is the best sport because you get to tackle people. If you participate in football for your school you have to go training because there will be defensive and offensive coaches that will be there to train so you can get on the team for high school football. In training,you would do dead lifts,hills,drills,weigh lifting,and scrimmages. You have to do those things because thats what coaches want to see,they want to see their players train hard because the players want to make the coaches know that they will work and train hard to make the team.

Finally, the best sport to choose would be football because it is a very aggressive sport and also the sport is very hard and you have to be a lucky person to make it to the NFL.This will be a very hard thing because you also have to do good school but if you dont the coaches might think about cutting you out of the team because they want your grades to be perfect. If you make it to college and you do good, you can be the luckiest people to be invited ti the NFL combine. But if you dont like football just pick basketball because it doesn't really matter what sport you wanna choose to play for your school.",0
"A relevant topic in today's society that many people often discuss is the reduction of motor vehicle use. Limited use of vehicles such as cars, buses, and trucks can have great effects on the environment. Most of the effects are beneficial to the environment such as the reduction of smog which can ameliorate the horrible impact we have already had on the environment.

According to source 1, limited use of of motor vehicles will be less harmful to the environment. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when you factor in the gas emission from the United States which is more than four times what it is in Europe. Source 1 also claims that less use of motor vehicles will lower people's stress and will make children more social because they will be able to play near the streets without having to worry about being hit by a car.

All of these sources claim that motor vehicle reduction will also reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions. One source that supports this claim is source 2, not only does Paris emit more greenhouse gases than any other city in Europe, they now have two days in which people who drive their cars are subject to a 22 euro (31 U.S. dollar) fine.

Bogota, Colombia is proving to be the most successful in attempting to lower greenhouse gas emission. According to source 3 car-free day has been started in which citizens may not drive their vehicles without being subject to a twenty-five dollar fine. Most citizens obey this law and the amount of traffic jams is reduced to empty streets other than public buses. The increase in amount of people riding their bikes caused sidewalks to be repaired and replaced which improves the aesthetics of the city. Several small restaurants and various other businesses saw an increased income. Along with sources 1 and 2, source 3 claims that citizens are less stressed when not driving a motor vehicle. Along with this statement. source 3 also claims that people will begin to be more socially active when they are carpooled to school and other places.

Source 4 takes place not in Europe, not in South America, but in our own country, the United States of America. In the last few years, the United States has seen a decrease in the amount of people driving motor vehicles. We have not, however seen a decrease on our impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. This is because though people are driving less, many people in this country drive large, gas guzzling Hummers and trucks which emit more gases than any other vehicle. If people stopped driving those vehicles, we would definately see a decrease in greenhouse gases. We've seen it happen in Europe because large personal transport trucks are seldom driven in Europe.

Many advantages will be seen when the act of driving a motor vehicle becomes rarer. These advantages include our emission of greenhouse gases, improved social interactions, people who are less stressed, and an overall more cheerful environment. Multiple sources make these claims, and many countries in Europe such as France and countries in South America have placed certain days in which citizens don't drive cars. These days have proven many of these claims that support the assertion that there are multiple advantages to limited car usage.                                ",0
"I think the 1st policy is better because kids should be able to have their cell phones because they want have to hide it anymore and, it can save teacher more class time instead of stopping then taking a phone that's like five minutes of learning the teacher just wasted. I like policy number one because we can deal with taking our phones out at free time. We also want to learn so we would turn the phones off. The teachers wouldn't have to worry about us talking as much because we would be able to text each other. We can study from our phones too that's another good reason why policy number one is the best. Another good reason we should have policy 1 because we might have to call someone if it's a emergency. Policy two is not the best because as i said earlier if a student gets caught with the phone during class time that stopping the whole learning process. Another reason why policy two is bad because what if someone had to call for a ride home and they didn't have their phone because the school wouldn't aloud that. So they decide to walk home and gets kidnapped. All of that could've been prevented if the school would've just aloud kids to have phones. The kids would be very thankful if we could just have our phones.",0
"Sometimes things need to change but not in this case. Im in favor of keeping the Electoral College, normally in situations like this you have to choose one way or the other. Not with this, the electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote as stated in Source one. I know that wasnt enough to convince you so let me explain my reasons why i think we should keep the electoral college. My reasons are certainty of outcome and it can avoid run-off elections.

To begin I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us certainty of an outcome. One of the reasons why this is possible is because there is a total of five hundered and thirty eight votes and thats an even number so it can happen. Many people might say what are the chances of that happening. Well it actually happend a few years ago back in two-thousand. One of the reasons for this as stated in Source three paragraph eighteen is ""that the winning candidates share of Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" As an example from the article Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis. I hope that this information has been able to push you to my side a little more but were still not done. This is one of my reasons why I think that we should keep the Electoral Vote.

Finally I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it can avoid any run off elections. This is good because it solves the problem of elections in which no canadite recevies a majority of the votes cast. Some people might try to convince you and ask you what are the chances of this happening and has it ever occured before? Well I can answer both yes it can happen and it has twice, ounce in nineteen sixty eight with Nixon and a second time in nineten ninty two with Clinton. Both had a forty three percent pluarity of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. Also some people might argue that the Electoral college might turn down potential voters. But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three ""this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election. Hopefully this has convinced you to keep the Electoral College. This is my final reason why I think that we should keep the Electoral College.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us a certainty of an outcome and also it avoids run off elections. I know there are alot of decisions to be made and many things to consider but without this Electoral College we are in big trouble and more problems than you can fathom are going to happen. But in the end this is your decison hopefully you make the right one.

"Title: My Plan to Achieve My Goals

As an 8th grader, I have set various goals for myself, both short-term and long-term. To achieve these goals, I have created a plan that takes into account possible obstacles I may face and identifies different strategies to address them.

Firstly, I plan to set aside dedicated time each day to study and complete my homework. This will help me to stay on top of my schoolwork and avoid falling behind. However, I know that this can be difficult, especially when there are distractions at home or when I'm feeling unmotivated. To overcome this, I will create a quiet and comfortable study space in my room, free from distractions.

Another obstacle I may face is procrastination. I often find myself spending too much time on non-essential tasks, such as scrolling through social media or playing video games. To combat this, I will set a timer for a specific amount of time, say 25 minutes, and focus solely on my schoolwork during that time. After the timer goes off, I will take a short break before continuing with my tasks.

Additionally, I plan to research available resources that can help me progress in my studies. This includes taking online courses or watching educational videos on topics that I struggle with. I will also seek help from my teachers or classmates when needed.

To monitor my progress, I will create a chart or spreadsheet to track my grades and progress towards my goals. This will help me to see how well I'm doing and identify areas where I need to improve.

Finally, I will take action and implement my plan regularly. This means setting aside time each day to work on my goals and sticking to my plan even when it's difficult.

In conclusion, my plan to achieve my goals involves setting aside dedicated time for studying, creating a quiet and comfortable study space, combating procrastination, researching available resources, tracking my progress, and taking action regularly. By following this plan, I am confident that I can achieve my goals and reach my full potential.",1
"Hey there, Mrs. Johnson! 

So, the topic for today's essay is about deciding on a career at a young age.  I think it's a pretty interesting topic, but I'm not sure if I'm totally on board with it.  I mean, I know some people who knew exactly what they wanted to be when they grew up since they were like, five years old, and it's like, wow, that's intense. 

But, on the other hand, there are some benefits to deciding on a career early on.  For one, it gives you a clear direction in life.  You know what you want to do, and you can start working towards it.  It's like, you're not just floating through life without any purpose. 

And, let's be real, some careers are really competitive, and if you don't decide early on, you might miss out on opportunities.  Like, have you seen the job market lately? It's like, insane!  You need to be prepared and have a plan, you know? 

But,  there are also some drawbacks to deciding on a career too early.  For one, it can limit your options.  Like, if you decide you want to be a doctor when you're ten, you might not be able to switch to something else if you change your mind.  It's like, you're stuck with that decision for the rest of your life. 

And,  there's the risk of burnout.  If you're doing something you don't really want to do, you might get burnt out quickly.  It's like, you're not doing it for the love of it, you're doing it because you feel like you have to. 

And,  I",1
"When people ask for advice, typically 90% of them ask for multiple answers. Multiple answers is better than just one piece of advice. Because one piece of advice Is not enough to wrap your mind around it may be good advice but It just doesn't sink in. If you get multiple pieces of advice It sinks into your mind better because you have multiple things to think about instead of just one. Multiple pieces of advice is the best because It gives you more options, It gives you better options, and It just penetrates into your mind better.

First, multiple pieces of advice Is just out of the park better because It gives you more options. It gives you more opinions, because lets say you went to your uncle and he said something about what you should do, then you went to your dad and he said something different on what you should do. You have to different opinions on what you should do. Those two different opinions could be worded differently but they could mean the same thing. You could just like one more than the other because of how It's worded differently. That's why It's good to have multiple opinions because you might like one more.

Then, It gives you better options. Lets say you went out with your friends and you told them to give you ideas on how to ask the girl you like out. You asked one of your friends and he said something incredibly unwise, then you asked your other friends and they said something the complete opposite and It was a good idea. You went with the better option because you don't want to mess It up and not be able to date her. That's why It's important to have multiple answers because you want to have the best option possible.

Lastly, you want to have the best option sunken into your head. When an option Is stuck in your head you are less likely to forget It. Here's and example say you played the same song over and over for one week, even though you didn't listen to that song for another two weeks you will still most likely remember it because you listened to it over and over. Now that song is stuck in your head and you wont forget It. That's why It's good to get things stuck In your head so you dont forget them.

Typically 90% of people ask for multiple options of advice. This Is the best because you have more options, you get better options, and It penetrates into your head. Because of these the best option Is to ask for multiple pieces of advice because you don't want to end up forgetting anything or messing up.",0
"Pet Daycares:

Pet daycares are facilities that offer a variety of services for pets, including grooming, boarding, and daycare. These facilities are designed to provide a safe and comfortable environment for pets while their owners are away. Pet daycares typically offer a range of activities for pets, such as playtime, exercise, and socialization. In addition to these services, many pet daycares also offer specialized care for pets with specific needs, such as dogs with separation anxiety or senior pets.

When choosing a pet daycare, it is important to research the facility's qualifications and experience. Look for a facility that has certified and trained staff, and that follows industry best practices for pet care. It is also important to consider the facility's location and availability, as well as their pricing and services.

Types of Fish and their Necessary Habitat Requirements:

Fish are a popular pet for many people, but they require a specific habitat to thrive. Different types of fish have different requirements for their environment, including water temperature, pH level, and tank size. Some fish, such as tropical fish, require warm water and a well-maintained aquarium with a variety of decorations and hiding places. Other fish, such as cold water fish, require a cooler environment with a well-filtered tank.

In addition to these basic requirements, it is important to provide fish with a balanced diet and regular maintenance. This includes feeding them a high-quality diet, monitoring their water chemistry, and performing regular water changes. By providing the right habitat and care, fish can live healthy and happy lives as pets.

Impact of Temperature Changes on Plants:

Temperature changes can have a significant impact on plants, both indoors and outdoors. Plants require a specific temperature range to grow and thrive, and even small changes in temperature can cause stress or damage. For example, plants that are kept in a room with a draft or near a heating vent may experience temperature fluctuations that can harm them.

To ensure that plants are correctly taken care of, it is important to monitor their temperature and provide them with the right amount of light and water. This includes placing them in a location with the appropriate amount of sunlight, watering them regularly, and providing them with proper drainage. By providing the right care, plants",1
"We all plan to get cars when we get our licenses right? Wrong! The relationship between people and cars throughout the Earth is changing with fewer people buying cars and governments supporting the use of more eco-friendly methods of transportation. Two advantages of this change that I would like to point out is first the improvement in health, and second the fact green house gasses have gone down. These may seem like great ideas, but you may be asking yourself are such advantages possible?

Begining with the lack of pollution, cars can produce Carbon dioxide which causes problems in the atmosphere. The gas traps sunlight creating greenhouse gasses which is responsible for global warming. This would cause problems for future generations with an increase in flooding and other factors that can destroy areas of living, not to mention the fact breathing in the fumes is bad for health. The scary part about the relationship between green house gasses and cars is that twelve percent of green house gasses caused by cars are in Europe. This may no frighten you, but when you take into account fifty percent of green house gasses lie in the U.S., you realize how seroius and frightenning the situation really is.

Another benefit of the lack of car usage is the improvement of public health. It's known by many scientist and psycohlogist that an increase in stress is bad for health and can lower a person's life expentancy. In Vaubun Germany a mother's words about their Vaubun progam was ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" meanwhile in Bogota, Columbia a bussiness man said ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" during Bogota's car-free day program. Aside from the stress, people are getting far more fit as they walk or take a bike to their destionations, even in large cities like New York where you'll see people joining bike programs. Bicycle lanes are increasing greatley and in Bogota, 118 miles have already been built.

In conclusion, I would like to point out that out our world is improving. The awareness of government and the people has lead into the creation of bicycle lanes, a lowering in the stress level of the people, and a decrease in green house gasses. This will in turn provide a better future for countless generations of people throughout the entire planet. It's as Bill Ford, executive of the Ford Motor company stated ""pedestria, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""

"Can you imagine taking many oversea trips taking care of animals?! That is just what the participants in the amazing program of Seagoing Cowboys do. Three reasons for joining the Seagoing Cowboys are that the Seagoing Cowboys help people affected by wars, the Seagoing Cowboys get to see many amazing places, and the Seagoing Cowboys have much fun on their journeys.

Most importantly, the Seagoing Cowboys save lives. The ""Cowboys"" take trips with many animals, and all of the supplies to take care of these animals. When the animals arrive at their destination, they are given away to hungry families. The text reads, ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys""to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

Equally important,Seagoing Cowboys got to see amazing places on their journeys. The Cowboys travel all over the world and went sightseeing evrywhere they went. When they went to Greece, they saw the Parthenon and a excavated castle in Crete. They got to see many differnt sight in China. The text states, ""' So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.'""

Lastly, the Seagoing Cowboys had a ton of fun on their boat rides, despite the fact that they had to take care of animals. They played volley ball in emty stalls. They also had table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. The text reads, "" Luke also found time fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.""

In conclusion, you should become a Seagoing Cowboy because you help others, get to see amazing places, and get to have tons of fun on the journeys. It sounds like tons of fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy!   ",0
"The Tortoise and the Rabbit: A Story of Determination and Hard Work

The story of the tortoise and the rabbit is one of the most well-known fables in the world. It tells the tale of a slow-moving tortoise who challenges a fast-paced rabbit to a race. The rabbit, confident in his speed, quickly gets ahead of the tortoise and decides to take a nap midway through the race, thinking that he had plenty of time to catch up. However, when the rabbit wakes up, he finds that the tortoise has crawled steadily and determinedly towards the finish line, winning the race.

This story can be applied to the idea of accomplishing more if we are always doing something. The rabbit's mistake was not taking action consistently and relying on his speed to win the race. On the other hand, the tortoise's determination and hard work paid off in the end. By working consistently towards his goal, the tortoise was able to overcome the rabbit's initial lead and ultimately win the race.

Failure can be avoided by having a strong determination and working hard to succeed. In the story of the tortoise and the rabbit, the rabbit's failure was not due to a lack of effort, but rather to a lack of consistency and determination. By working hard and consistently towards our goals, we can avoid failure and increase our chances of success.

Let's compare two students, one working on the task from the start of the summer vacation, and the other one relaxing and not taking action until the end. The student who worked on the task from the start of the summer vacation likely had a clear goal in mind and worked consistently towards achieving it. This student likely did research, created an outline, and wrote drafts until they were satisfied with their final product. On the other hand, the student who relaxed and did not take action until the end likely did not have a clear goal in mind and did not put in the necessary effort to achieve their desired outcome. This student may have struggled to complete the task on time or may have produced a subpar product.

Time is an important factor in achieving our goals. We must make it effective by doing something. In the story of the tortoise and the rabbit, the tortoise's determination and hard work paid off because he was consistent in",1
"Schools are known to be one of the struggles that all student go through. Because many students struggle with school, online classes and studying from home became an option. However, attending classes in school is more beneficial than taking classes at home, because students focus more in classes at school than at home, and because school is a place where students meet new people and make friendships.

Although some might argue that schools make students stressed, however, schools provide entertaining trips for students, as mentioned before, schools is a place where students make friendships. A

trip with friends helps to overcome stress. Not to add, schools also offer lots of programs and counseling to help out stressed students to overcome their stress.

Taking classes at school helps students be more focused on the lesson that is being discussed in class. For example, when taking classes at home student will have the freedom to do other things while the lesson is being explained, such as using cell phones or talking to people in the same room. This leads to; students not having the full attention and focus on the lesson. This makes students not fully understanding of the lesson and causing them to get bad grades. Since all the attention will be on the lesson at classes in school, students will be focused and will have better grades. Additionally, taking classes at school also gives students the opportunity to ask questions in case of not understanding something, which online classes don't always provide for students.

School is the place where students make friendships and have fun. For instance, when taking classes at home, students will miss the chance to go school dances and make memories. Also, schools help with meeting new people, learning whats wrong and whats right by going through some trouble. This helps students figure out who they are, and who they want to be. When taking classes at home, it will lower the chance for students to meet new people and to figure out who they want to be. That is why classes at school are more helpful.

As can be seen, taking classes at school is more efficient way, than taking classes at home. Even though schools might be stressful, it helps student be more focus on lessons being explained which leads to better grades. And it also helps students to make friendships, have fun, and have memories. That is why taking classes at school should be more supported.",0
"It would seem to most people that the idea of doing your schooling in the comfort of your own home would be fantastic, but it may not be as easy and productive as it seems. There is some positive aspects to this idea it just seems to be out weighed by the cons of distance learning. There are a lot of possible troubles and inconveniences that could come from this program. For example, distractions, cheating and communication issues could make this distance learning very difficult. If they went through with these distance learning and online classes then, there would be a lot of issues and problems that could be detrimental to the education of the students.

A big issue that comes with distance learning on online classes is distractions. Environment plays a big role in the learning place a healthy learning environment can make a worlds difference. Being in your own home can surround you with distractions and will effect the amount the student participates. Distractions like video games, pets, cell phones, and even food. All of these are monitored in a class room and can be controlled.

Also, cheating could be accessed very easily though online assignments. This is similar to my point on distractions because in school cheating can be monitored so much easier. There are some precautions and restrictions to make it difficult for the students to cheat but through the computer they can not fully put a stop to it. If the students are cheating and there is not anything stopping them they are not gaining any knowledge or benefiting from the course or subject but they will still be receiving credits for the class. Some schools implement web browser blocks so you can not research any information during an assignment and require you to have a web cam so they can watch you but there are to many faults in these systems that the online class gets taken advantage of.

Lastly, communication would be made extremely difficult through online learning. The teacher and student interaction would be poor. This would have a negative effect on the students progress and success in the class. People learn in so many different ways and rates that one teacher or a non responsive program would not be able to effectively teach a large class. Students would be left confused and unprepared if they did not understand a certain part of a lesson. The teacher would not be available to go in detail and a program could not provide more helpful information. The lack of interaction that you have in person or in a classroom would have a negative effect of the knowledge absorbed and the performance.

However, in some cases the distance learning from the home can be beneficial. For example, people in remote locations who cannot access public schooling could use this and people who struggle with anxiety could enroll and get an education through this program. This would be beneficial for people in situations like these listed.

Although, there are few cases where the online classes could trump classroom learning there is still too many cons out weighing the benefits from the program.

To be more specific, the distance learning and online schooling programs have too many flaws to be heavily depended on especially as your main source of education. Eventually, this could be a very successful thing for students all over, but until there is some refining it is not beneficial to the students. It is not worth it to be able to do your school from home if you are not getting the most out of it.         ",0
"Churchill consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, he said that because he wants to animate people to not be shy of anything and I'm agre with that.

Some say Churchill go from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm because sometimes people feel shy when they are doing somehing that they don't want to do, like me. I'm so shy when I have to do presentations, I don't feel confortable. But we have to get out our fears, that are killing us to not do what we have to do. People sometimes said that they going somewhere but they said that they don't want to go alone because he/she feels weird, like if you are new in this country, they tell maybe to their cousins to go with him/her.

People should be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because that makes you feel successed and that makes you to be a good person. Actually, Churchill said that because he want to people to not loose their enthusiasm in something that they want and that is a good choose.

People should not be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because I think people don't want to do want Churchill said in the statement and they are not going to follow the statement . Actually, people is not agree because people think that is not importat statement for them and thats why people are not agree with the statement.

"As an 8th grader, it's inevitable that we will face difficult times in our lives. Whether it's a breakup, a family issue, or a problem at school, it's important to know how to effectively seek advice and comfort when we need it. In this essay, I will research and compile the different ways to effectively seek advice and comfort when going through a difficult time.

One way to seek advice and comfort is to talk to a trusted friend or family member. They can provide a different perspective and help you see things from a different angle. Additionally, they can offer emotional support and a listening ear. However, it's important to choose the right person to talk to, as not everyone may be able to offer the support and advice you need.

Another way to seek advice and comfort is to seek professional help. This could be in the form of a counselor or therapist. They can provide a safe and confidential space to talk about your feelings and offer guidance on how to navigate through difficult times. They can also provide coping strategies and tools to help you manage your emotions and improve your mental health.

In addition to talking to friends and family or seeking professional help, it's also important to engage in self-care activities. This could include things like exercise, meditation, or journaling. These activities can help reduce stress and improve your overall well-being. It's also important to take time for yourself and do things that bring you joy and happiness.

Finally, it's important to remember that seeking advice and comfort is a sign of strength, not weakness. It's okay to ask for help and support when you need it. By doing so, you can navigate through difficult times with the support and guidance you need to come out stronger on the other side.

In conclusion, seeking advice and comfort is an important part of navigating through difficult times. Whether it's talking to a trusted friend or family member, seeking professional help, engaging in self-care activities, or simply taking time for yourself, there are many ways to effectively seek advice and comfort. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, and with the right support and guidance, you can come out stronger on the other side.",1
"During the story the author explains why it is dnagerous to try and explore Venus. The author tells us that Venus it like our twin sister (Earth) by saying the we are almost simliar in nearly everthing, like density and size and that we are closer in distance to this planet. Then the author names our planetary neighbors, (Earth,Venus, and Mars) and how they orbit the sun diferently. The differences mean the we could closer to Mars one day and closer to Venus the next day. There are many dangers on Venus including that their thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers the planet of Venus. Also the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in their atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and o top of all that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what happens on planet Earth. The conditions on Venus are to extreme for humans to enconter. Venus is so dangerous that a submarine could be crushed in minutes. Even though Venus is not the closest planet to the Sun it is extremely hot and it even has the hottest temperatures on a planet then any other planet in our solar system. On Venus it could have erupting volcanos,powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning strikes. We have tried to land a non human space shuttle on Venus but it tends to be damage or destoryed before even landing on the planet thats why Venus is really dangerous. ",0
"Sure, here is an essay responding to the prompt as if it were written by an average 8th grade student:

As I grow older, I realize that making choices is a big part of life. Whether it's what to wear to school or what career to pursue, the choices we make can have a big impact on our future. But sometimes, making choices can be hard. I mean, how do you know if you're making the right decision? That's why I think it's important to research how to make and define your own character.

First, you need to think about what you want to be when you grow up. Do you want to be a doctor or a teacher? A scientist or an artist? Once you know what you want to be, you can start thinking about how to get there. What steps do you need to take? What kind of education do you need? What skills do you need to develop?

But it's not just about you. Other people might have opinions about the choices you make. They might think you're making the wrong decision or that you're not good enough. That can be hard to deal with, but it's important to remember that you are in control of your own life. You get to make the choices, and you have to live with the consequences.

So, how do you become what you dreamed of being? Well, first you have to set goals for yourself. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to be known for? Then, you have to work hard to reach those goals. You might face obstacles along the way, but you can't give up. You have to keep going and keep trying until you reach your dreams.

Researching how to make and define your own character is important because it can help you make better choices. It can help you figure out what you want to be and how to get there. It can also help you deal with the opinions of others and stay focused on your goals.

In conclusion, making choices is a big part of life, and it's important to research how to make and define your own character. By thinking about what you want to be and how to get there, you can make better choices and reach your goals. Don't let the opinions of others stop you from pursuing your dreams. Keep",1
"When you think about a presidential election you think about getting the chance to make a difference in the country and make a big descison that may affect your life as well as everyone in the country. The electoral college should be abolish and mad to where the elections are fair. It should be change because it doesn't allow people to vote for the candidate that is running for president. The electoral college not only allows people to take away a popluar votebut they can also give to whomever they choose to give it to. But it can cause a very big problem just like it did in 1960 when the segregationist tried to get new electors who would oppose Jonh F. Kennedy.

Because of the winner take all system these candidates don't even go and vist some states beacuse they know they wouldn't have a chance of winning. This can also lead to some states not having the chance to ever see or meet the candidate just like in 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't have a chance of seeing the candidates at all. If you wanted to vote for a candidate you wouldn't have a chance to vote because you would have to vote for electors pledged to that candidate. Most of everyone in the counrty would have to vote whomever the electors are who are pledged to that canddidate which isn't fair. So the electoral college should be changed to where everyone can vote for any candidate they want because it's not only fair but rational and agreeable.        ",0
"I am not agree because everybody in this world can be freedom to think or to do whetever they wan because we have the independence of right. They can enthusiasm for things or wons that they did.

If they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that it's. That if they don't want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me.

you never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and don't be failure and don't play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.

I will give you one example for this thing, you see the poor people that they follow the rules just for money or do whetever things just for money is because they just wanna a good future for they kid's and they don't wanna failure they just fight for they kid's to have a good education and they hope that one they they can be somebody profetional like doctor and help them family to get out the situation of poor.

I hope that everyone in this world can see the right things and complete and don't be afraid if you don't do nothing bad why you suppost to be afraid you have your right laws. If you play wiht that thing you can fail in your life, but you can learn that way because when you broken down and you say i can't continue with this, is when you have to say i am stronger, the life give a leason, and i learn about that. Now i see and i can be better.

You can see now that you can do it. When you wish something like be profetional, soccer player, but if you play with failure you can fail thats right you can not have to play wiht that.

Also there is going to be peoples in your way that they dosen't want that you can be happy, like a fake friends, and sometimes we were really surprised because someones in your family are fake too, but don't pay atention to them just focus in your dreams and finish.

Another example is my self because when i came in United States, i don't even know English and i thoght that will be more difficul for me, i thoght that i will fail every class, but is not how was i thihk because i just focus in my class and i work hard every single day, and i never fail one class that's right you never have to loss the enthusiasm in your life and enjoy every single day, because the life is just one and we has to make the most of opportunitys in this life, and be happy every single day.

When i came in United States without my parents i thoght that will be more difficul for me, at the beginnig was so hard because i always live with them but i never give up because i know that they want a good future for me and i saw that way and now i juts want to help them because they are a good example in my life they say to me, son just fight for your dreams and don't worry about us you know that will be ok and that's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i want to reversed the help that they give me one day.

My father and my mother say, you arer the reason for work and fight so hard for you. You will have a good future don't be afriad don't loss your enthusiasm. That's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i take the example that they give me because i wanna be a good example for my childrens and be like my parents or better.

When you have a problems to solve and you feel that you can fail just think creatively about different ways to solve and actively work to balance your mind, health and emotions or enthusiasm. we have to develop many ways to solve the problems. Our environment it will be consider many perspectives, and how we can work to balance our mind, health and see many solutions in our life.",0
"Thousands of people around the world use cars. It's an allaround good mode of transportation. Unfortunately, the fumes that cars emit are harmful for the environment. There are ways to limit car usage. Limiting car usage has many benefits such us the decrease in greenhouse house gas, the decrease in smog, and resources are conserved.

First off, reducing the usage of cars can cut the amount of greenhouse gas produced dramatically. One can easily cut down on car usage by using other means of transportation such as : riding bike, riding the train, and plain walking. Greenhouse gas emissions are very harmful and are mostly caused by car emissions. Around fifty percent of passenger cars are responsible for these gasses source 1. If we limit car usage we can promote a healthier environment.

Additionally, reducing car usage also cuts down smog. Smog is another deadly gas that isnt just dangerous to the environment, but also to us. Smog is polluted air which can cause sickness. Many cities around the world are increasing in smog due to the overusage of cars. For example Paris almost broke the record for polluted air, which is held by China, one of the most polluted cities in the world source 2. If we reduce the usage of cars, we promote cleaner air for ourselves. Just by limiting the car usage for five days in Paris, the smog went down sixty percent source 2. The advantage of limiting car usage would be cleaner air.

Finally, limiting car usage is beneficial because it conserves resources. If we dont rely on cars, we could make cities more compact source 1. Therefore reducing the amount of land destroyed to build malls, highways, and houses. This would save tons of resources that were going to be used on building and natural resources source 4. Limiting car usage would improve life all around.

All in all, the limit on car usage would benefit the environment, it would benefit our health, and it would aid the conservation of resources.",0
"When a student chooses to attend classes from home, they can reap a variety of benefits. These benefits can range from more leisure time, the opportunity to sleep longer, and the elimination of a daily commute. For example, consider a student who is attending classes from home due to the current pandemic. By staying home, they are able to sleep in longer and eliminate the need to take a bus or walk to and from school. With more time to sleep, a student can stay healthier with sufficient rest, and more time for exercise and healthy meals. Additionally, with the distractions of school removed, the student has an improved focus and can better plan their time. Of course, there are some drawbacks to attending classes from home, like the potential for distractions from family and friends as well as feelings of isolation from classmates. But with the right balance, a student can make the most of online classes and find success.",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe allowing students to bring their phones to school will cause distractions and result in grade point averages dropping. I feel this way because I know from personal experience when a phone goes off in class everyone stops to talk. School is meant to be for learning not socializing with our peers! I also think others will take advantage of the privilege you want to give us. From the past I have seen many students easily text one another the answers and cheat, without the teacher noticing. Many times I have even seen them on Face-book! I know we are all teenagers and just want to be with our friends, however I don't think you should encourage or allow us to bring our phones.

To tell you the truth, I would love to have my phone at school but I feel I wouldn't be able to focus. Checking my phone for a new text message every second and listen to TEACHER_NAME, as he talks about the Holocaust is not an easy task to do. Many students would not know when to turn things in or even then the next test is.

Another point I need to make is that just one text message or picture can ruin someone's reputation. Rumors are always started at school, and I don't think they should be carried on while we are at school. This will just create for work for you in the end. For example, more consolers and punishment will be required. Who said and sent what is not a fun game to pay! Before you know your school will be a jungle!

So why encourage it? For safety? My suggestion is if you put a phone is every teaches room, all the students will have access to it and not need their own phone. If they forgot their lunch just a quick phone call is all that is needed. Thank you for all you time.

Respectfully,

"Hey Earth has a twin. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author strongly suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Although the author's idea may sound wild to some he does support his argument very intelligently.

To begin the author supports his ideas by giving back ground knowledge on Venus. The author then preoceeds to scientificly explain the orbits that Venus, Mars and Earth under takes.""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the cornerin space termshumans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world."" The explanation that the author gives us shows us the simalirty of the planets and the efforts of exploring Venus is important despite its conditons.

In paragraph 4 the author uses a rhetorcle device ""If our sister planet is so inhostible, why are scientist even discuusign further vistits to its surface. The author uses a rhetoricle quetsion to get his point across to the reader. The author goes further into depth by describing the geogrphics of Venus and how it could of been a Earth like planet long ago."" Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.""

The author brings in NASA into the conversation and explains to us how they have been working to explore Venus. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" Although the author is fully aware of the extreme condtions of Venus they still don't believe that hoviering 30 miles from Venus wont provide them with enough information. The author also argues that scientist wont have the ability to take samples of rocks,gas,etc. The author even goes further by saying"" Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to undestand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"".

Well Earth may have a twin, but they are not identical. Despite the harsh conditions of Venus the aurthor does a great job with supporting their idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. Not to forget the author supported their claim with lots of evidence provied through out the text.",0
"Thomas Wright once said, ""To live is not simply to breathe; it is to know life and all of its components."" One of those components is always education, which is a weapon in society. Without it, an individual could be justifiably categorized as defenseless. To take away a person's education would be dangerous and possibly detrimental to his or her success in life. American classrooms are designed to offer students a suitable education for general success, but they do not accommodate the obvious individuality among students. Due to the variety of students' lives, not every child is able to be present in the classroom every single day. Although in-person learning is more effective, because the medical issues and travel commitments of students are inevitable, students would benefit significantly from having the opportunity to attend classes from home.

Every person has known sickness and has not been fond of it, but the overall dislike of the common cold does not stop its occurrences. It is not a celebrity or criminal the world can shame into termination; it is a part of life each individual unfortunately must endure. Kids are known to become ill more often than adults, so it would make sense for schools to offer plans for these situations like distance learning. I have a classmate named Generic_Name who contracted a serious strand of the flu. Generic_Name was forced to miss over a week of class, which put her behind in every course. Now she's struggling to make up work while still learning new objectives; it is quite stressful. This is beyond her control and although her teachers are understanding, there is only so much they can do. If Generic_Name would have had the opportunity to take her classes at home, she would not be too far behind. Because this option is not offered, her week of struggle has bled into the rest of the grading period. Some people may argue that people do not want to do work while they are sick, but this does not apply to every student. Students should at least have the option to be on top of their work, which distance learning provides.

When thinking of luxurious places to be, school is generally one of the last destinations that come to mind. That is not to say that no person considers school his or her top priority because some people do. However, it is more common to state that many students consider an alternate commitment as their superior priority. There are numerous student athletes who value sports as if they are gold. Many students like my friend, Generic_Name, play sports outside of school that require them to travel very often. Generic_Name plays volleyball and has tournaments almost every weekend in places like Generic_City and Generic_City. Some of these trips require her to miss multiple days of school in order to attend them. Even though Generic_Name is very intelligent, she has poor grades because her passion requires her to miss class. This is not a true display of her academic abilities, yet she is penalized. If Generic_Name were able to have videos of each lecture and take online tests while on trips, her grades could be much higher. Some people might say it is her choice to participate in her sport, and she should be held responsible for those decisions. She does not choose to miss school on purpose; it is a result of what she loves to do. School is not the focus of every person's life; it varies among each individual. In America, freedom is advertised in every crevice of the country. Thus, students should be free to pursue what they love while still receiving an education.

Predicaments arise when a person least expects them; they tend to be nonnegotiable, uncontrollable situations that students can not help. A few years ago, I had to travel to three funerals in one school year. This did not just cause me to miss many days of class; upon returning to school, I had to learn in an environment where I could not live up to my full potential due to my emotional strain. At home I would have been more comfortable because I could openly grieve without disturbing a classmate. Even though it seems logical to allow me to stay at home, I was forced to go to school in order to avoid falling behind. I did not fall behind, but I was not able to execute assignments to the best of my ability whereas at home I could have. With access to online assignments my scores on each task would have been improved because I would have been in the comfort of my home. Some people might argue that since I would still be grieving, my grades would have been no different. This is not true; the pressure of a public environment is not equivalent to being in a familiar, safe environment like an individual's room. Feelings of safety often affect student performance; some people are more comfortable at home. Therefore, the option of virtual learning should be offered to maximize the success of each student.

Being physically present in the classroom can make a noticeable difference in a student's success; that is proven. Although this is true, life is unpredictable. No one plans on becoming ill or having numerous family commitments arise, but those situations do occur. School does not possess the highest importance for each individual; it could be athletics, wellness, or even family. Each student lives a different life, which a school system can not control. School is important, but students must be able to live outside of it. Education is not the only component of life. ",0
" I believe that students should have the freedom to choose their own electives rather than being forced to take a class in the arts. While it is important for students to have exposure to the arts, assigning them to a class they know nothing about sets them up for failure. This is especially true in the school district, where it is important to have something to look forward to when students arrive at school.

It is important to give students the opportunity to decide what they believe in and have no doubt about it. By allowing students to choose their own electives, they will be more motivated and engaged in their learning. This will ultimately lead to better grades and a more positive attitude towards school.

Furthermore, if students are not interested in the class they are assigned to, they may not attend. This not only affects their learning but also the overall success of the class. By encouraging students to choose the right fit class, we can ensure that they are engaged and motivated to learn.

In conclusion, giving students the opportunity to choose their own electives will increase their satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future. By allowing students to make decisions that could impact their future goals, we can help them become positive and successful individuals.",1
"Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree with this rule? Yes I do, you see, there are a lot of things you can do as a extracurricular activity maybe you can join your schools sports teams like Baseball, Soccer, Football, or even Track and Field. The point I'm getting at is there are a lot of opportunities you can have with extracurricular activities. Don't like sports or dont want to move around to much?

Don't worry, there are plenty of other things you can do. Maybe you like photography you can join the Yearbook club or the Earths Wonders club. Want to help the environment and help clean up trash on the streets and roads? you can join the Better Tomorrow club. Dont worry though there are a lot more things you can do like maybe you are a creative person and like to paint, sketch, or draw. You may like the Art club full of great artists.

There is also a lot of musical opportunities such as Choir, and Band. In Choir you will be able to sing to your hearts content, go on trips, and sing in concerts. Maybe you dont like to sing you may like band. Band is a purely instrumental group composed of Brass, Percussion, Woodwind, and even Strings. If you like to make music, those are your best choices.

Don't like music and instead like to read. Our Book club might interest you. Just come on down to the library after school and talk about books you like to read. Thats not all though, there are also clubs for TV watchers as well. There is a anime club that talks all things Anime, and a Netflix club as well. If you like watching TV come on down to the Netflix club or Anime club.

If none of that sounds enjoyable or maybe cooking is your calling, our school holds a Culinary Arts club to help students learn and master the art of cooking.

lastly, there is the Teachers For Tomorrow, a group of students willing to teach the next generation of students. We also hold a Ethical Hacking and Computer skills class for those who like technology. There are so many clubs you can join and enjoy at read mountain, for information please ask one of our secretaries in the front office and they will give you a information slip of all the clubs and there meeting places. The club director will give you there specific club meetings. ",0
"In the year 2018 technology is advancing as well as schools all around the world. Most kids roll their eyes or yawn or even have a bored/tired look on their face when they're in a classroom that hey dont enjoy. With new technology called FACS(Facial Action Coding System), it will be able to detect when kids are feeling this way.

The computer makes a 3-D model face of a human and have all 44 major musles that operates like human musles, then it scans the face of a real human which will then identify what the person is feeling right now such as happy, sad, tired, scared and many more. Using this type of technology will be very helpful in classrooms because when a student is feeling bored or tired then the computer will be able to detect that the the teacher will be able to make the topic more interesting for the students. Most teachers have about 28 students per class for seven periods everyday which can be very stressful, so it can be very challenging for them to recognize when students are dealing with a certain type of emotion but with the FACS it can recognize that and the teacher will be able to help the student or students.

In conclusion, FACS is an amazing creation that will be able to help students and teachers. Kids learn the most when they're happy and when the subject they're learning is fun and very interesting and when they're in a good environment. With FACS, it not only detects a humans emotion but it will be able to communicate with a teacher to notify them when a kid is not doing well.           ",0
"Dear Principal,

I have read your policies you are considering on the usage of cell phones in school, and I think that your second policy, the one allowing cell phones in school and ability to use in only free time, is the best idea.

Yes, I am one who may over-use a cell phone, but that's not the reason I think allowing the use of cell phones is important. There are reasons that the ability to get to a mobile device, such as a cell phone, is important. There can be emergency cases in which a student may not be able to access any other phone, or another person, so the cell phone is easily an accessible option if we, the students, have one with us. If there were one of these emergencies and we didn't have a phone to use, there may not be a way we can get help, endangering ourselves, and possibly others.

Other reasons to have a cell phone on your person can also be very important. There may be a time where we need something from home, but what we need isn't information we would be fond of sharing with others. The cell phones would allow students to call home without being in an office with more than him or herself in the room and when calling your parents for the things you need, it might be stressed a little, if you don't want others around you to know.

These are only a couple of good reasons for you to allow cellular devices in school, and I hope that these few reasons will stress the fact that having a cell phone is a good idea. I strongly suggest you allow them in school for the reasons stated above and others also.

Thank you,

"I think that meditation and mindfulness practices are super cool and should totes be included in schools. First of all, it helps us chill out and not be so stressed out. Like, have you ever had a test and you're like freaking out and you can't focus? Yeah, meditation can help with that. It's like, you close your eyes and breathe and you can feel your brain getting calm. It's weird but it works!

Another thing is that it helps us pay attention better. Like, when you're in class and the teacher is talking and you're like daydreaming about puppies or something, you're not really paying attention. But if you do meditation, it can help you focus and listen better. It's like, you're brain is a muscle and meditation is like exercising it.

Plus, it's just nice to have a break in the day. Like, school can be really hard and stressful sometimes and it's nice to have a moment to just chill. It's like, a little present for your brain.

I know some people might think that it's weird or that it's a waste of time, but I think it's really helpful. And it's not just for kids, adults can benefit from it too! My mom does meditation and she says it helps her feel more calm and centered.

So, that's why I think meditation and mindfulness practices should be included in schools. It's like, it's good for our brains and it's good for our happiness. And who doesn't want to be happy? 😊",1
"Vroom! Beep! They everywhere. Cars. People use them everyday to get back and forth to work, school, and other places needed. You may think you need them in everyday life , but their are advantages to limiting car usage in a town.

One advantage to limit car usage is that its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Cars release gasses and toxins with odors into the air that we breath. No one really wants to breath in toxins and bad air that can possibly cause heath problems .

Riding a bike can reduce air pollution . It also can take away stress and help with weight loss or burning calories if you are trying to stay healthy and fit.

Another advantage is not having to pay gas and worrying about gas prices. Money for paying for gas canadd up ove time. That money can be used towards something else important such as bills . Gas also goes back to the pollution problem. Not driving a car and having to pay for gas can reduce that problem.

And last, Limiting driving can limit traffic . No one likes to sit in traffics for hours after a long day at work or at school.    ",0
"People have the opportunity to make life changing decisions everyday.

For example, choosing what college you are going to attend affects your future.

It is important that when making these life changing decisions you evaluate all your options.

No one should rush into a decision without making sure that they make a positive choice.

Making mistakes is important because it allows you to learn and discover new interests.

However, you do not want to make a mistake when you are making a decision that will affect you for the rest of your life.

During such important events talking to the people you trust helps you make a decision that is right for you.

Having multiple options is a very important thing to have when you are making a big decision.

It allows you to evaluate your choices, and it helps you discover all other possible outcomes before making a final decision.

By talking to multiple people you are able to learn about all possible scenarios that could occur from your choice.

Eventually after thinking about all the information you learn from talking to other people you can decide which opinion you agree with most.

Listening to what other people would do in a situation helps you discover more about your beliefs.

Discovering your beliefs also helps you clearly see what the right thing to do is.

Finally, after talking to multiple people your final decision is usually within reach.

Dealing with issues in a positive way is an important skill that everyone should have.

Taking advice can sometimes be a challenge, however, it can also help you make sure that you are kind when dealing with serious issues.

Talking to family members that you trust allows you to take the best advice that will help you with your problem.

This allows you to listen to the opinions of multiple people which will help you decide which choice relates to you the most.

Making healthy choices is very important, and listening to others gives you the ability to do that.

Another reason that it is important to talk to others when making a big decision is because it prevents you from making a mistake.

When facing big decisions you do not want to make a mistake that you will regret later on.

Reaching out to multiple people and listening to their opinions can help you discover when you are about to make a mistake.

This method of problem solving can also help you learn from your mistakes before you make them.

Which is why listening to others is an important thing to do throughout your life.

Asking other people for advice is something that everyone has to do at some point during their life.

Talking to multiple people is a method that allows positive outcomes from these conversations.

Even if you don't take advice from one of the people that you talk to, it is still important to listen to what they have to say.

This is because sometimes just listening to other people can allow you to discover what you think is right.

You do not always have to agree with the opinions of others, however, their stories have the ability to teach you valuable life lessons.

Remembering these stories is important because it allows you to not make the same mistakes.

Instead, you can make your own mistakes and decisions throughout your life.

These decisions, are stories that you wil tell later in life to other people, to help them make important decisions as well.  ",0
"You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. One of the reasons is that you get to see amazing historical places that you otherwise wouldn't get to see. I loved that you got to take care of the animals. You also should know of the dangers of being a Seagoing Cowboy. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

As a Seagoing Cowboy I got to travel and see many different places. I got to see Europe and China. I even got to see the Acropolis in Greece! I also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I even got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and I had the oppurtunity to marvel the Panama Canal on my way to China. The sights were amazing!

I loved caring for the animals. It kept me busy during the crossings. They all had to be fed and watered three times a day. My job also required me to drag the bales of hay and the bags of oats up from the lower holds. I also had to clean the stalls, which isn't as bad as it sounds. I loved taking care of the animals.

You must beware though of what the dangers are of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I was making my hourly report to the captain when I slid down a slippery ladder. My heart began to race as I looked down and saw the dark blue sea. I was only saved by a small strip of metal. I would have flown overboard! I mean what would you expect when you are out at see.

You shoud become a Seagoing Cowboy. There may be dangers, but there is also great fun. You could go to places you have always wanted to go and see things you have always wanted to see. You would probably also love forming a bond and taking care of the animals. It is an amazing way to help people to recover after this terrible tragedy that destroyed everything they owned. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. ",0
"Some people may view car limitations as bad or inconvenient, but that isn't true. There are plenty or ways to get to where you want to go other than driving. More people have been cutting down on their car usage and it helps with many things. There are lots of advantages to communities and cities when car usage is limited.

Pollution is a major problem in big cities like Bejing, China known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Cutting down car usage in big cities like this can help get rid of the horrendous smog. Paris, which often has more smog than other European capitals, has made some significant changes to help reduce the smog and harmful greenhouse gasses that are trapped in the air from car emissions. They let cars with even numbered license plates drive on some days and cars with odd numbered license plates drive on others. This reduced the smog in Paris within a few days.

Most people depend quite a bit on their cars. Reducing car usage can help people not to be so dependent on their cars. Instead of driving to work people can ride the bus, take the subway, etc. This will help a lot with the congestion of the roads during rush hours. There will be a lot less traffic if people are carpooling or taking some other mode of transportation, keeping roadways clearer for emergency vehicles and public transportation. There also won't be the problem of people being late if they get stuck in traffic or their car breaks down.

The number of miles people in America drive has gone down significantly since 2005. This means that people are finding better, more efficient ways of getting to where they need to be. This will help everyone in the long run. There will be less money spent on cars, car repairs, and gasoline saving everyone a lot of money. Cars can be very expensive to maintain, especially when no one knows if their car battery is going to die or if they will get a flat tire. Having another source of transportation would save people lots of time and money. If there is less need for cars, then more public transportation will be offered, even in places less populated like the suburbs.

Limiting car usage is helpful for everyone and eventually it will become even more efficient and convenient not to drive a car everywhere. Pollution will go down and money will be saved. There are already entire communities like the one in Vauban, Germany that don't rely on cars. If there were more communities like this around the world, they would help lead the way to a new age where cars aren't as important and people won't have to depend on them as much as they do now.",0
"Dear Principal,

There are rumors going around that you might make it mandatory for the students at the school to perform community service hours. I believe that it may be helpful for some students to perform community service because it could keep them out of trouble or serve as their punishment for misbehaving regularly but it could also hinder some students. Some students at the school are well behaved but aren't doing well with their grades. So instead of performing acts for the community they could be studying to improve their grades. With the improvement of grades in the school the students will most likely have less stress on getting their homework finished or working in class and will be more attentive in class.

Another reason not to have community service is that some students have activities outside of school. Sports is a very important activity to some athletic students in the school because that is how some of them are paying for college. If you take that away from them then they might not get a scholarship to the college that they want.

If we do have community service then it should be for students that are doing excellent in schoolwork but not make it mandatory. To make students that are doing well enough in school want to work for the community, there should be a reward for the most hours performed. This way if the students not doing well in all of there classes want to earn the reward they will work harder to do well and get in the race for the prize. The entire school's grade point average will raise if they are willing to work for the prize.

The prize should be something grand and well thought out. It could be a certificate to a restaurant or a few concert tickets. If the entire school does well enough, we should be able to go on a ""fun field trip.""

With these ideas there will possibly be many community service hours performed and grades improved. Please take this letter into thought when you decide on making community service mandatory or not.

Sincerely,

A concerned student.",0
"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advantages such as reducing pollution, increasing safety for human beings, and even opening options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of pollutants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with hepburn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vehicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay 40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined 31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public announcement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleaner. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familiar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vehicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases safety, bumping into another human or being nudged by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.",0
"Phones and Driving

Cell phone have become very popular over the past few years. According to the iPhone the world is going crazy over them. There are about 7.53 billion people in this world and 3.3 billion people have phone. Some people use their phones for good reasons, for example, they may need to use their GPS but 50 percent of the time this is bad because the people would be more force on the directions then the road and 9 times out of 10 this will cause a car wreck! This is not safe at all.

People should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it's a distraction. When using a cell phone in the car you must look down and not up, when operating a car, you must be looking straight ahead and watching for red lights and stop sign. Also, must be watching for other cars when those cars are not paying attention.

Another reason you shouldn't use you phone and drive because you're more likely to found at fault for the accident that you may cause. Insurance rate hike, consider your passengers, consider other motorists, protect the pedestrians. It only takes a few seconds to park your car and use the phone. Its better if people should just use hand-free mode to regrade the racks and insurance.

"Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Much may be done if we are always on it nonstop."" While this quote may seem to suggest that inactivity is detrimental, it is important to evaluate the purpose of inactivity and its benefits. In this essay, I will analyze the potential pitfalls of being inactive, examine whether people can accomplish more if they are working all the time or taking breaks, and argue whether inactivity serves a purpose.

Firstly, it is important to understand that inactivity can serve a purpose. For example, taking a break from work or other activities can help individuals recharge and refocus their energy. This can lead to increased productivity and creativity when they return to their work. Additionally, inactivity can provide a much-needed break from the stress and pressure of daily life. This can help individuals maintain their mental and physical health, which is essential for long-term success.

However, there are also potential pitfalls to being inactive. For example, if individuals spend too much time sitting or engaging in low-activity pursuits, they may become sedentary and experience negative health effects. This can include weight gain, decreased cardiovascular fitness, and an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, inactivity can lead to decreased productivity and creativity, as individuals may struggle to focus and stay motivated.

It is also important to consider whether people can accomplish more if they are working all the time or taking breaks. While it may seem counterintuitive, research has shown that taking breaks can actually lead to increased productivity and creativity. This is because breaks allow individuals to recharge and refocus their energy, which can lead to better performance when they return to their work. On the other hand, working all the time can lead to burnout and decreased productivity. This is because individuals may become overwhelmed and struggle to maintain their focus and motivation.

In conclusion, while inactivity may seem detrimental, it can serve a purpose. It is important to evaluate the potential pitfalls of being inactive and consider whether people can accomplish more if they are working all the time or taking breaks. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to find a balance between work and rest, and to prioritize their mental and physical health. By doing so, they can achieve their goals and live a fulfilling life.",1
"Dear Ms. Smith,

I think Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. I know some people might think that having phones at school is distracting, but I think it's important for us to have them.

First of all, it's important for us to be able to communicate with our parents. What if there's an emergency and we need to call them? Or what if they need to reach us? It's a lot easier if we have our phones. Plus, it's not like we're going to be on them all the time. We'll only use them during lunch and free time, when we're not in class.

Another reason why Policy 1 is better is that it's more realistic. A lot of us have phones already, and it's not like we're going to stop using them just because they're not allowed at school. If we're not allowed to have them, we'll just find ways to sneak them in. And that's not fair to the students who follow the rules.

Also, having phones at school can actually help us learn. We can use them to look up information for projects or to access online resources. And we can also use them to take pictures of whiteboard notes or to record lectures. That way, we can review the material later.

I understand that some people might worry about bullying or distractions, but I think that's not a good reason to ban phones altogether. We should focus on teaching students how to use technology responsibly, rather than just taking it away from them.

I hope you'll consider Policy 1 and allow us to have phones at school. Thank you for listening to my opinion.

Sincerely,

"Working in a group or alone has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people prefer to work alone, others believe that working in a group is more beneficial. In my opinion, working in a group has more benefits than working alone.

One of the most significant benefits of working in a group is time management. When working alone, it can be challenging to manage time effectively. There are no deadlines or accountability, which can lead to procrastination and poor time management. On the other hand, when working in a group, there are deadlines and accountability. This means that group members are more likely to stay on track and manage their time effectively.

Another benefit of working in a group is gaining new information. When working alone, it can be challenging to gain new information. There are no different perspectives or ideas to consider. However, when working in a group, there are different perspectives and ideas to consider. This can lead to a more well-rounded understanding of the topic and a more creative solution to the problem.

Faster work is another benefit of working in a group. When working alone, it can take longer to complete a task. This is because there is no one to bounce ideas off of or to help with the task. However, when working in a group, there are more people to bounce ideas off of and to help with the task. This can lead to faster work and a more efficient solution to the problem.

Finally, working in a group can lead to making new friends. When working alone, it can be challenging to make new friends. There are no opportunities to interact with other people. However, when working in a group, there are opportunities to interact with other people. This can lead to new friendships and a more social environment.

In conclusion, working in a group has more benefits than working alone. Time management, gaining new information, faster work, and making new friends are just a few of the benefits. While some people prefer to work alone, the benefits of working in a group are too great to ignore.",1
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It, when originally pictured, may have looked like some sort of face or alien artifact, but with new high-resolution imaging and 3D altimetry, we can see that this ""Face"" is just a mesa. This type of mesa is commonly found in the region of Mars where the Face is located, called Cydonia. These mesas are also commonly found here on Earth, in the American Southwest. The fact that these types of landforms are commonplace means that the Face is nothing special.

One piece of evidence that supports my claim is the new photos. Back in 1976, when the Face was first pictured, the pixel size on photos of Mars was 43 meters per pixel! That makes for a very blurry picture with not many details. When the Face was photographed in 1998, and again in 2001, the pixel size was much smaller, at 1.56 meters per pixel. This means that objects on the Martian surface bigger than 5 meters would be picked up in detail by the photo. This proves that the new picture shows it all: a common, everyday mesa.

A second piece of evidence that supports my claim is that NASA would not try to hide alien artifacts in their pictures from the public. This is because if NASA found life on Mars through one of their studies, they would become very popular for the fact and would draw a lot of attention. They may have even won a Nobel Prize, so NASA would definitely not hide it. Conspiracy theorists who claim the Face is alien would be completely wrong because of this fact. NASA isn't hiding anything. The Face on Mars is just a mesa.

A third piece of evidence that supports my claim is that NASA was excited about displaying this photo and wanted to learn more just like the public. They wouldn't have given all this trouble to the Face just to lie about it to the general citizens. NASA was probably disappointed when they found out that the Face was a mesa, but they had to tell the truth. Mesas are common around Cydonia, and also common on Earth, so there is no reason for NASA to lie.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a completely false object. This ""Face"" is just a common mesa, found all the time where the Face is and on Earth. NASA did not lie about the Face because they had no reason to. The new, high-resolution imaging says it all. The Face on Mars is a mesa. No doubt about it. Case closed.",0
"I think that raising the minimum wage in our country is a necessary step to take. The current minimum wage is not enough for people to live on, and many workers are struggling to make ends meet.

Firstly, raising the minimum wage would help reduce poverty. Many people who work minimum wage jobs are living in poverty, and they often have to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. This can lead to a lower quality of life, as well as health problems and increased stress. By raising the minimum wage, we can help lift people out of poverty and improve their overall well-being.

Secondly, raising the minimum wage would stimulate the economy. When people have more money to spend, they are more likely to spend it on goods and services. This increased demand can lead to job growth and economic expansion. Additionally, when workers are paid a living wage, they are more motivated and productive, which can benefit both the workers and the companies they work for.

Finally, raising the minimum wage is simply the right thing to do. People who work hard should be able to earn a living wage that allows them to support themselves and their families. It is unfair to expect people to work full-time jobs and still live in poverty.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage in our country is a necessary and important step to take. It would help reduce poverty, stimulate the economy, and ensure that workers are paid a fair wage for their work. We should take action to raise the minimum wage and create a more just and equitable society for all.",1
"I think that driverless cars would be a very positive thing. Thre big reasons for this are that without drivers there would be less aciidents, they would be more efficient wih gas, and there would be no need for insurance. So overall a big improvement on todays society.

Firstly without drivers there would be less accidents. Now since since not everyone would be able to afford using them there will still be accidents butz the number will be drasticly reduced. Since the car is driving itself there is no way that the driver can drive recklessly therefore greatly reducing the number of car crashes. So even if one of the drriverless cars gets into an accident it would be the manufacturer's fault because they are the ones hat are really driving here. So overall a lot safer than what we have now.

My next reason is that these cars a lot more gas efficient. The reason I say this is that they would always obey the speed limit exactly. Doing this should cut down on the gas used and therefore be much more efficient. In the long run this sabes everyone money except the gas stations.

Lastly this should decrease the need for insurance. In the article they said that these would be more like a taxi service so if they are taxi than no need for people to have insurance on cars. If everyone used these than no more need for car insurance at all. Which in turn saves even more money for people. So overall very good cost wise for people.

So these driverless cars will be a very positive thing. They will reduce car crashes, be more gas efficient, and decrease the need for insurance. In conclusion these cars will be awesome.",0
"Dear Principal,

I think community service should be required to all students. Students can learn a lot from helping others. In high school community service is required, so you might as well fit it into your schedule somehow before you get into high school. Students may say they have better things to do, but half those students probably really don't have anything to do. They can spend hours playing video games and being on Facebook every week, but can't devote to doing volunteer work. Volunteering isn't a priority to many, but its more of a priority helping your community or possibly the world, than playing video games or wasting time on the computer. Not all students play sports so its not hard to fit 1-2 hours of community service into their schedule. When we are spending time on the computer or on our phone, that's time being wasted that can be used doing volunteer work. That's why volunteer work should be required.

"The author fully supports the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit because of new technology and innovation.

There are many things to consider though.

The simularities between the two planets, the dangers of Venus, and why scientists are so amazed by Venus.

This means that pursuing Venus is a challenge.

The simularities between Venus and Earth are the size.

In paragraph 2 the text states that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in size and density, also the closest planet in distance too.

We are closer to Mars and other times Venus.

Because of the different speeds.

This means that Venus is close so it won't be a long trip.

The dangers of Venus that are harmful to humans.

In paragraph 3 the text states ""Venus has a thick atmosphere made up of 95% of carbon dioxide.

The clouds contain corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.""

The average temperature is over 800 degrees Farhenheit.

The average temperature is 90 times greater than Earth.

These conditions are beyond what we experience on Earth.

This means that Venus is uninhabitable compared to Earth.

Reasons why scientists are impressed by Venus.

In paragraph 4 and 5 the text states ""astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it was the most Earth like planet.""

Long ago Venus was filled with oceans, mountains, and creatures.

This means that scientists have things to consider before going to Venus and things to understand before going again.

This concludes that pursuing Venus is a challenge for everyone who wants to know more about it because of its dangers conditions, the scientist's fascinations about what life is like to be on Venus, and the simularities to Venus and Earth.

This means that we have a long way to go before we really see how it is on Venus.",0
"Dear Mrs. Principle,

I believe that you should allow kids to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch and free time , because if something bad is going on don't you think you or the police should know about it. And if you let kids use their phones during lunch and free time they will be less tempted to text in class because they are already done. Kids also will get higher grades if they pay attention in class when they already got their texting out. I can see how you feel about cell phones and you probably don't really want kids to use them at all, but it is probably better for all of the students if they use there phones when they know they 're allowed then when they are scared and stressing that they might get caught. Also if a kid is caught they will be focused on getting it back, who they were texting/calling, or how much trouble they will get in when they get home, but not their schoolwork.

"The Electoral College should get changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United State. Because the voter's vote are not for the presidents, instead they are actually for the slate electors. Which then go and vote for the president. Which isnt fair because for all we know, the state legislatures choose the electors that could go againts the will of people. Also because of the ""winner take all system in each state."" First of all the voter's votes aren't voting ofr the president, they are technically voting for the slate electors. For example, you think you voted for the president. when actually you hav voted for 34 electors pledged to that president. You won't know who those electors are, and sometimes ""the voters get confused about the electors and accidentally vote for the wrong candidate"".

Another thing that could happen is that the state legislatures can choose electors that can go againts with what the people choose. Like for example, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"". Also they can completely refuse to vote for their party's candidate and go and vote for who ever they want. Which wouldn't be fair to the people who thought they voted for the candidate. But in reality they voted for a party of electors that can go againts the party's candidate and vote for whomever they please.

The ""winner take all system"" is also unfair. because some candidates go to certain states where they know they have a chance of winning. But completely ignore other states that they know they won't have a chance in winning. Like for example, "" During the 2000 campaign, atleast 17 states didnt get to see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad"".

So in conclusion, The Electoral College shoud get changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Because The voters vote aren't really voting for the candidate. They are actually voting for the party of electors for the candidate. But those electors can refuse to vote for the candidate and vote for anybody else. Which woudn't be fair to the voter. And finally because the ""winner takes all system isnt' fair"".",0
"The revolutionary end to car culture could be creeping upon us more rapidly than we imagine. In the passage, ""Car-Free Cities"", authored by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky, they've elaborated a bit more on how cities all around the world are deciding it is time to decrease the use of automobiles, with the exception of hybrid cars and public transportation. The inhabitants of specific cities across the world have taken it into their own hands to reduce the usage of private automobiles in order to slow down pollution. In other places the government are pressing fines or taxes on those who drive their smog-emitting vehicles depending on the day or city. Some people are also commenting that the reduction of car usage has even brought about less stress in their daily lives.

In certain cities across the world, the people are open-mindedly accepting life without personal vehicles. In the first section of the passage, ""In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars"", Elisabeth Rosenthal shines light on a city in Germany by writing, ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."""" This allows for homes to be built without driveways and garages, thus reducing the size of the home, allowing more homes to be built in a suburb. Such houses allow for more people to become a part of a fast growing community with a dream to end pollution from personal car usage.

The governments of select cities are declaring specific days for there to be either a reduced number of vehicles on the roads or no vehicles at all, with the exception of public transportation. In section two of the passage, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, it is acknowledged that, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" By Paris enforcing these taxes they are acknowledging that someone has to at leats make an effort to reduce the levels of existing pollution.

By doing this people are able to live more stress-free lives.    ",0
"As times keeps passing new technologies seem to come around very often. From new cars and cellphones. To fully solar powered houses and computer controled homes. technology seems to be benefitting us. But what about the students? A new form of technology has been develope that is able to detect exactly how a student is feeling. But is it a good thing ? I beleive it is.

in today's modern day there is new software that has been developed that can detect a persons emotion. This is called the ""Facial Action Coding System"". This softerware is said to be able to contribute to a students learning ability. The article ""Making The Mona Lisa Smile"" presents the idea of a classroom using this technology in order to benefit a students way of the learning. In paragraph 6 of this article it reads, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ... Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor."" This expresses the idea of a more productive instructor that can help a student based on how they feel and individually help a student.

This new software could elevate the quality of learning. A normal classroom only contains one teacher in charge of various students with different needs. Each with a different style of learning. A computer system that can help each and every one of those students learn in their own way could be very benificial since the way they are being instructed is based on how they feel. The "" Facial Action Coding system"" is agood thing for our students and should be involved in our students leanring.                   ",0
"When a problem occurs, do you try your best or do you simply not care? Problems are a common thing and happens to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. Some things may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, you'll try hard to fix it. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you , it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

Problems happen to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. Many people take their time when they deal with something troubling, they all have their different strategies too. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better. you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier.

There are times that problems involve more than one person, and won't effect you only but others as well. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you don't know.

An example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesn't want you going far away and need your help. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. You'll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character.

Some problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and you'll try to fix it. There are problems that make it seem that you can't handle it alone. There are people that can help you, you're never alone. Even if you try your best it may not be how you want it to be, there are others who will help guide you, to have a good outcome. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. You never have to do anything alone, you might need the help of others and it's okay to do so.

There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. It happens to the best people and there is no way to stop problems from coming. It doesn't matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. You have to try your best when a problem presents, sometimes what seems right can turn out very wrong. You need to think if others will be effected, you can't just ignore a problem sometimes it could become bigger. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.

You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you, it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

No matter what you should always try your best, not only when a problem comes up. We should show our best when problems come up due to the fact that sometimes there are problems that can put you in danger or hurt you. You can't prevent problems from happening but you can have less you you do things correct the first time around. Some of these things will teach you lessons, maybe you did the wrong thing but you'll be wiser and know better. Everyone goes through something, tough problems can happen to anyone you just need to keep your head up and do what is right.",0
"Reducing work hours for school teachers is not a good idea. While it may seem like a good idea to give teachers more time off, it would ultimately harm the education system and students.

First, teachers play a crucial role in shaping the future of our society. They are responsible for educating the next generation and preparing them for success in the workforce. By reducing their work hours, teachers would have less time to plan and prepare lessons, grade assignments, and provide individualized support to students. This would ultimately lead to a decline in the quality of education and a decrease in the academic success of students.

Second, reducing work hours for teachers would also have a negative impact on the morale of the teaching profession. Teachers already face a lot of stress and pressure to perform well in their jobs. By reducing their work hours, they would have less time to focus on their own well-being and mental health. This could lead to burnout and a decrease in the number of qualified teachers in the future.

Finally, reducing work hours for teachers would also have a financial impact on the education system. Schools rely on the salaries of teachers to operate and provide education to students. By reducing their work hours, schools would need to hire more teachers to cover the same amount of work. This would require additional funding and could lead to budget cuts in other areas.

In conclusion, reducing work hours for school teachers is not a good idea. Teachers play a crucial role in shaping the future of our society and their well-being is essential for the success of the education system. By providing them with the support and resources they need, we can ensure that they continue to provide high-quality education to students.",1
" In my opinion, elective classes such as music, art, and drama should be offered as an alternative to core classes. While these classes may not be essential for graduation, they can provide students with valuable experiences and opportunities to explore their interests.

Many students choose to take elective classes in these subjects because they enjoy them and want to learn more about them. By making these classes elective, students can graduate on time while still having the opportunity to pursue their passions. Additionally, elective classes can be a great way for students to meet new people and expand their social circle.

While some may argue that these classes are less important than core classes, I believe that they can be just as valuable. For example, learning how to play an instrument or create art can be a great way to develop creativity and problem-solving skills. These skills can be applied to many different areas of life and can be a valuable asset in the workforce.

Furthermore, elective classes can also provide students with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. By choosing to take a class that they enjoy, students can feel a sense of pride in their achievements and be motivated to continue learning and exploring new things.

In conclusion, while elective classes may not be essential for graduation, they can provide students with valuable experiences and opportunities to explore their interests. By making these classes elective, students can graduate on time while still having the opportunity to pursue their passions.",1

"The idea of reducing car usage is a good idea, because the enviornment would be a better place. Limiting cars will not only benefit us with the idea of air pollution but with obesity, and obesity is a big thing in the United States. Its amazing how may people care about there enviornment. In source 3, Bogota, Colombia millions of columbians hike, bike, skate, or took buses to work during a day they call car-free day because they want to reduce air pollution.

In the United States one out of every 4 person is obese, and the reduction of car usage will help limit the obesity rate. Walking or even biking from one place to another is a work out and that is a common way to lose weight. We try so hard to reduce obesity and one of the many ways to gain weight is to eat junk food and not jog, run, or walk it off. So reducing the limit of cars is a good idea to reduce the obesity rate in the United States.

The reduction of cars will help the air polluting situation in the U.S. The pollution in the air will later in the future bit us right on the rear end. Many people may believe its happening now. The main cause of air pollution is the fuel we have running on our cars that are on the road 24/7. If we limit the usage of cars now we will start to see the difference in our world today.

Many people dont really use cars in the United States in source 4 it states that study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between the years of 2001 and 2009. It also stated that in 2005 the number of miles driven dropped steadily. Each year in America people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by a recent studies found. So believe or not not many people don't need a car to get to point A to point B.

As of today we should make a effort to stop using our cars and maybe walk to work and get your exercise for the day while doing it. Let make a change together and stop the mass of air pollution we have going on and and reduce the rate of obesity. Lets make our country a better place to be.                            ",0
"Have you evr wanted to help take care of animals on a boat, or even go see places that you have never seen before? Well then, you should come join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Thia will allow you take care of animals travel to different places, and trust me I have been on there it is very fun. If you are not persuaded enough let me give you 4 reasons why you should join.

The UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Now imagine that, while the animals were over seas the probably got hurt. Wouldn´t you want to help them I know I would. There were night watchmen, his job was to check on all the animals every hour. That sound like alot of work but it´s not.

Here is another reason, besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. I bet you haven´t seen Europe or China. Wouldn´t you like to see there lifestyle there clothes and all the other stuff they have. Probably learn a new language. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. It really was special all of ther colors were beautiful.

My last reason is, after we unloaded the animals we had alot of fun. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Now that is fun, all the time you were takig the animals back you had to keep an eye on them, but when they were unloaded you would have alot of fun.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up the world to me. I´m grateful for the opportunity, it mad me aware of people of other countries and their needs. This is why I think you should come and join Seagoing Cowboy program, trust me you will have fun.",0
"Dear state senator,

I personally believe that we should stick to and continue the idea of the Electoral College. For one, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted to vote for the right candidate. Secondly, there isn't much that can go wrong in the Electoral College. Last but not least, by electing a president of the United States through popular vote, the right person may not be elected to be president for our country.

To start off, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted by the parties to make the right vote for president. The Electoral College is a system that was created by the founding fathers created in the Constitution. When voters go off to the polls most have the thought in their mind that they are voting for their next president when they really are not. In the Electoral College there are 538 electors, which ever candidate gets the majority of 270 electoral votes wins the election. In source 3, the passage states ""When you vote for a presidentisl candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"". The electors that are in the Electoral College are selected by a certain party and the party trust that the person will vote for that certain party's candidate. With this process, the candidate that ends up getting elected is more likely the right candidate for the president spot.

Secondly, when using the Electoral College there ins't too many things that can go wrong. Most people that choose to go against the Electoral College would say that ""with the Electoral College its not really our choice when we vote because in the end the electors from the party vote for the president"". In source 2, the passage states ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" If a tie with the electoral votes is to ever take place, the House of Representatives would handle the election and state delegations would have the final vote for president. Also, if a tie does take place then the Senate would vote for the vice-president.

Last but not least, if we switch to the popular vote election process then the right president candidate may not always be elected. This point can go against both sides. The side that supports the Electoral College may say ""the people may vote for a certain candidate because of his color or race"". The side that supports the popular vote system may say ""when we go out to vote it doesn't count towards anything because of the electors in the Electoral College. So why are we even going out to the polls to vote?"" Also, with the Electoral College there will not be any run-off elections. In source 3, the passage states ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"".

In conclusion, I believe we should keep the Electoral College system going so we can have a more fluent election process. For one, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that the parties trust to make the right vote. Secondly, when using the Electoral College there isn't too many things that can go wrong with the election process. Last but not least, if we switch to the popular vote election process them the right president candidate may not always be elected. Senator I hope that we can continue the Electoral College election process            ",0
"Students do benefit from being able to participate in school despite not being in the building physically. Due to the program, students won't be behind on their work when they are able to physically attend school again. For example, if a student has received a disabling injury, and are not able to get to the school building or move around the school. They would then be able to do all of their work online, and not have to halt their education for the duration of their recovery. This program could also be useful if for some reason the school building is not fit for students to go to.

Say, for instance, a student suffers a blow to the leg, and it prevents them from venturing to their school building. In this situation, the teachers would have to send them physical copies of the work, which could get lost. If the work is available online, though, then the student can access all the work that they need to for the day, and do it from their current location. With the introduction of personal laptops, which the school has provided, the student will have all they need to do their work for the day.

With the looming threat of a Corona Virus outbreak in the United States, there is a possibility of a quarantine being enacted, and students will not be allowed to go to their respective school buildings. In such a scenario, being able to do their schoolwork from home means that the students education will not be put on hold. Also, if the school building were to suffer serious damage, like, for instance, a fire, the same would hold true for this scenario as well. It is much like the scenario for a single student not being able to attend school, but on a much larger scale.

There would be possible downsides, though. It is almost certain that a few students, the kind that you see vaping, or sitting in the back of the class, never doing their work, would take advantage of the out-of-building education. They would see it as an opportunity to get away from their teachers making sure they get their schoolwork done, and would treat the time spent out of the school, due to disablement or quarantine, as a kind of break from having to do work. While it is truly pitiable that they are simple enough to think that is the case, it could also be a kind of benefit. A way to weed out those students with a exceptionally poor work ethic. Their grades will drop, and they will realize that their lack of effort is the only thing to blame. And if they don't realize this, well, it's probably better that they will be held back and not introduced into society in their current state.

Overall, it is safe to say that the program is very beneficial to all students involved. They won't have to suffer a drop in grades because of an injury, and they won't have to put their education on hold in the case of the school building not being fit for use due to a quarantine or the building burning down. While there may be a few downsides in the lack of a physical teacher, Parents could step into that role and help the students get their work done. The program of allowing students to do their work online is almost exclusively beneficial, and will be very helpful in certain eventualities.",0
"The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something.

When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.

As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematically try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.

In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.",0
"While the ""Face on Mars"" may seem unusual upon first glance, I believe the evidence strongly suggests that it is simply a natural landform and was not created by aliens. There are several reasons to support this claim.

First, the article discusses how images of the Face taken at different angles and lighting show that it lacks the symmetrical features we would expect from an intelligently designed structure. Its appearance changes drastically based on viewing position. A structure created by intelligent beings would maintain clear defined features from all angles. 

Second, the article describes how images of the Face at higher resolution reveal that it is composed of mesas, hills and valleys that are typical Martian geological formations. Its sloping sides and uneven features are characteristic of erosion over millions of years, not precise engineering. If aliens had carved it, we would expect cleaner, straighter lines.

Furthermore, NASA scientists have identified similar natural landforms on Mars that closely resemble human or animal profiles, purely by chance. The Face's resemblance to a humanoid figure is likely also coincidental. Mars' weathering processes can truncate mesas into shapes that happen to look figure-like from certain perspectives.

In conclusion, while initial photos of the ""Face on Mars"" may promote speculation of alien visitation, a careful analysis of higher resolution images and comparisons to other Martian geological formations strongly indicates that it is simply a result of natural erosive forces over extended periods of time. Unless compelling new evidence can be found of artificial markings or materials, the most scientifically sound position is that it was not created by intelligent design but through normal planetary geological activity alone.",1
"Gun control is a very big issue and it's really important to talk about it. Some people think we need stricter gun control laws, while others don't. In my opinion, we need stricter gun control laws because it can help protect people from being hurt or killed by guns.

One reason why we need stricter gun control laws is that there are too many people who are using guns to hurt others. For example, there have been many mass shootings in the United States, where a lot of people have been killed or hurt. If there were stricter gun control laws, it would be harder for people who want to hurt others to get their hands on guns. This would make everyone safer and prevent a lot of harm.

Another reason why we need stricter gun control laws is that some people are not responsible with their guns. They might leave them lying around where children can find them, or they might use them to threaten or hurt others. If there were stricter gun control laws, people would have to be more careful with their guns and make sure they are kept safe.

Additionally, stricter gun control laws would help to reduce the number of guns that are available to people who might use them to commit crimes. If it's harder for criminals to get guns, they might be less likely to commit crimes. This would make our communities safer and reduce the number of people who are hurt or killed by guns.

However, some people think that stricter gun control laws would not be effective and would take away people's right to defend themselves. They argue that if people are allowed to have guns, they can protect themselves and their families from harm. But, in my opinion, this is not a good reason to oppose stricter gun control laws. If people are properly trained and licensed, they can still have guns for self-defense, but they would have to follow strict rules to make sure they are using them safely.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws would help to protect people from harm and reduce the number of guns that are available to people who might use them to commit crimes. They would make our communities safer and prevent a lot of harm. While some people might argue that they take away people's right to defend themselves, I believe that proper training and licensing can still allow people to have guns for self-defense while ensuring that they are used safely.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and whether it should be kept intact or changed to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After carefully examining the information from various sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the chance of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a popular vote system. In the 2012 election, President Obama received a much higher percentage of the electoral vote compared to his share of the popular vote, illustrating the stability of the Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral College system promotes a sense of national unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a candidate with merely regional support from being elected and ensures that the interests of all regions are represented. In a diverse country like the United States, it is important to have a president who can bring the nation together and consider the needs of all citizens.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the election results are uncertain. This focuses campaign efforts on key issues and allows voters in swing states to be more engaged and informed. These swing states represent a cross-section of the country and the opinions of their voters should thus hold more weight in determining the outcome of the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment gives smaller states a disproportionate advantage, the Electoral College restores some of the weight to larger states. This ensures that presidential candidates must consider the concerns and interests of states with larger populations, rather than solely focusing on the needs of smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College always produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and costs associated with conducting run-off elections, ensuring a smooth and efficient presidential election process.

It is essential to consider the counterarguments against the Electoral College, such as the alleged unfairness to voters and the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency. However, these arguments can be addressed through reforms and improvements within the existing system, rather than scrapping it altogether.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a valuable institution that promotes stability, national unity, and fair representation. While it may not be a perfect system, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and explore possible reforms to address any concerns raised by critics.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my perspective into consideration when making decisions regarding the electoral process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The Benefits of Spending Time Outdoors and Enjoyable Activities

Spending time outdoors has numerous benefits for both our mental and physical health. It provides a break from the daily routine of sitting inside and being glued to screens, and allows us to engage in activities that promote exercise, relaxation, and socialization. In this essay, we will explore some of the benefits of spending time outdoors and discuss three enjoyable activities that can be enjoyed outside.

First, spending time outdoors has been shown to reduce stress and improve mood. Being surrounded by nature, fresh air, and sunlight can have a calming effect on the mind and body. It can also increase the production of endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Additionally, spending time outdoors can improve cognitive function and creativity, as exposure to natural environments has been linked to increased creativity and problem-solving skills.

One enjoyable activity that can be enjoyed outdoors is playing catch. It's a simple and fun activity that can be done with friends or family. It's also a great way to get exercise, as it involves running, jumping, and throwing. Playing catch can be done in a park, on a field, or even in a backyard. It's a great way to bond with others and have fun in the sun.

Another enjoyable activity that can be enjoyed outdoors is riding a bike. Biking is a great form of exercise that can be done alone or with friends. It's also a great way to explore new places and see sights that you might not be able to see while driving. Biking can be done on a variety of surfaces, including pavement, trails, and even gravel roads. It's a great way to get some fresh air and exercise while having fun.

Finally, playing football is another enjoyable activity that can be enjoyed outdoors. It's a great way to get exercise, as it involves running, kicking, and tackling. It's also a great way to bond with others and have fun in a team setting. Football can be played on a variety of surfaces, including grass, turf, and even sand. It's a great way to have fun and stay active.

In conclusion, spending time outdoors has numerous benefits for both our mental and physical health. Activities such as playing catch, riding a bike, and playing",1
"Most may argue that one of the most important influences in a student's life is the role of a teacher. Teachers educate students on a daily basis how to be a porsperous individual and a good human being in life. Students often tend to utilize teachers as a support system in times of distress as a result of unhappiness and conflict in ones home. These educators are assigned with the imparative task of educating the next generation and future posterity on how to be the best of themselves to their ability. Teachers and students spend nine months out of the twleve months every year educating them on core and creative subjects such as art, science, music, and etc. The other three months belong to students being on break with no supervison or productivity in education. So during these three long months students are issued a summer project to keep them productive. Although some may argue that a teacher issued summer assingment limits the students ability to expand ones creativity, a teacher issued summer project is a more effective way to keep students productive as a result of students being irresponsible, oppertunity to seek help amongst classmates, and teachers having the best interest of a students education.

During summer break students have the tendency to be and make irresponsible decisions as a result of not having adult supervision. Students take summer break as a time for vacation, video games, spending time with peers, and other lesiure time. If students were given the oppertunity to design their summer project and spend time working on it rather than playing video games or going shopping at the mall; most students would take advantage of the situtation and not complete the assignment at all or put little to no effort into it. Since the majority of students want to be enjoying their summer vacation doing their favorite leisure activites before school starts in septemberthe majority of students will decide not to complete their assignment. For example, Generic_Name who is a high school student at Generic_School would rather play video games all day than stress himself on completing a project that he has to design himself without knoweledge of the teacher's grading rubric or set of directions to follow. Students cannot not be trusted with the task of completing a student designed project during summer break with all of the tempting distractions that surround them. Even though students could take advantage of the oppertunity by taking initiative on task assigned to them, allowing a teacher to issue the project would strike urgency and clarification for a student to complete this task. As a result of having a teacher issued project students can seek help amongst peers.

Peers and classmates can assits other students on the project if help is needed. Due to students having teacher designed projects, students may ask for assitance from fellow classmates for justification or clarity on ones liablities. For example, Generic_Name a high school student at Generic_School is having trouble with understanding the grading rubric; one of Generic_Name classmates named Generic_Name helps her by explaining the rubric thuroughly to her. Because students and other classsmates were issued the same project, they are now given the oppertunity to ask for help from classmates in order to increase their knowledge project score. Although critics may argue that individuality can be benefical to ones work ethic, working with others can broaden ones perspective seems to outweighs those critics. A project designed by teachers is suited to help a student perform at the best of his or her abillity.

Teachers have the best interest in what students need in order to suceed. As an influence in student lives, teachers and professors give students loads of work and tasks to challenge a student mentally in order to enchance ones ability to think critcally. If teachers do not challenge students, then students will become complacent with their detriorating work ethic and obtain a minimum level of critical thinking. This will result to students conforming with the unchallenging tasks and lead to failing grades. For example, Mrs. Generic_Name a teacher at Generic_School giving her students answers to the quiz before handing out the exam does not challenge students to critically think when taking Mrs. Generic_Name exam leading to the students recieveing failing grades as they progress to more complex levels of education such as IT, computer systems, and etc. These educators are assigning students these task in order to set them up for sucess in the future by challenging them now so the more complex assignments in the future becomes easier to them. Some may argue that teachers give an excessive amount of uncessary workload; however, the intention of challenging to stundents to be capable of critically thinking is seems to overpower the argument.

Most may argue that a teacher designed summer project is more benefical to keep students productive because the incapablity of students staying focus , assitance amongst peers, and in favor of students benefiting from completing task. Students cannot not be trusted completing task that interfere with them doing leisure activites as a result of many distractions. Working with others can expand ones knowledge to many perspectives and provide a social interaction with others which, enhances ones ability in teamwork. Teachers encourage challenging student because it allows students to think quickly and efficently eventually acting as a benefit to ones strengths. Teachers educate future generations to come so their role in each indivdual students lives are meaningful. As a result of a teachers great influence over a student these connections should be valued.",0
"Dear Principal,

I think the policy that you are considering is an out range to many athletes at your school or any schools as a matter a fact.

I think athletes like my self should at least have a 2.0 grade average because that's a C average and that should be good enough because not everybody is good at school some people aren't good at math , English , science , health , geography . so just because we cant a B in every class we cant get a B we cant participate in athletics?? That is a total out rage to all athletes and coaches because some of the best players on the team try their best in school and all the school subjects so just because they tried their best but still cant pull off a B they cant play that's not right.

Another reason why u shouldn't consider this new policy is because if you want your school to win a championship and get cool stuff for your school then you have to realize that the best players on the teams sometimes cant pull of a B in every class. And every team needs their best players to come up and play because without them no hard feelings but the teams might suck including your team. And playing without your best player is ruff trust me.

Im one of the captains of my basketball team and the best i can pull off in class is a C and trust me i do try to do my best sometimes the great basketball players arent good at school but im positive when i speak for the basketball players on every team that if one team member goes down others show up and play harder but that's sometimes not enough but like my coach says all for one and one for all.

So please don't consider this policy for your school because it'll just be a total outrage and chaos will happen with your basketball team.",0
"Students all across the U.S look forward to one special season,summer. Students want to be free from the stress of everyday school work and getting great grades. However, some students are not so lucky and get stuck with a summer project. Although they have three months to complete the project, students don't want to have to worry about yet another school project on their summer get away. If however, students get to pick what they do for their projects the story might be different.

Teachers have the best intentions when it comes to teaching, and giving out summer projects only means that they want students to continue learning outside of the classroom. Students are not going to be happy about it, this causes them to not want to the project over summer and when school comes back around they will say ""they forgot"" because for one, they don't want to do it and two, it may not be a topic they like or are interested in. Although, if students could pick what they want to do it will encourage them to do a topic of their choosing. This could lead to them becoming passionate about what they doing their project on and giving it their all.

Having them becoming passionate about a topic of their liking will lead to creativity. By the students enjoying what they are working on this will lead to them thinking outside the box and getting creative. This will also lead to good grade averages on the project and an increase in creativity. With this creativity also comes enjoyment that also leads to them wanting to do the project and get it done over summer. Though having a teacher based project will make it easier on the teacher to grade; the teachers should grade it off of creativity and much effort went into the project.

Students over the summer go through and do many fun and exciting things. They just can't wait to get back to school and tell their friends and teacher about all their unique exciting adventures, but what if they had something to help them tell their story. Nine out of ten students who chose their own project will create it from their own experiences. Allowing them to do this for their summer project will not only allow them to create some project for school, but it will also get them learn. Half the time students don't even realize they are learning something new when they are over summer break. By taking on this summer project though they will uninstinctivly choose something they have learned, seen, or done over vacation. Thus making their projects better in every way.

Summer breaks can be quite the treat for students, but they learn as they experience new things. The teacher would not have to worry about grading bad projects or worry about them turning in one at all, if they just let their students take the wheel and let them shine. Students will let their creativity come through and get down what they learned onto paper. No more boring summer projects that no one will turn in. Let the students decide how they want their summer project grade to go.            ",0

"Using an software on students cound be a helpfull software that could make it easier for them to know if the topic they are teaching is interesting or an boring topic. This could be helpful for teachers to know if they should go more in depth on the topic or should they stop and move onto something more interesting.

"As a student, summer projects does not sound appealing. In my years of school, I have never had to do any kind of summer reading or summer projects, and I am completely okay with that. However, they can be quite beneficial to our education, if done correctly. The debate is whether these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. There are pros and cons to both options. For example, student-designed projects could sound more appealing to the student and give them more control, but it could also end up not benefiting their education at all. Teacher-designed projects would ensure that we are benefiting our education, but it could cause students to not want to do the project, simply because it's work over the summer they are being forced to do. However, I think these projects should be teacher designed. It needs to be ensured the projects being done will benefit our education, otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of summer projects.

As a junior in high school, I know that over the summer I have no motivation to do schoolwork. So if I had to not only do a project, but come up with what to do, I probably just wouldn't do it, or I would procrastinate it until the end of the summer. If a teacher gave me guidelines and an outline of what I needed to do, I would already be one step closer to being done. If the project was teacher designed, it wouldn't help with the fact that most students would procrastinate their work and wait until the last minute, but it would still help because it's slightly less work the student has to do. With project outlines already given to students, they may have the motivation to get it done as soon as school gets out, so they wouldn't have to worry about it all summer.

While it may sound nice to do a ""student-designed project,"" it may end up not being beneficial to our education. We could do a really fun project that we enjoyed doing, but it may have no benefit to us, therefore defeating the entire purpose of school projects over the summer. So, if the teacher designed our project, they could ensure our project is benefiting us and helping us learn effectively.

Although I think the projects should be teacher-designed, I think the teacher should give a variety of options of projects to do. Different people learn in different ways. This way, the students can pick which project will benefit them the most, and have them learn the best. It would also be good because it gives the students more control over what they are doing, and how they are doing it. If I was only given one option, of one boring project, that would again cause me to lose motivation and cause procrastination. However, if I had several options of what to do, I could pick something I enjoyed doing. It would be a ""teacher-designed project,"" but would still give the students some control.

In conclusion, summer projects would be the most helpful to our education if they were teacher designed. There is nothing you can do about students procrastinating the project. However, if you give them a specific assignment (or a few options of assignments), they are one step closer to being done, and they wouldn't have to create and complete a project entirely on their own.",0
"Dear Principal,

I have been thinking about cell phones and why we should have them at school. You should allow students to bring their phones to school and let us only use them during lunch and other free times and then make us turn them off during class time. This could get a little worry off our shoulders, just a little bit. But for now here are some reasons you should let us have cell phones at school.

The first reason is about having them out during free time. Having them out at free time and lunch gives us a little more freedom, I think. We can get what every we needed done with our phones at those times and not in class bothering you and the teachers. This will let us ask our friend something that is in another room easier because then we are not asking to go here or there, disturbing others. This was one reason why we should have phones out in school.

My next reason is getting worries off our shoulders. By getting thing off our shoulders is if we left something at home for example we can text or call our family to bring it to the school for us and that will help us get our things to the teacher in time. Another example is if we are not feeling good we can call someone to come get us also.

Principal please think things over if you can and consider changing the schools policy to this. Hope that you will change it to this policy and so will everyone else. Everyone in the school will thank you for what you did if u do consider. So thank you and have a nice day.

Sincerely,

Me",0
"Dear, principal

We should be aloud to participate in sporting events with a c average because being in sports helps kids express their feeling and their sprit of accomplishment. If you would take away sports kids will protest and will never be aloud in sports because they can only get a c average. We wont have a big team in anything because nobody can get a b average except a few kids and that will draw to an end in the school sports programs and then well never be able to play sports. We kids need time to express our selves in sports learn to get better at it and keep on trying to achieve our goals in life. By not letting kids play sports they will change school to a school that lets them play sports with a c average. Parents will argue cause their kid can't play the sport that he or she want to play cause they have a c average. I think that kids with a c average or higher could be able to play sports but kids with d or f averages should have to get their grades up and get help if they need help. When you change the rules kids wont go to this school or their parents will argue with you about the rule change. This is why you shouldn't change the rules at our school to a student need to have a b average or higher to play sports.",0
"Letter for the principle

In this letter I'm going to explain which of the policies i believe is better. The policy that I think is better for the cell phones is the first because we could use the phone to ask question like in my case I forget thing and i could ask one of my friend to help me with the homework and if there a problem i could call the police and during class is good idea to turn them off because at some point phones are going to distract students from learning the subject or to study for a test and if you don't have a computer you could use your phone like for an example my phone I have the iphone 4g I don't have computer but i could go on the internet and search what my question is a video to show me how to do my projects. Maybe you left your lunch home grab your phone call your parents if they can they could bring your lunch.

the first policy i believe is better because many students like phone and want to call to have a little freedom to call someone a friend and i now that they could get distracted in calling everyone but that could be good way of communication to help out, to be in touch with your study group. maybe they had an accident in the school and no one has your parents number and your the only one.

so that's why i think that number one is the one that I believe is better. I believe too that this letter helped you out with your decision",0
"The face found on Mars is not made by alien. On April 1998 Michael Malins took a picture that was ten times. The autor is comparing the Eath to Mars how the the Earth has a of landforms so and Mars has a landform that look like a face.

"Dear senator I have a problem with the current voteing procesess. You see senator with Electoral Collage the votes can be swayed very easily, all one would have to do is threaten or bribe the voter into voteing for that particular person. This in-turn could effect the outcome of the voteing procesess greatly be it by leagal or ileagal means. Beacuse of this i think the voteing procesess should be based off of the popular vote so that it would be difficult for one to do what was stated above. But this is only one persons opinion there is also the other side of this.

There is another group that thinks that the voteing procesess should stay the same. i think that this group thinks this because they know how to get around the system or play it. Doing so makes it easy'er for them to have someone that they trust or control on the top of the game. But then if this ocuurs are we really choseing our president, i dont think so.

"Dear, principal

I don't think it is a good idea to change the grade point average that is required to participate in sports.

Some of the players would get kicked off the team because they just have a C and that could effect the whole team.

It could also effect your school because maybe the players are just so stressed from having to try to get a B instead of just a C.

A C is still a good grade.

A C is still passing and it shows that the person may not understand but he still try's.

When I get a C its because I tried but i don't quite understand the information.

I know a lot of kids that would be happy with just a C and they actually try in class.

My friend was on the basketball team and he got decent grades.

I remember that when projects came up he would be really stressed and I would help him out with his school work.

He would try but on certain things he felt like it was just way to hard.

Imagine if he had to get B' s, he would have been all stressed all the time and it was hard for him to just to get good enough grades just to be able to play a sport that he really loved.

Some kids are stressed and they don't really have to get grades good enough to play any sport.

I try for good grades and its easy because I have all the time after school to do my homework or maybe just work on a project that will be due.

The players on the team have to go to practice and then after that they do there homework but I would think they would be tired from having to practice for about on hour.

When I am tired I don't always do my best and that could effect grades.

The players have a lot to handle and raising what grades they have to have in order to play ,may just make them quit.

It sucks when you have to quit something you love just because its way to hard to keep balance.

If you raise the grade point average it will tip the balance and make it hard to be a basketball player.

Please don't change the grade point average.

"In my opinion, extending the school day by one and a half hours is a bad idea. The additional time would place an undue burden on students, drivers, and teachers. For students, the extra time spent in the classroom would leave less time for homework, activities, and family time; all of which contribute to physical and mental health. For drivers, it would mean more kids on the road during rush hour, potentially leading to dangerous situations and delays. Finally, for teachers, it would mean longer days with more lesson plans to create and teach. 

All in all, I think that extending the school day is not a good idea. It could lead to dangerous and negative situations for students, drivers, and teachers alike. There are better ways to improve education that don't rely on cutting into the precious time students have for other activities.",1
"One of the major criticisms of the Electoral College is its potential to undermine the principle of one person, one vote. The system, as it currently stands, assigns different weights to votes depending on the state in which they are cast. This means that voters in smaller states have a disproportionate influence on the outcome of the presidential election compared to voters in larger states. This distortion of the democratic process is no longer justifiable in modern times.

Additionally, the Electoral College discourages voter turnout in non-competitive states. Since the winner-take-all nature of the system means that the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state obtains all of its electoral votes, voters who support the minority party in non-competitive states often feel their votes are insignificant. This leads to a sense of disenfranchisement and alienation from the political process, ultimately dampening voter participation across the country.

Furthermore, the Electoral College perpetuates a two-party system and marginalizes third-party candidates. The winner-take-all approach makes it extremely difficult for third-party candidates to gain any traction, as they rarely win the majority of votes in any state. As a result, voters are often forced to choose between the two major party candidates, even if neither truly represents their values or interests. This limitation on choice hampers democracy by stifling alternative voices and ideas.

Moreover, the reliance on the Electoral College erodes the principle of direct democracy. It is fundamentally undemocratic for a group of electors to have the ultimate authority to override the will of the majority of voters. The electors are not constitutionally bound to vote in accordance with the popular vote in their state, which raises questions about the legitimacy and fairness of the system. The possibility of ""faithless"" electors undermines public confidence in the electoral process and undermines the idea of a government that is accountable to its citizens.

Critics of abolishing the Electoral College argue that it ensures that candidates must build broad-based coalitions in order to win the presidency. They contend that without the Electoral College, candidates would only focus on campaigning in densely populated urban areas, neglecting the concerns and interests of rural and less populous regions. However, this argument neglects the fact that candidates are already incentivized to campaign in competitive states only, disregarding the needs of non-competitive states. A popular vote system would force candidates to address the concerns of all citizens, regardless of their location.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic institution that undermines the principle of one person, one vote. Its potential to produce ties, its unfair treatment of voters, and its distortion of the democratic process are just some of the reasons why it needs to be eliminated. The United States should adopt a system that reflects the will of the people and ensures every vote is equal in its influence. It is time for America to embrace direct democracy and move towards a popular vote system for electing its president.",1
"Distance learning is an extravagant way of learning for those who don't necessarily have an easy option to go to public schooling. Even though some argue that the social interactions experienced at school help build a person's character; there are many cases where large classrooms actually cripple a student's potential. Distance learning has many benefits such as for people living in rural areas where transportation can be an issue. Distance learning students who have a hard time in social environments can find themselves excelling in the privacy of their home. Less school days would be missed due to the fact that outside weather conditions and school conditions would not be an issue. Also, less money would have to be poured into the transportation system and can be focused on other important aspects of the education system.

To start off, student's living in rural areas have a harder time getting to school and especially through a bus. These student's have to wake up earlier than usual and miss out on more sleep. You could argue that these rides help the student's create new friends but, these student's usually meet outside of school since they live close by. The more sleep and time a student has to themselves, the more successful they will be. Imagine this, a student living in a rural countryside lives about 35 minutes away from his school. Their school starts at around 8:00 AM. The bus would have to make multiple stops and the student's being the first. This would mean that the student would have to be ready to leave in time for the bus to pick them up and endure the rest of the stops. Being this early they would have to be ready by about 7 AM or maybe even earlier. He or she would then have to wake up at a comfortable time maybe 6 AM or earlier. The day before they had homework which they didnt finish until about 5 PM. To get more than 8 hours of sleep at that point you would need to sleep before 10 PM. This leaves the student with not even 5 hours of the day for himself. More time could be allocated to extracurricular activities if the student did not have to worry about getting up in time for the bus.

Secondly, there are many student's who suffer from social anxiety and many other issues with social interaction. distance learning can make a student feel comfortable from learning in their own home. Parents also have more control in a student's performance by being their to guide and support them through their studies. A student studying through distance learning will also be able to have more experience with technology. This added experience and knowledge will be critical in this advancing world. A lot of people will be able to find themselves taking heart to technology related fields or simply giving themselves new found passions. Students who otherwise despise going to school and having to deal with their ailment will find a new found love for school and learning. Take for example, a new high school student who suffers from social anxiety. This student would have to deal with tons of stress from entering a new environment with new people. He or she would be focused on the gratification of his peers while distracting him from his schoolwork. If this student was taking a distance learning program he would not have to force himself through this unnecessary stress. This student would pick up on vital learning abilities needed in high school to help him succeed in his upcoming years. Otherwise, without this type of program, the student could miss out on important opportunities through the stress and turmoil of worrying about his peers and image.

Also, a lot of school is missed due to bad road conditions or weather. Distance learning can help make sure that less days are missed so that students can stay on task. People who are critical to this topic could say that bad weather could take out energy thus making it useless, however these conditions rarely become bad enough to take out power sources. Student's without power would have more issues to deal with that would also disrupt their learning, so it would only be logical that learning for that day should be halted. There are more scenarios where distance learning would help in these conditions rather than have no impact. For example, on a snowy day, roads are too dangerous for buses and drivers to come to school. With distance learning, students would have the ability to still experience a full school day without their learning be crippled by transportation.

Finally, less money would be spent on transportation and less stops would have to be made. This could save student's more time in the mornings, and save the school money to enhance their learning experience. Buses would have less mileage and more gas. Student's who drive wouldn't have to worry about expenses towards their transportation. Also larger amounts of people can be accommodated by the school due to less people being physically in the classroom. More money could also mean raises to teachers which would satisfy the ongoing issue of teachers feeling like they aren't paid enough. Students will also be more enticed in a school career due to a larger salary. Schools will run a lot more smoothly and the field would be infinitely more respected by the new generation.

In conclusion, distance learning has a lot of benefits and brings forth solutions to modern problems. Students taking distance learning can better understand technology and how they feel about it. It would come to no surprise if we saw an increase of teachers and computer scientists due to the implementation of this program. School offices would be thrilled to use less money on transportation, and to see students enjoy their success without the turmoil of going through unwanted social interaction. Distance learning is an example of how technological evolution brings forth great changes to everyday life, and how we can get into a healthier mindset of change in the school system.",0
"The Face

The Face that was found on Mars couldn't have been created by aliens. If so where is the proof of these aliens. Ask yourself if you really believe the Face was created by aliens? Dont you believe their would be some sort of evidence after all of the exploring of Mars. In this essay I'm going to write a argumentive explaining why aliens could'nt have made the Face and why I belive it is just a natural landform.

I believe that this Face that was found on Mars could be a natural landform becuase of paragraph twelve. This paragraph says that the Face has resemblance to a butte or mesa, which are common landforms on Earth in the American West. It also states that it has resembalance to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These details are not exactly evidence that the Face is a natural landform, but it gives probable cause to think that it possibly is a natural landform.

For those who feel that the Face was created by aliens, dont you belive their would be some type of evidence of a life form on Earth. As paragraph eleven stated if their were other structures like pyramids, airplanes, or small shacks we would be able to see what they were because we could dicern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If their were aliens I'm sure NASA wouldn't keep it a secret because they would possibly get more donations or money from people wanting NASA to go up and get even more pictures. Or even for NASA to take people up there themselves like a trip.

Those who belive a alien created the face possibly would say that NASA would keep aliens a secret because it would frighten some people. They also could ask the question how and why did the rock or land for the way it did if its just a land form? For the first statement I can say that could be true, but the question I can't answer. I sure that someone who has studied it could though.

The alien belivers can also say that the aliens hide when humans come to Mars but that is something that can't be proven or disproven.

In conclusion, aliens couldn't have made the Face because their should be some type of proof that their has been life on Mars. Especially since we have photos of Mar's surface and have a rover on its surface. I feel that the Face is just a natural landform because it resembles a butte or mesa and because their is no sort of proof that their are aliens or any type of life form on Mars. Alien belivers could ask the question, how was the Face formed like a face, but I can't answer this question.           ",0
"Some schools in Virginia are adopt a program that benefit students that can't be in school for some reason. I agree with the idea,this idea consist that students can attend to their classes from home by the way of video conference or online.First, students with health problems are going to be benefit.Second, also students that have responsibilities in their homes, how having a full time job, can finish school with the help of this program.Finally, students that have problem with transport are also benefit with this awesome idea.On the other hand, some patterns said that their children have to be in school and have the same treat than other students and that schools should find another way to help these students.

I think the idea is going to be a great help for students with health problems.First, when my sister was in school she had problem with her legs and its' was very difficult for her to come to school every day,if this idea was approved four years ago it will help my sister a lot. Second, students with health issues in my school were very happy went their heard about the idea that our school was implemented so, its very difficult for they to come school when their feel bad. Finally, my friend PROPER_NAME is 15 years old he get sick easily his body defense are not like the others people and he was very happy when he heard the notice, he told me "" I can't believe that our school thought on me and the others students with disabilities"" I told him that I was very happy for him.

Students with responsibilities are also benefit.First, they can get a job and finish high school in the same time.Second,they can contribute on the house paying some bills how: pay their own room,bulling their food, or paying water and electricity bills.Finally, they are going to be in school and it is not going to affect them, if they are planning go to college in their future.

Students that have transport problem also apply. First, some students live to far and is difficult for they come to school and this idea is something that their are considering.Second, some students used Uber to come school and it is very expensive, some of them can't pay 10 to 30 dollars per day.Finally, some patterns are thinking to change their sons for another school that can provide transport to their sons.

In conclusion, students with health problems how my sister and PROPER_NAME are going to be benefit.Also many students that have responsibilities, like have a job to help their families students will help them and in the same time they are going to finish their school.Finally, students with transport problems can apply to the program many of them live to far and its hard to come school every day. I hope this idea can be implemented in many schools and help a lot kids like is helping the students in my School.",0
"Hey, so for this essay, I was like, totally stoked to write about how seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be super helpful in life. I mean, who doesn't love getting advice from people who know what they're talking about, right?

So, like, I started thinking about times in my life when I've sought guidance from people who are, like, really smart or experienced in something. For example, when I was trying to decide which college to apply to, my parents were like, totally helpful. They asked me what I wanted to study and what kind of career I wanted, and they helped me research different schools that would be a good fit. And, like, it was really helpful because they knew way more about colleges than I did.

But it's not just parents, right? I mean, there are tons of other people who can give good advice. Like, my coach is super smart about sports and stuff, so when I'm trying to improve my game, I go to him for tips. And my friends, they're like, really good at some things, so when I'm trying to decide on a movie to watch or a book to read, I ask them for recommendations.

And it's not just about, like, personal stuff. There are also experts in different fields who can give really valuable advice. Like, if you're interested in science or history or something, you can go to a professor or a scientist and they can teach you way more than you could ever learn on your own.

But, like, the thing is, you have to be willing to listen and take their advice. If you're not willing to, like, open your mind and consider other people's ideas, then you're not going to learn anything. And that's why it's important to be brave and make your own decisions, but also to be willing to ask for help when you need it.

And, like, I know some people might be thinking, ""Well, what about when the experts are wrong?"" Or, ""What about when their advice doesn't work?"" And that's a good point, but I think it's important to remember that no one knows everything, and even experts can make mistakes. So, like, it's okay to question their advice",1
"Online Learning: An Ineffective Teaching Method

With the emergence of modern technology in our everyday lives, it often seems logical that it should be integrated into our school systems.

Many schools allow children to take classes online through ""distance learning"" programs.

However, online learning is not nearly as effective as physical school at teaching children and giving them a solid understanding of the subject matter.

It allows students to fool around without restriction and encourages them not to attend school in the first place.

Furthermore, school should stay primarily uninvolved from the home life of a child.

Some think that it would be especially great for those who cannot physically attend school because of health reasons.

Those individuals should be focussing on recovering rather than their education.

Online learning is not nearly as effective at educating students.

At the school I attend, online courses are offered as a replacement for physical classroom courses.

From speaking to others that have taken online courses, they all view them as a nuisance that does not teach them anything comparable to taking an actual class at school.

All of the students who have taken them do not think they have really learned anything because of them.

This makes sense because of how easy it is to get distracted when on the computer.

Even students with good self control have difficulty sitting in on a virtual lecture when pressing the new tab button and opening YouTube would be simple.

For this reason, online classes will never be capable of matching the teaching capabilities of an actual learning environment, like school.

Aside form the evident issues of productivity and effectiveness of online education, home should be a place where school should stay primarily uninvolved.

Everyone looks forward to a returning home after a hard day of work or school.

If school primarily takes place at home, then students will associate their own safe place with hard work and frustration when it should be a place to decompress.

A separation between learning and relaxing locations is necessary for optimal learning conditions.

Many think that online schooling would be a good way to avoid kids having to attend school, especially for those who are not physically able to.

Online schooling may be useful for children who are to sick to attend school, however it does not provide any useful advantage to students who are capable of attending school normally.

Also, students who are not physically able to attend school for medical reasons should be focusing on recovering rather than schoolwork.

If online schooling is given as an option over normal education, it will allow more kids to slack off without the encouragement and motivation that a physical classroom provides.

It would also eliminate the beneficial seperation between school and home life.

Online learning is an ineffective teaching method.        ",0
"How do you feel about the electoral college? It's really useless if you ask me. Where not even voting for the president ""but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Just think about what i said and try to make sense of it.

Electoral collage is very useless why do i say this you may ask. Well like source 2 says and gives you a great example ""if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledge to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" A good question you might be asking yourself is, that who are the electors? Well  they can be anyone not holding public office states source 2. Another problem is that the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. All you can do is just prey for the best.

Another good reason on why i feel very negative towards electoral college is that ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"" states source 2. So you are basically voting for someong to vote for who you want to vote for and they  might not even defy your will. The electoral collage is just not fair to voters. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in sates they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in  the swing states.

Over all ""electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". They are completly right think about you dont wanna give the wrong person all the powers the president has.                                                                                                      ",0
"Their is a group of people called the Seagoing Coyboys, they are a very unique group of people who travel all over the world and experience alot of different things. One thing that they experience is what other people need and some places can inform you about many different things like animals and rare animals. Their also can be dangerious parts of this job allthough it sounds fun. You are taking a big risk traveling over seas alot and dealing with the weather and the ocean waves. There may also be a chance of taking care of animals like feeding them and caring for them to keep you bussy.

The Seagoing Cowboys is a very amazing job to have. People should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it will be very interesting depending on what type of person you are. If you are an explorer and you dont have any moey to travel if you get a job like this you will go places that you never even heard of before. Maybe you like going through rough weather like hard rain or 20mph wind for example. If you do like weather like that then this is the job for you because you travel over seas alot thats why the name of the group is called Seagoing Cowboys. Also when you turn 18 you will be old enough to join the military service. You can also have fun when your in the Seagoing Cowboys they play sports like baseball, tennis, basketball, and they also have reading clubs adn writing clubs.

I would join the Seagoing Cowboys if I could. Just think about it, why wouldnt you. Its a very unique group of people and they go on adventures and they have fun also what more could you ask for. There is one thing though, when you travel to far places it will take long periods of time like weeks.      ",0
"Must all students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity? Some schools make their students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity whether the students want to or not, the students don't really have a say. I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity. The principle might just want to help the students so that they can get into a good college or just into a good school in general. There are many reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity. Some reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity is simply because they might not have time, their parents may not want them to, and they might just not be interested in extracurricular activities at the moment.

Having to take an extracurricular activity is a big responsibility in a way. Students might not have time because just like anybody else they also have a life outside of school and they have things that they need to do everyday. They might need to watch their siblings while their parents are at work, also they have homework for almost every class and apart from that they still have to do chores around the house. The students might really want to do a sport or join a club or maybe even do both but they might not be able to. The reason being is because they would then have to go after school so that they can go to practice for a sport or meet up with the other people from the club. There's a specific time you have to be there and if you can't make it you might get kicked out of the club or sport or any other extracurricular activities.

Not having enough time might not be an issue but maybe their parents just dont want them to participate in anything. There are many reasons as to why this can happen, the student might get hurt really easily if its a sport or maybe even by doing simple everyday things, their parents might not be able to take them back to school when school is over because they might not have transportation, the parents could even possibly think that its dumb. There are many more reasons as to why their parents might just not want them to join a club or a sport or even just an after school class. The parents have their reasons because it's their child and they want to do what's best.

Lastly the student might just not want to do anything at the moment. They get a lot to do in school and they still get homework, then when they get home they might just want to relax. They might be thinking about doing sports or something else this upcoming year but just not now. students get really stressed with all the work that they get that they might just not want to add more stress by having one more thing to worry about. maybe they are military and they might have to move to a whole different place where they don't know anyone so they want to take a year off to get to know some people before they start joining anything.

Students shouldn't be made to take an extra curricular activity because they simply might not have time, their parents might just not want them to, or they might just not want to take any extracurricular activities at the moment. They should be able to have a choice of whether they want to take an extracurricular course or not. Students shouldn't have to do more than they have to if they really just don't want to or if they can't. Students are trying their very best in school so they shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity if they don't have to.",0
"The author supports this claim since he talks about how its very hard to travel to Venus. The thick atmospere is 97% carbon dioxide. The average temperature is 800 degrees fahrenheit. The pressure is 90 times greater than Earths pressure. Their are many earth quakes and volcanoes on Venus.

Many astronomers are faccinated by Venus since they think a long time ago it was covered by an ocean and had life forms living their. NASA has an idea to send humans to Venus to study the planet and its condition. They would send a blimp like vehicle hovering over Venisian landscape It would be hovering over Venus for about 30 miles. The people that they send to Venus would not have any samples from the planet since they would not touch or be in the surface of Venus.

NASA knows this is a big risk but they are still willing to take it. They have simulated a kind of material that would be used in Venus and it lasted for abouut 3 weeks. The computers now are fast, powerful and flexible but they can stand the condition Venus has. Even though its dangerous to go to we should always take risks. We should explore more places but we still dont have thaat kind of technology.

Venus could be a habitable planet. The idea of sending a blimp like vehicle to Venus is smart but dangerous. The blimp would only last 3 week if it was sent to Venus. The blimp has to be floating about 30 miles away from the surface. The computers indie the blimp would have to be srtong and fast to survive. The planet does not have easy conditions but is suvivable for humans.

Venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system. Venus is hotter than Mercury even though Mercury is closer to the sun. The reason Venus is hotter than Mercury is because of its gases Venus contains in its planet. Venus is hot enough to liquefy any metal.

Even though Venus is not habitable in its soil we could still live above its soil. We would have to get used to the lightning and massive earth quakes this planet has. Its nearly imposible to live in the soil of Venus.",0
"In addition to limiting the use of cars, another effective way to reduce pollution is by promoting and utilizing alternative modes of transportation. Public transportation, cycling, and walking are viable options that not only contribute to the reduction of pollution but also offer numerous benefits to individuals and society.

Public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and trams, provide an efficient and environmentally friendly means of transport. They can accommodate a large number of people and help reduce the number of individual cars on the road, thus decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to source 1, public transportation in Europe is responsible for significantly lower emissions compared to private cars. By opting for public transport, individuals can actively contribute to the reduction of pollution and the overall improvement of air quality.

Cycling and walking are not only eco-friendly alternatives but also promote a healthier lifestyle. Source 3 highlights the streets of a capital city being free of traffic jams, which encourages citizens to walk or cycle instead of relying solely on cars. These active modes of transportation not only reduce pollution but also enhance physical fitness and mental well-being. Furthermore, cycling and walking can help reduce traffic congestion, resulting in less time wasted in traffic jams and faster commuting times.

To encourage the limited use of cars and the adoption of alternative modes of transportation, governments and local authorities should invest in the development of comprehensive and reliable public transportation networks. Additionally, they should prioritize the construction of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes and pedestrianized zones, to facilitate and encourage the use of these modes of transport.

Furthermore, individuals can also contribute to the reduction of pollution by practicing carpooling and ridesharing. Carpooling allows multiple people to share a single vehicle when traveling to a similar destination. By sharing the ride, the number of cars on the road is reduced, resulting in lower emissions and less traffic congestion. Ridesharing services, such as Uber Pool and Lyft Line, have also gained popularity and offer a convenient and cost-effective way of commuting while minimizing pollution. Embracing these practices can have a significant impact on reducing pollution levels and improving overall air quality.

In conclusion, limiting the use of cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation is crucial in mitigating pollution and its detrimental effects on the environment and human health. By reducing the reliance on individual cars, individuals can contribute to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating stress, saving money, and ultimately ensuring a cleaner and healthier future for generations to come. Governments, communities, and individuals must work together to prioritize and invest in sustainable transportation options, leading us toward a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future.",1
"Intro-The technology would be valuable because it would allow students to focus on their assingments. This technology could keep students on task and allow for them to have a learning environment that they could thirve in. This technology could also create a better world in general by enhancing the future generations knowledge.

Body 1-Technolgy has become a everyday thing in our lives and has created many distractions for students. With this new technology students could continue focusing on what's important, their school work. This would make students grades improve and allow them to have a better oppurtunity in the real world. Occording to the text, the technology would also allow ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means the technology could adjust itself to learn how the student works, instead of the other way around. Also ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" meaning that the technology would work for each student around the world.

Body 2- This technology would also create a better living environment across the globe. This is because computers could explain lessons to students in ways a human couldn't. The computer could analzye the students face, see any confusion, and change the lesson plan into what the individual student needs. This is all plausible because the text omits that the technology ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could make jobs easier for teachers, and increase the future generations knowledge by teaching them more than a human could.

Conclusion- This technology could seriosly improve schools for the better and allow them to forever change how we learn. Students could be individually taught, and they would always learn because the computer would still know if the student is confused or not. This could create worldwide peace because students could fully grasp from histories mistakes and continue to forever make the world a better place.   ",0
"Smog, acid rain, high carbondioxide levles, all of these things are due to pollution. In many contries the leaders have put a ban towards cars. Paris France, Vauban Germany, Bogota Colombia, and even the United States of America have/are thinking about putting a ban on cars or other transporting objects. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage; limiting pollutians in the air, saving money, and having a healthier life style.

Cars can cost a pretty penny espically if their new, and many low/middle class family's have trouble keeping up with the bills that come with a car. Car payments alone can run up to $300 a month. Then theirs insurance, and if your car happends to need a change of oil, or breaks theirs another 200-300 dollar  payment. That's why people are starting to buy fewer and fewer cars each year. After the peek in 2005 car percheses have droped tramendiously, with less people deciding to get a license.

Not getting you license dosn't mean you cant get around, it just means that you have to find other means of transprotatin. Biking, walking, even riding on your skateboard can get you from point A to point B. Cars are bigining to become obsoliet, not being used in larg suberbs, or highly populated cities. People have started to walk to work and that has a large impact on health. With people having privet cars they dont feel the need to have phisical activity every day. This could be contrabuting to obeasity. With cars being out of mind people are starting to get exersize just by walking to work. Cars have also contrabuted to many deaths all over the world. With new technology comming out many drivers get distracted. Wether its talking on their phones, trying to pick up something thats' dropped in the back seat, or even trying to dig something out of your purse. Not all drivers are a fault tho, many other accidents happen because of padestrians not paying attention. These accidents could be prevented though, by just getting rid of the use of cars.

Passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gass admitions in europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States. If we got rid of most privetly owned cars though, it world bring that pecentige down tramendously. In Paris the record high pollution finally had them pass a partial driving ban untill the thick smog cleard the city streets. congestion was down 60% in the streets of paris, and after 5 days of intensifying smog it had finally cleard.

Cars all over the world are slowly becoming less and less used. This could help the pollution, health and save money. these advantiges to getting rid of cars is going to become a topic thast we will talk alot about for ages, until cars become compleetly and totaly obsolite.             ",0
"Working in a group is like, super beneficial, you know? Like, it's like, you get to share ideas and stuff, and find different information that you might not have thought of on your own. And if someone gets sick or something, you can just pick up where they left off, you know? It's like, way easier than trying to do everything yourself.

Like, for example, when we did that project on ancient civilizations in history class. I was like, totally stuck on this one part, and my groupmates were like, ""Hey, man, we can help you with that!"" And they showed me this cool website with like, super detailed info on the pyramids. I never would have found that on my own, you know?

And it's not just about finding new information, it's also about getting more support from the group. Like, if you're working on something and you're not sure how to do it, you can ask your groupmates for help. They might have a better way of doing it, or they might know something you don't. It's like, way more efficient than trying to figure it out on your own.

I think working in a group is super beneficial because it's like, you get to learn from each other. You can like, build on each other's ideas and come up with something way better than you could have on your own. And it's also way more fun than working alone. You can like, brainstorm together and bounce ideas off each other, and it's just a way more collaborative and creative process.

So yeah, working in a group is definitely beneficial. It's like, way better than working alone, and it's a great way to learn and grow as a team. And it's not just in school, either. Like, if you're working on a project with your friends or something, it's way more fun and productive than trying to do it all by yourself.

"Not all students have the summer to relax and have fun. Some schools have their students complete a project over the summer to make sure they continue learning over the break. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would give the students a rubric, and the students don't have to worry about coming up with a project.

The summer projects should be teacher-designed because they give you a rubric. Not all projects or assignments have a rubric to go off of. Whenever I have a project or assignment from a teacher, I would prefer a rubric so I know what I have to include in the project. A rubric is nice to have because you won't include things that are unnecessary to the project. If you choose the teacher-designed project, you have a rubric to go off of.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the students don't have to worry about coming up with a project. As a student, I prefer not coming up with the summer assignments because I over think about coming up with ideas for projects.

Having the teacher give me the assignment and what to put in the project is better for me. The teacher-designed projects would show what we have to put in the project.

Although, having the projects teacher-designed gives the students a rubric and what they have to do, the summer assignments should also be student-designed. It should be student-designed because the student can do a project on something that interests them, and they will become more responsible for their project and they're findings. However, teacher-designed projects have everything planned out for the student, so the students don't need to worry.

These summer projects should be teacher-designed because they have a rubric to go off of and the teachers give you what it is expected on the project. Next time there is a summer project and you have to option of doing it your way or the teachers way, or teacher-designed, do teacher-designed. It will be easier for you, and it won't be difficult to come up with ideas or make a checklist, or rubric, for yourself.",0

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students should have to do community service like pick up liter. Many students may think it is a waste of time but it is actually helping the environment. By helping the environment, they are really doing more then they think. Many things can be hurt if there is liter everywhere. By helping the environment there can be more then they expected.

All of the students should have to do community service and pick up liter. By picking up liter, students could take another turn and do lots more to help the environment. When the pick up trash off the road, ground, and anywhere, students can get a sense of maturity. If students take a responsibility and pick up trash and any community service they may even try better at school and anything else. With students doing community service, they will have more sense to do community service more often.

If students decide that they want to do community service, its fine. When students just fell like liter won't do anything, they need to actually try and see what and how much it can do. If students start to change there daily routine they might even see how it is like to help and serve the community. The way students think of how liter isn't much, they need to actually see how much there is and to see where it is, on the road, on the ground, and even in there own community park.

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that the people and influences around me play a significant role in shaping my character. My family, friends, teachers, and community all have an impact on who I am and how I behave.

My family is the foundation of my character. They have taught me important values such as honesty, respect, and responsibility. My parents have always encouraged me to do my best and to be kind to others. They have also shown me the importance of hard work and perseverance. I have learned to be a good listener and to communicate effectively from my siblings. My family has also taught me the value of family and the importance of being there for one another.

My friends also play a significant role in shaping my character. They have taught me about different cultures and perspectives, and have challenged me to think critically about the world around me. They have also taught me the importance of being true to myself and to follow my passions. My friends have shown me the value of loyalty and trust in relationships.

Teachers have also influenced my character. They have taught me important academic skills such as reading, writing, and math.

"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should have the students perform community service. I think that community service is very important but some of the other students think it is a complete waste of time. So I would like to add a ""trash clean-up"" project for the students who do nothing, or want to help out the school during recess time. It will be on or around campus during the lunch period for fifteen minutes a day. Then the next few days after the school is cleaned up, we should have ""reading buddies"" for students in preschool and kindergarten. it will give younger students a larger vocabulary, and give the older students higher social skills. I clean up the playground during recess, read to students, and I bake cookies for the elderly people at the local retirement home.

They can do those for the community service you want the students to do at school, and give us a better outlook on life.

Thank you,

A student.",0
"Gas prices. Car notes. Parking fines. These are all expensive things you have to pay for when you consider owning a car. Most family get rid of their cars because of having to pay these high prices in order to keep their cars.

There are a couple of car free cities;for example German Suburbs is car free because of expensive fees they would have to pay just to have a space to park in,.""but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space,for $40,000,along with a home.""These families would have to spend $40,000 along just to park their car in a large garage,it makes it easy for them to make the decision not to own a car because prices are so high. Having to buy a parking space for that much and still having to buy a home along with the $40,000 can cause a lot of stress on family providers because they have to basically spend all their money on one high priced item;a CAR!

You can become much happier without a car knowing that you don't have to spend all your money on this one item that could break down on you at anything,""As a result,70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."". For example, this mother of two is much happier without owning a car,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""The mother of two became much happier because she no longer had to pay these high fines,fees,gas prices,and car notes that others had to pay for. It was other was to get around that you didn't have to bother coming out of pocket for such as,""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. This was a big help to limiting car usage.

Studies show that the percentage of driving has dropped tremendously from 2005 to 2013. Most of the reason for the driving percentage dropping was gas prices;It began to get to high,President Obama tried to do something about it as much as he could.""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions,unveiled.""Fewer cars were seen on the roads driving,""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""It caused people to not drive their cars and take public transortation or not go anywhere at all. It got to the point where""cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars.""

Some of the advantages to limiting car usage are just what us as Americans want/need to hear because its really expensive. It's not just about buying a car and running it off of air;your car takes gas,car notes,needs servicing every once in a while it's not easy owning a car.

I think you should let students do community they want to I know you care for the and our well being the students in the that are doing community is doing the right thing buy doing but the students that don't want to do it that's up to the not you may be the principle but you can't make people do things they don't want to do you don't have that power. You should let the students do it on free well that well make things much east for you are principle you have a lot of things you do. So don't put to much stuff on yourself . Because if all the students do community service they wont have a lot of time to stay for test that are coming up and some times the students have to skip class to water the plants for the community plant sale they have going in the city its a big thing now. Students wont have the time they have now as students any more if you let them do it and they have do community service when its the weekend when have a day without no one after you about some thing than you get a phone call its for community were you have see kids work when its your day off. You don't wont that to happen do you so you should let the students have to community thing go cause not a lot of people are going to anyway no students is going to give up there weekend for community service I love the community with all my heart and I to get but asking students is not the way you need to go way over that you should take this to the president of the U.S he can maybe take care of that little problem you have so that wont be a problem any more I hope so that is what I had to say to you.",0
"Summer assignments are one of the aspects of summer break that students dread the most. It can make your Summer go from one hundred to zero really quickly, especially if it's late August and you just remembered it. Students dread it because it's so tedious and time consuming that it's less of a learning experience and more of a back breaking chore. Although, if they were made by students it would be a different story. Summer assignments should be assigned and designed by students and for students because otherwise they can be jarring and time consuming. Also if students were to make them, then it could touch more students on a personal level and have more creativity.

Summer assignments can feel repetitive and boring when some teachers assign it, especially reading assignments. It often boils down to the same formula: Read or research a book or topic, write an essay, make a connection, and sometimes something interesting is thrown in if you're lucky. Students most likely dislike doing it because it gives them nothing but a dry and lifeless ""challenge"", headaches, and wasted time for a grade. Also, a lot of teachers mistake challenge for difficulty when they are two vastly different things. Something can be challenging and easy, which is what summer assignments should be. They aren't hard or challenging in any way, it's just annoying. Additionally, the books are often chosen for you instead of finding one yourself, and even that's a gamble because you don't know if you'll like the book or not. Which makes the connection part harder because you may not connect with a single character in the book.

Students understand the pain and strife of other students, be it hard work, strict teachers, tight deadlines, or all of the above. What they also have a better understanding in, is that students don't want to spend a month, sometimes two, of their break doing research on a topic they don't care that much about. As well as they don't want to read a book in it's entirety that they didn't choose. So naturally they'll bring far more practical and interactive ideas to the table. Such as having them read from a genre of their choosing, or maybe having them analyze a movie or poem, or just having them do a project on an issue that affects them. It'll keep the same purpose of the summer assignment, keeping you working and educated while you're out of school, while making the whole experience less painful and tedious to go through.

Something that people might think when it comes to students making the assignments is they might make it too simple, thus making it ineffective. As well as the point of the boring books is to help students widen their vocabulary or show them . But, there are many ways to better someone's vocabulary than to thrust a four hundred plus page book onto them. Such as using a shorter book, maybe let them broaden it on their own fruition etc. Also, it is possible that there may be someone trying to help the others get out of jail free by giving them a low effort assignment. But, an easy way to fix that is to have a group of students rather than just one or a couple, then they could all vote and see which idea would benefit the most people. Furthermore, an easy assignment that students will enjoy and have fun with as they work is far better than a ""hard"" assignment that no one will enjoy.

There's nothing wrong with the idea of summer assignments on paper, but in practice it falls way short. But students can provide other students with a fun and truly challenging way without the hassle of bogus material. Naturally, this seems like a far fetched idea, having students assign any kind of assignments, but it might not be so bad if we just give it a try. Who knows, maybe the students will feel more inclined to do their work if they weren't getting the same thing every year.",0
"People all over the world would love to travel to Venus; to learn new things about the planet, and what it actually looks like, but it is very dangerous. Venus may be very cool looking and theres so much to learn about it; things you might of not of known. It may be to impossible to tavel to this planet, there are to many dangerous things that happen and it would not be safe. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports their idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author gives so much information about Venus and the dangers, and to study it than to visit the planet is safer.

Even though Venus looks very cool looking and fun to learn about, well it is, but it would not be safe to travel to Venus. The author in this article gives a lot of information about venus such as, the goods and the bads, and why and why not one should travel to that planet. In the aticle ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system."" Venus is dangerous, it is very hot and has the hottest surface out of all the planets. The author supports their suggestion by putting out there the fact of how hot Venus is, and that studying Venus is a worthly pursuit.

Venus looks very cool and most people wish they could travel there, but it wouldn't be such a good idea. Venus is very dangerou in many ways and you wouldn't be able to be by it in a spaceship, it's far from fun to visit. Studying Venus gives you a lot more information then to visit and might be able to make it back. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports their idea by giving information about Venus and the dangers that it has.    ",0
"There are many challenges stated in the article about exploring Venus. In the next paragraph I will write a claim on how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers and an explanation of the evidence to my claim.

In my opinion, I think that the author didn't do a very good job on explaining the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because the author didn't give much evidence that it is about the pursuit being worthy. In the article the author explains a lot about the challenges of exploring Venus like the extremely hot temperatures and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,"" but doesn't explain very much about it being a worthy pursuit. The most that is talked about it being a worthy pursuit is getting insight on the planet like getting samples of the sediment on the surface of Venus and possibly getting the history of the Earth-like planet that is in our solar system.

In conclusion, I think that the author did not have very many good explanations for studying Venus on being worthy pursuit despite the dangers. ",0
"Attending classes from home is not bad. While students have a hard time in the classrom, distance learning can be best for them. Because they are distractions in the classroom, taking classes from home can help you focus and get you into college.

Because school is one of the main focus in life, you have to go in there and focus on your work. School will get you to your goal. However taking classes at home will give you a higher chance to reach your goal. Because there are no distractions and you are fully focused on your work. Also your gpa can increase, the higher the gpa the can take you to a great college.

Friends can be a distractor in the classroom. Having a friend is a good thing just for the right time. Friends are always fun to be around but school is more important. Taking classes at home there are no friends. You are focused on your work. You can hang out with your friends on the weekend or when school is over.

Taking classes at home can be more relaxing. You can accutually lay up in your bed and have a video confrence. Furthermore eating anytime is great, dont have to wait until lunch to go eat. Also you can be on your phone but only for the right things. Also you can sleep in until its time for class.

In conclusion, taking classes at home is highly recomended. Because it can rise your gpa with the one on one confrence calls. Also you are foucused because there is no one distracting you, taking classes at home can get you into college.",0
"Dear Principal,

Considering the two cell phone policies, I personally think the first policy that allow students bring cell phones and use them during free time is better. Parents gave cell phones to their children because they want to know about how their children are doing at school; did their children get to school safely; and keep contacts with their children. Therefore, children need to bring a cell phone to school, to tell parents they got to school safety, so parents don't have to worry all day.

If their is an emergency that children need to call their parents or family members, cell phones are the easiest and fastest way to contact them.

However cell phones should be turn off during class time, because they are distractive not only to one person, also to the whole class, it interrupted the teacher or the students and wasted some class time for students to learn. For example, if 30 people's cell phones ring at the same time and everyone picks up their phones, then the entire class period is wasted.

As you can see, cell phones should be turn off during class times in order for the students to learn things using the entire class periods.

Most teens today have a cell phone, there are all sorts of cell phones who designed for teens who like to text, teens who like to go on internet on their phones, and teens who love to talk on a phone with friends. Cell phone is a easy, fast, and fun way to communicate with others. Students should have to right to do what they want. Also, talking texting, and do whatever they want on cell phones enjoying their free times and lunch periods do not effect others from what they are doing.

Over all, The first policy is the most suitable policy for the school, because students can bring cell phones to keep contacts with their parents to let them know that students are safely arrive school every morning, so they have the peace in mind to focus on their works. However, cell phones should be turn off during class periods, because it is distractive to the class, and keep others from learning. Also, students should use their cell phones during their free times and lunch periods, because it is a way to enjoy their lives without distracting others.

Sincerely,

"February 17, 2011

Dear Principal,

I understand why you are reconsidering our school's cell phone policy. I know it can be extremely distracting to have someone texting or talking on the phone behind you. I believe that cell phones should not be completely banned from the school, but to let students use them during free time or lunch periods.

Students should at least be able to have their cell phones in their free time because of many reasons like athletics or extracurricular activities. If cell phones are banned from the school, students that are members of teams or clubs might need to call their parents to tell them what time to pick them up or even to tell a parent or guardian that they have a game or meeting after school.

If students have a study hall then I think they should be able to have their cell phones. Many students just roam the hallways during their study halls. It would be just as beneficial to have them sitting at a table texting or checking their e-mail online.

Lunch periods are a time for students to talk to their friends. If they could have a cell phone during that time they could talk to other friends from different schools. They could also be available to call a parent to ask for lunch money or a project they forgot at home.

There are many benefits to having cell phones during students' free time or lunch period. It is important to kids to stay in touch with all of their friends and if cell phones were available, they could do that. I do not think that having cell phones in certain times of the day would distract students from their studies. I think it would just give them a time to take a break from studies for a few minutes. It would help them focus more on their schoolwork during class instead of wondering how many new text messages they have received. I hope this letter has made an impact on your decision. Thank you.

"First impressions are very important because that is the way people know you. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change and I agree with that statement, because it is hard to change people's mind and the way they think about you.

When someone know you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. Sometimes when you tell them you are a different person, they won't give you a chance to demostrate if is true, and they will just keep the idea they already have. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change.

Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. Then they just keep their distance or go away and you can not do anything to change their opinion. First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearence or the way you act.

Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who thinks that it is not hard to change first impressions , and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions.

To conclude first impressions are almost impossible to change and people should be more carefully about first impressions. Because it is very hard to change the way a person thinks. and also it can affect your reputation.",0
" In today's world, individuals have their own opinions and make their own decisions. However, this has led to a significant shift in the way people approach decision-making. People are now more intelligent and make wise decisions on a daily basis. However, they often take risks without consulting experts or authorities.

It is crucial for individuals to seek guidance from experts and authorities when making significant decisions. This will make it easier for them to choose the best options, as they will have someone who already knows about it. People often make wrong decisions when they make decisions on their own. Celebrities, for example, have personal managers who make thoughtful decisions for them to keep them on track with their careers. If celebrities were to make their own decisions, many of them would likely fail in their careers.

The decisions people make should be thoughtful and well-informed. Seeking guidance from experts is essential to ensure that the decisions made are the best possible ones. For instance, Christopher from Into the Wild is a prime example of the dangers of not seeking advice. He went into the wilderness of Alaska alone without any guidance or preparation, which ultimately led to his death. If he had sought advice from experts, he would have had a better chance of survival.

People who seek advice from experts and authorities are more likely to have a successful life. While there are some individuals who have achieved success in their careers by making their own decisions, most people need guidance from experts to keep them on track. Seeking advice from experts is more reliable than making decisions on one's own, as it reduces the likelihood of making wrong decisions.

In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities is crucial when making significant decisions. It ensures that the decisions made are well-informed and thoughtful, reducing the likelihood of making wrong decisions. People who seek advice are more likely to have a successful life and career, while those who make decisions on their own are more likely to fail.",1
"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or choice can help someone make a better, more well-informed selection for a few key reasons:

Firstly, getting perspectives from different people exposes you to a wider range of ideas, considerations, and potential outcomes you may not have otherwise thought of on your own. No single person can possibly anticipate every aspect or implication related to a complex choice, but pooling various viewpoints collectively increases the chances of canvassing more complete information. 

Secondly, distinct individuals often have complementary strengths, backgrounds, and ways of thinking. Whereas one may focus more on analytical factors, another on emotions or personal anecdotes. Still another could contribute practical knowledge from relevant similar past experiences. Together, a diversity of opinions balances out and compensates for individual limitations or blind spots. 

Thirdly, consistency across multiple recommendations increases confidence that a particular option has true merit rather than just seeming best to one source alone. If completely independent people converge on the same advice after examining a situation through their own lenses, that advice is more likely to be sound. Convergence also reduces the influence of any one person's potential biases. 

Finally, hearing alternatives to the initial choice you were leaning towards challenges your assumptions and prevents becoming rigidly set on one path without due consideration of others. Other viewpoints force subjective weighing of pros and cons rather than passive acceptance of your preconceptions. They make what may seem like an obvious decision actually weigh all factors objectively. 

In sum, soliciting opinions from more than one trusted source expands the information pool, brings different valuable perspectives, establishes convergent lines of support, and helps test your ideas rather than simply confirm them. A decision guided by multiple trusted counselors is likely to enjoy better chances of true success than one based on limited or biased standalone perspectives alone.",1
"Science Experiment Report

Introduction:

As an 8th-grade student, I recently completed a science experiment with my group. Our goal was to investigate the effects of different types of fertilizers on plant growth. We chose this experiment because we were interested in understanding how plants grow and how different nutrients can affect their growth.

Experiment Design:

We decided to conduct a controlled experiment with three different types of fertilizers: organic, chemical, and a control group with no fertilizer. We planted three seeds of the same plant species in each group of three pots. We used the same amount of soil, water, and light for each group. We then applied the fertilizer to each group according to the instructions on the package.

Task Assignment:

Each member of the group was assigned a different task. One person was responsible for planting the seeds, another person was responsible for watering the plants, and the third person was responsible for recording the growth of the plants.

Supply and Materials:

We gathered the following supplies and materials for the experiment:

* Three types of fertilizer (organic, chemical, and a control group with no fertilizer)
* Three pots
* Soil
* Seeds of the same plant species
* Water
* Light source
* Ruler
* Notebook and pen for recording growth

Experiment Execution:

We followed the instructions carefully and made sure that each group received the same amount of soil, water, and light. We applied the fertilizer to each group according to the instructions on the package. We then watered the plants and placed them in a light source. We recorded the growth of the plants every week using a ruler.

Discussion and Reflection:

After the experiment was completed, we discussed the results as a group. We noticed that the plants in the organic fertilizer group grew the fastest, followed by the chemical fertilizer group, and the control group with no fertilizer grew the slowest. We also noticed that the plants in the organic fertilizer group had the healthiest appearance, with green leaves and strong stems.

We reflected on the process and outcomes of the experiment. We learned that different types of fertilizers can have different effects on plant growth. We also learned the importance of",1
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects, so the students continue to learn during their break. Critics might say that these summer projects should be designed by students because they understand what the students will be doing during summer break. These summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers know what the students will be learning after their summer break is over, teachers have more knowledge than students, and students will make the project as easy as possible.

Teachers should be designing these summer projects because they know what the students will be learning after summer break. This will be more beneficial for the students because the teacher can design the project that mainly focuses on material that will be crucial for the students when summer break ends. For example, if a student needs to know the fundamentals of Algebra 1, the teacher can add Algebra 1 basics onto the project that way after the break, the students know the material and the teacher will not have to spend a lot of class time reviewing. This not only helps the students, but also helps the teachers too since they can spend more time on new material rather than reviewing old material. The teacher could also include problems from next years course to give the students a little taste of what is to come.

The next reason as to why the summer projects should be designed by teachers is because the teachers have more knowledge than the students. The teachers having more knowledge about their subject and life in general is super helpful for the students when it comes to designing the project. If a student were to design the project it could possibly be a huge mess compared to if a teacher designed it because the teacher has done many projects before they became a teacher. This is very important because the teacher knows what kinds of projects are successful and which ones are a complete mess. The teacher can design it so it is easy to read and easy to do for the student.

Lastly, it would be better for a teacher to design the project because the students would try to make it as easy as possible. Since students want to have as little work as possible during their break, they will try to make the project very easy to do; however, if a teacher were to make the project they would make sure that it is not too easy, but also not too hard for the student. This is important because if it was too easy the student would not learn much over the break. For example, a student who got a student-designed project that was super easy might struggle when they come back from break because they did not learn anything since it was too easy. However, a student that got a teacher-designed project that was a bit challenging would have a much easier time when they come back from break compared to the one that got the easy student-designed project.

In conclusion, a teacher-designed project is more beneficial than a student designed project because teachers know what the students will be learning after their summer break ends, teachers have more knowledge than students, and students will try to make the project as easy as possible.",0
"Hey, so I'm gonna write this essay about imagination vs knowledge and stuff. I think it's pretty cool that we get to talk about what Albert Einstein thinks 'cause he's like, super smart and all.

So, Einstein thinks that knowledge is more important than imagination. He thinks that knowledge is what helps us understand the world and make new discoveries, and that imagination is just something that we use to make up stories and stuff. But I don't totally agree with him.

I think that imagination is pretty darn important too! Like, without imagination, we wouldn't have all the cool technologies and stuff that we have today. Think about it, like, if someone didn't imagine what a smartphone would be like, we wouldn't have them! And they're like, super useful and stuff.

But on the other hand, knowledge is pretty cool too. Like, without knowledge, we wouldn't know how to use all the cool technologies that we have. And it's not just that, knowledge helps us understand the world and how it works, and that's pretty cool too.

So, I think that both imagination and knowledge are important in their own ways. Like, they're both super valuable and stuff. Imagination helps us come up with new ideas and make new things, but knowledge helps us understand how to use those things and make them real.

For example, like, if you're trying to invent a new type of car, you need to use your imagination to come up with the idea of what it would look like and how it would work. But then you need to use your knowledge to figure out how to make it real and stuff.

And another example is like, if you're trying to understand a new topic in school, you need to use your knowledge to learn about it and understand it. But then you can use your imagination to think of new ways to use that knowledge and make it useful.

So yeah, I think that imagination and knowledge are both important, and they work together to make us smarter and more creative and stuff. And that's pretty cool!",1
"During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education.

When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students.

A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project.

In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses.

Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.",0
"If you need advice you should ask someone. Or maybe you should ask more than one person. Have you ever though about it if you ask for advice from one person their opinion might be different than someone else. If you ask one person they will say their opinion but maybe someone else has their own opinion. you should ask more than one person so you can get a better idea of what everyone is thinking about it not what one person is thinking about. It is crazy how you can have so many opinions or just one would you rather have advice from one person or advice from many to see what the most popular choice is.

Ask a friend a family member anyone you trust enough to give you advice. Siblings and parents give some of the best advice. Why,because they know you better than anyone else they can help you in pretty much any situation. Getting advice might be hard but you just need to believe in it and give it a try. Just be brave and ask a close friend parents siblings trust in yourself and trust in advice

I once tried to do something but i didnt know if I could. So I asked a few of my friends one of my friends said no. two more of my friends said no but then one of my friends since I was kid came up and said yes and my brother said yes. That was when I decided that my close friends and family give me better advice than my new friends. I tried what my friends said I couldn't do and I did it only because my family and close friends gave me good advice.

So even if you can get great advice from one person try to get a group of advice to find out the best idea. if you wanted to rob a bank would you get one friend that says yeah sure or would you want fifty of your other friends saying no. That is an example of good advice taking asking many people for advice instead of one or two. you will have a higher chance of coming out better with more advice advice than one or two people. if some random kid said I bet you wont jump into the river and you ask all of your family and they say dont, who's advice would you take?",0
"Throughout Americas history, people have always owned cars. They use them to travel into the city or long distances. But now it looks as if the tides may be turning for automobiles. Studies have shown that car ownership and average miles driven by citizens have decreased dramatically in the past ten years. Not only is the the case for the United States, but all around the world.

Cars every year release emissions that are harmful to the enviroment. The emissions pollute crowded cities, which makes it dangerous for citizens to live there. In Paris, days of near-record pollutuion made the city partially ban driving for two days. Even number license plates wouldn't drive on one chosen day and odd numbered the next. If the citzens did not comply to this, they were fined twenty two euros. Four thousand drivers had to pay that fine for not leaving their vehicles at home. The other citizens that did comply with the city helped dramtically reduce the smog in Paris. And during the partial driving ban, congestion was down nearly sixty percent.

The decrease in automobile use is not only being used to decrease pollution, people also say that not driving a vehicle helps reduce stress. Heidrun Walter of Vauban, Germany said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". She lives in Germany's experimental suburb that is ""car free"". Automobiles are not banned in this area, per say. But if you want to own a vehicle in this neighborhood, you must buy a parking spot for 40,000 dollars and a home. This neighboorhood is helping shape the way for a future wihtout cars.

One of the main benefits that would directly improve the qaulity of life for humans by decreasing car usage would be exercise. Obesity in the world, especially in America, has been an evergrowing problem in the past twenty years. People have become so busy in their lives where exercise is not one of their top priorities. Without the use of automobiles, citizens would have to either walk, bike, skate, or jog to their destination. This way they would exercise while traveling, wherever that may be.

Overall, the world is preparing for an inspirational future without cars. This would help the world in many areas like Paris or Hong Kong for decreasing pollution or help America with the battle against obesity. No one can predict the future, whether it contains automobiles or not. But the world is certainly becoming less dependant on them, who knows, one day they may become obsolete.    ",0
"Yes I am with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions.

I am with it because it would get to know the students better and make them into a better person. It could also help you be on task more and not be distracted by the little things you see.

I see it could help from these evidence in the artical because right here it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". In that sentance it is saying that a classroom computer is knowing when a student is confused or bored I think if a computer knew exactly when that was I think it would be pretty cool. Going into the computer and the computer knowing what you are and who you are and how you deal with your life is pretty rare to do.

Another way I strongly agree on is for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there face right?

of course but image a computer doing the same thing. Dr. haung ovserves that artist such as da vinci studied a human anantomy to hlep them paint facial muscles precisely enought to convey the most important emotions. Others think on how you feel the first day is how you will feel the 2nd day and then its just gonna keep going until you need or get help. What if somebody was getting mentily abused from somebody cruel and rude and they did not say anything to anyone. Well thats why we got the computer to help us out and it would tell us how it really felt on who they are.

Helping others out could really benefit somebodys life in alot of ways. Techology would really need more and more advice from other companys. in paragraph 3 it says "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Im that sentace it is talking about more of the muscles than computers.

Then test on the humans to see if they are showing ""emotional expressions"". You may be able to test there musscles and if they are hard and twich alot it shows that they are lieing or if they just relax and let it go through like you should it would show the truth.

A conclution of this is that my opinion i think we should have it around earth because I think we as people need to help others if they are having bad problems with there lives so thats why we need the computer to test them out and see how they are doing with it. Dr Paul Echman has classified six basic emotions of happiness , suprise , anger , disgust , fear or sadness and this computer could tell you what you are if you would do the test. ",0

Here are some other things like we should be coming to school to get are education and not play around like during on are own time then we can like lunch and outside. But when we are in the class room we need to stay focus and keep are grades up. TEACHER_NAME, 'What I'm saying is that I understand that you want are students to have good grades. If they have a grade C average you shouldn't take school activities and sports away because they don't have a grade B average just tell them that they need to keep there grade up. If it goes down to a D or a F then they shouldn't be in activities because they need to be focus on there school work first before they are in school activities and sports. That's what I'm talking about I understand if they have a D or a F but a grade C average they just need to keep it up to a C or a B average and a

A that would even be better.

Here is my writing response, My principal TEACHER_NAME is considering changing school policy so that students like me and other students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have at least a grade B average. Most of the students here have a grade C average.",0
"Would you ever consider giving up your car? No, well you probably should since it seems to be the trend these days, and there's seemingly countless advantages of limiting car usage. Acording to The End of Car Culture, we hit our driving peak in 2005, and the amount of miles driven has been going down steadily. There has also been a large drop in how many 16- to 39-year-olds are getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age as was stated in Mr. Sivak's research.

With the amount of car usage going down other things are taking place and helping shape our future, as Mimi Sheller says, ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift. As said in The End of Car Culture, Instead of driving to meet and talk to people, we have the internet that makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected, unlike the tense, stressed feelings cars give you as shown with Heidrun Walters response to having gotten rid of his car, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Cars dont only create stress, they also produce large amounts of smog. As stated in the article, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, up to 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions are caused by passenger cars. All of the smog is destroying the ozone layer and causing major problems such as global warming.

Limiting car usage can be a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, as Carlos Arturo Plaza says. Cars not only destroy the health of your enviroment by doing damage to the air around you, they also do damage to your brain and cause you to stress and feel tense over imaginary things.                            ",0
"The Facial Action Coding System technology that let you reads emotional expressions of students. I strongly disagree with this statement because emtions is not some that you can just get a computer software to scan you to let you know if your happy or sad. How can a computer just express how humans feel emotions are some you feel when another person tell you that you are speacial, and not by letting a computer tell you. Computers are program to do what you wan them to do and help with things such as homework, research pappers and essays they are a software system bulit to help you with over the site needs.

Dr. haung and his collegue are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. I feel like you can't just program a computer to pick what emotions you think students are feeling,a and what if the software system was wrong and thats not what the student was feeling. Emotions are a feeling you get when you feel like you don't have a care in the world , or when that special someone makes you happy because they smiled at you those are emtions they are inside you not on a machine that was bulit by man to tell you how you feel.

And in my conclusion the facial expressions for each emoion are univeral oberves,and even though individuals show varying degress of expressions. Each student have the own facial expression is compared aginst a neutral face showing no emotion in a student face. A machine that will let you know if a student is borde or confused is good but that's why we have are own voice to let our teacher know that we need help.",0
"Near the French and Swiss bordars a new district on the outskirts of Freiburg streetparking ,driveways,and home garges are fobidden . A person that would like a car would have to pay 40,000 for a parking space ,along with a home . 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent of them sold there car to move down here .

This could be a growing trend to seperate suburban life from auto use as a movement called ""smart planning "". Which could help in the future .

Not driving can clean up the air for the global city and wont take to much pollution in Paris . In paris people with any kind of veichle that contains a motor with evan -numbered license plates had to levae their cars at home or have to deal with a 22-euro fine . It would apply the next day to the odd-number license plates too. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined . People would have their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine . Congestion was down 60 percent in Frence ,after five days of intensifying smog it started to trap car emissions .

In bogota they had a big hit with car-free day .It was three straight year when cars got banned. With only buses and taxis were premitted for the day without cars .

Recent studies show that Americans have been buying lesser cars driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by .

A study showed that less then 23 percent of youmg people decreased.

In conculsion these are my examples of advantages of limiting driving .    ",0
"Some people like boat trips. Some people don't like them. For the people who like boat trips you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One reason to join this program is because you have so much fun! On my first trip I thought the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for me. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was really special. Also taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Another reason why you should join this program is because you get a chance to help people. The Seagoing Cowboys is about helping people with what they need. I went just after World War ll ended. A lot of small towns and cities were ruined from the war and needed help on getting their farming equipment. We were on a cattle-boat that had about 335 horses plus oats and hay to feed them. We had a lot more animals on our ship.

Some of the bad things about joining this program is the hard work and danger. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day at least. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship and stalls had to be cleaned. But the worst part about joining this program is the danger. When I joined this program I cracked a couple of ribs. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, when I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. I was happy to be alive, but I could not work for a couple of days.

No madder if you like boat trips or not you should join this program. Don't think about yourself. Just remember, the best thing about this trip is that you will always be happy when you think about all the lives you saved and helped by joining the Seagoing Cowboys!  ",0
"Thomas Jefferson said. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament. Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related.

However noeveryone agree. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. But he always said this words ""one day everything is going to change."" He never stop to belived that. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something ""I need to struggle.""

Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. But you can get all this if you work hard and. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things

Finally, be related everyday this is something special. Because you always are looking for something more than one. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen.

In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live.",0
"Ah, the electoral college. Don't you just how irrelevant, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency Source 2. Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce Source 2, and abolish the electoral college.

First, and most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors Source 1. This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" Source 2. If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win Sources 1 and 3. Voters for the electoral college say that people in the swing states are going to pay closer attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters Source 3, but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?!

The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. If this is to occur, then state delegates in the House of representatives decide the President Source 2. Each state only casts one vote, so the representative from Rhode Island would have just as much to say as the 55 representatives from the state of California Source 1 and 2. Not only that, but a majority of people vote one party for president and another for Congress Source 3. There are 538 possible votes in the electoral college Source 1, so it isn't impossible for a tie to happen. In 1976, if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had switched candidates, there would have been a tie Source 2.

And finally, the last thing that makes the electoral college as relevant as a new wheel for your horse and buggy is that, it's mindboggling confusing. The electoral college is run by humans, so we must account for human error. The electors are just people chosen by the candidate who don't hold a seat in government Sources 1 and 2. In 1960, a group of racists in Louisiana almost replaced Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, and he would have lost the election Source 2. In Hawaii, also in 1960, two slates of electors were sent Source 3. Faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for anyone else Source 2.

In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.",0
"Our home called Earth will not last forever. In thousands of years to come we will need a new home if we want humans to survive. The author in the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has given us a possibility of a new home.

Venus is known to be Earth's twin. Earth and Venus has similarities but also differences. Scientist and inventors can help make us adapt to Venus's enviroment. Venus has many harsh living enviroments like average temperatures being over eight hundard degrees fahrenheit, atmospheric pressure is ninty times greater than Earth, hottest surface temperature, and even intense weather. None of these dangers can stop us entirely. Venus may have some harsh conditions but us humans can survive if we put effort into it. The author has provided information about how we can adapt to Venus's lifestyle. He has done research about past inventions from world war II that could help us with inventions that could survive the intense heat and also many other ideas.

Not only do scientists believe this could happen but even NASA. NASA has came up with a solution to be able to create hostile conditions, so us humans can survive on the hot surfaces on Venus. If scientist and NASA continue to do their job and commit to Venus then humans will never have to be scared of us humans loosing our home. It may not be our generations but many generations to come will thank these people who have put thier time, effort, and brains to help make Venus our second home.

Dedication and Imagination can lead us to the Evening Star.

All we need is to be brave and try new things. The author has shown us a new way to live and proved to the readers we can make it happen. I'll be hoping to see you on the spaceship to Venus, our new home.          ",0
"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research how having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. And honestly, it's pretty cool how it works. So, like, when you have multiple opinions, it's like having different perspectives on something. And those perspectives can either support or go against your choice. It's like, if you're trying to decide where to go for spring break, and your friend thinks Hawaii is the best place ever, but your other friend is like, ""Ugh, don't go there, it's so crowded and hot."" So, you're like, ""Okay, well, maybe I shouldn't go to Hawaii then."" See what I mean?

But it's not just about considering other people's opinions. Having different opinions can also help you think of a better choice. Like, if you're trying to decide what to wear to a party, and your sister is like, ""You should wear that cool new shirt you got,"" but your mom is like, ""You should wear something more conservative,"" you're like, ""Hmm, maybe I should wear something in between."" You know? So, it's not just about picking one option, it's about considering all the options and finding the best one.

And then there's advice from close ones. Like, if you're trying to decide what college to go to, and your parents are like, ""You should go to state U,"" but your best friend is like, ""You should go to private U,"" you're like, ""Okay, well, maybe I should consider both."" It's like, having people you trust give you their input can help you make a better decision.

So, in conclusion, having multiple opinions can really help you make a better choice. It's like, having different perspectives and advice can help you think of something that you might not have thought of on your own. And it's not just about picking one option, it's about considering all the options and finding the best one. Cool, right?",1
"I think they should make driverless cars but not all of them should be driverless they should just make some.

There is alot of people that would like to have one.

They would help alot for people that can't drive so they would be way more helpful and i think there will be less car crashes.

"Limiting car usage will have many advantages. Not only will it reduce pollution ,but it will also encourage a more healthy lifestyle. Also limiting car usage may help ween us off of our dependence on foreign oil. Car usage has caused a lot of problems economically, environmentally, and physically for the United States.

To start off, car usage is very bad for our environment. The number one cause of air pollution in the U.S. is transportation. So, if we found a cleaner and more environmentallyfriendly way of transportation that help a lot. One way would be to reduce car usage. It would be much better if once or twice a week people would ride their bike or walk to work or where ever they are going. I understand that some people live to far away from where ever they are going to ride a bike or walk ,but if you carpool with people who are also going to the same place you save on gas money and you will also be helping the environment.

In addition to helping the environment, limiting car usage will also promote a healthier life style. With the united state's obesity rates skyrocketing we could use all the healthy lifestyle promoting we can get. By limiting car usage we can encourage people to walk and bike to where ever they are going. Which will influence people to add a little exercise into their daily routine.

Along with promoting a healthier lifestyle, limiting car usage can also help the U.S. without major problem. Over the years the U.S. has had many great presidents,but almost all of them have promised the same thing, that they will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But nothing has happened. I believe that limiting car usage will help us in reducing the United states dependence on foreign oil because if we aren't driving our cars as often we won't need as much oil.

In conclusion, the advantages to limiting car usage are that it will reduce pollution, promote a healthier lifestyle, and it will reduce our dependence on foreign oil.",0
"In the modern world, we are almost completely dependent on our technology to get us through the day. These human creations, such as, cellular phones, the internet, computers, and cars make it easier for us to perform everyday tasks. But for such heavy use of these items, there are side effects. Cars in particular can, and will, create lasting issues in our environment, which if not resolved will cause many problems in our future. But there is hope if the First World states like the UK, France, Germany, and the U.S. were to cut down on car usage, we would see a drastic decline in not only the air polluting greenhouse gases, but also expenses for families spending all their money at a gas pump. Furthermore, we would see an increase in other things, such as the amount of exercise and public people would acquire through alternative transportation.

The foremost issue is of course, the environmental effects of cars. According to the New York times, cars are on average responsible for ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas"". These emissions can often make cities uninhabitable. In places such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other urban centers heavy pollution requires citizens to wear gas masks, and acid rain devastates plant life. This heavy pollution has such an effect that it causes black snow in Russia, thousands of miles away. But the scale of the problem is much larger than acid rains and black snow our planet is heating up, and greenhouse gases are to blame. If you want evidence just look at our neighbor, Venus. Roughly the size of Earth, scientists believe that Venus once has water, but look at it today, and you will see our solar system's hottest planet. Several million years ago Venus was overcome by volcanic activity of much greater extent than anything ever seen on Earth since it's formation in precambrian time. These volcanos spewed thousands of tons of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, and thus began the greenhouse effect. The sun's rays would pierce through the smog and reflect off of the surface of the planet, but when they went back up the smog stopped them and turned them away, back down towards the planet's surface. This caused the planet to practically absorb all of the energy and heat of the sun. Before long the surface temperature became hot enough to melt lead, making Venus utterly uninhabitable. If nothing is done to stop atmospheric pollution, this is our future.

But in our modern world many people would be completely lost without a car, it has become the staple of our infastructure, not unlike the horse from years past. But there is evidence in the small town of Vauban, Germany that life without cars is a very possible thing. The small community of Vauban has forbidden cars within their town, and the results are suprisingly positive. Of the residents of Vauban, seventy percent do not own cars, and are very happy with their circumstances. As Heidrun Walter said to the New York Times, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" While other states might not have such successful car free zone's, Colombia has an annual carfree day in their capital of Bogota and surrounding cities. This day often has millions of Colombians biking, and walking from place to place. There has also been an improvement in city beautification according to an article by the Seattle Times, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Not only does the restriction of cars help the environment, it can also help the economy.

The average American citizen's budget consists mainly of two things, housing, and vehicles. But during the recession of 2008, there was a decline of about nine percent in average miles driven. The burden of gas prices and car payments became too much for many unemployed Americans. But after the recession passed, the decline continued, and may soon accelerate. The New York Time states that ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age"". If this trend continues, then we have already taken the first step in curbing our greenhouse gas emissions and by doing so, we may increase the living standards of our citizens who would have more money. As well as repurposed government funding in other cleaner and faster forms of transportation due to a lesser need in road construction and maintainance.

Finally, the world we live in today is changing, and with always increasing technology, it may not be long before a clean alternative to gas burning vehicles arises. But you cannot count on the unknown and what is known is that should we continue on our current path, the world will be a very hot place by 2040. Either we must change, or our cars will die with us.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in presidential elections. While many argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves several crucial functions that ensure fairness, certainty, and representation in our democratic process.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system employed by most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide victory in terms of electoral votes. Despite its occasional disputes, the Electoral College has a proven track record of producing a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes. This avoids the complications and uncertainty that may arise from a direct popular vote, where a dispute over the outcome is more likely.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the president is a representative for all regions of the country. This system requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal and prevents a candidate with solely regional support from winning the presidency. As a result, residents from all regions feel that their votes count and that the elected president will consider their interests. This is crucial for maintaining national unity and preventing the disenfranchisement of certain groups of voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College directs campaign efforts towards swing states. This focus on swing states generates engagement and attention from the most thoughtful voters, as they are aware that their vote may sway the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to address the concerns and needs of these voters, resulting in a more informed electorate and a candidate who has a comprehensive understanding of the diverse needs of the nation.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its ability to give a fair weight to both large and small states. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate may lead to political imbalances, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive greater attention from candidates during campaigns. This grants citizens in larger states a sense of significance and influence in the election process, ultimately giving them a voice in electing the president.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process and prolong the decision-making time. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes to win the presidency, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This streamlines the election process and avoids the costly and time-consuming efforts of organizing run-off elections.

Despite criticism from its opponents, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system. It ensures certainty, representation, and fairness in presidential elections, while also allowing small and swing states to have a substantial say in the outcome. While there may be room for reforms within the Electoral College, abolishing it altogether would undermine the principles of our Constitution and erode the delicate balance of power among states.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will take my views into account when evaluating potential changes to the electoral process. Our democracy depends on a fair and effective system for electing our president, and I believe that the Electoral College continues to fulfill this role admirably.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear: Principal

I have written this letter to inform you that many students at this school have a C average. Many students that do in fact have a C average have complained about not being able to participate in sports or other activities. I highly suggest that you change the minimum requirement to a C average. Some students might not be able to score higher than a C average. And you may not agree with me on this, but some of the students may not get higher then a C average because of their home environment. Setting the minimum to a B average might encourage the students that currently have a C average to try harder in their classes, but some of the students might not try harder in class just because of this.

You could set the minimum to a C average and promote that the students try harder. You could even award the students that go to a B average from a C average with prizes(this could encourage others that still have a C average to improve). Their are other positive things that could be don along with changing the minimum to a C average. To offer more advise, you could brainstorm with the physical education teachers to come up with a plan on how to encourage the students that even though the minimum is a C average they should still try hard to do well in their classes(supposing that you change the minimum to a C average).

Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely: 8th grade student            ",0
"The student body election was being held next week, and Generic_Name was anxious. She couldn't decide if she wanted to run or not, because she thought she wouldn't be good enough. She asked her friends, her parents, and even her older sister who was the vice president a few years back. They all gave her the same answer, and that answer was yes. The week of the election, Generic_Name raised her hand to be a candidate. Another girl name Generic_Name raised her hand as well. Anxiety swelled inside her. Generic_Name had better grades, was more athletic, and was in all honors classes. What if she wasn't chosen? After an agonizing two weeks, the results came. Generic_Name had been elected to be the student body president! Just like Generic_Name, people hold themselves back from such great opportunities. People tend to self doubt, have no confidence in their selves, and argue continually whether they should do it or not until it's too late. Seeking the advice of others will help people make the right choices, receive advice from people with more experience, and have no self doubt.

Every action a person makes leads up to making a choice. Now, will it be a good choice, or a bad choice? It's up to that person to decide. People have a hard time making the right choice, like whether they should do their homework on time, join that club, be friends with those people, or even just debating whether they should take out the trash or not. They often have their own opinion, or just can't make up their minds at all. That's when asking someone else for advice comes in. Someone else always has a different perspective, and can see things the other person can't. That one person can help the other person realize what they should do. A person's friend could be telling them to join this friend group, although that person knows those people aren't the right friends for them. Asking another friend, or a guardian can help them clear that up and make the right decision.

When it comes to advice, people tend to ask their friends first. It's not a bad thing for people to ask their friends, but what about someone who's older and wiser than them? People who are older, like their grand parents for example, have been through more than them and will be able to help that person in need by giving them wiser advice. Another option is their parents. People's parents are the people who know that person the best, and knows what they need to succeed. Someone else they should consider is an older sibling who might've been in the same place that person has, and has great advice to offer to them. Teachers are a great choice too, for they are the ones who see that person every day at school, and knows what's best for them. If that person isn't in a school, perhaps they can ask their boss or colleagues who have worked far longer than they have. These people are sure to have words of wisdom that's worth listening to.

Finally, people have have self doubt. It's the feeling of whether they should try out for the team, enter that competition, audition for that play, etc. They are digging a hole deeper, and deeper of self doubt, and by the time they make up their mind to do it, they are stuck in the whole they made themselves. But someone can help them get out with a few simple words. 'You can do it.' 'You got this'. That causes a spark of hope that lights inside them, and that spark becomes a flame, and that flame becomes a raging fire that engulfs them in positive energy. Just asking a person and letting them tell the other a few encouraging words means a big difference to them. If the person never even asked at all, then they would be stuck all alone swallowed up in their own darkness, and self doubt, and what person would want that?

To sum it all up, asking other people for advice will help that person see what the right decision is, have wiser advice to assist them in making a choice, and have no clouded judgment against their self. They should stop thinking that they are right even though someone else other than them knows that whatever they think it wrong. That person right next to them could have some great advice to offer if they asked. People are never going to stop having problems on making up their minds, but asking another person for advice is something people should all do.",0
"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are.

Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldn't get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude.

Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didn't like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didn't want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didn't take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldn't because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you don't know them.

First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are.

Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change.

Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think it's a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change.

In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",0
"Mooo!

Horses, young cows, and mules are interesting mammels.

Luke Bomberger went on a adventer were he could watch these animals.

He also got to go to Europe and China. Dosen't that sound fun? This paper is about the adventer Luke took. There are many other good parts about taking this trip.

Luke had a oppertunity of a lifetime when he signed up to be a Seagoing Cowboy. First he got to see the acropolis. Then he got to ride on a gondola to see Venice, Italy. He said he had the time of his life. He also liked watching the animals.

If you like animals you get to take care of them in a boat or water vessle to Europe or Asia.

Some of the animals need help. There also other fun things to do like tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, baseball, and volleyball.

If you like trips, sports and animals you would be perfect to be a Seagoing Cowboy. A lot of animals need help.

You can help them by being a Seagoing Cowboy.

You can have fun too taking a trip or playing sports. Sign up now!      ",0
"Do you want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? My name is Luke and I did the program and I had a blast. The Seagoing Cowboys progam takes you places unique around the world. If you want to know more about the Seagoing Cowboys keep reading and learn what the progam is about.

One reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys is to get to see new places you have never seen. The Seagoing Cowboys is the best to know, when you want to visit a place. If you would join maybe they just happen to go where you want to see or visit. I went to nine trips before I was discharged in nine-teen forty-seven. You can go on multiply rides before you get discharged.

The second reason is, so you can be open to new places. Some people have lived one area their whole life and have never been many places. If they had to move they would not know some things were in the area they where going. The Seagoing Cowboys takes you different places, so you are not in one area your whole life. If you never met some animals then maybe you would get to meet them and even be able to take care of them if you join the Seagoing Cowboys.

The third reason is to learn more about Earth. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys you would learn a lot more about Earth and the places that are on Earth. When you get know more about Earth then you become smarter and know more about whaat can happen. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps you learn a lot more about animals and wildlife. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you can definitely be like me and make nine trips and learn something new everytime. If you can not take that many trips you still can enjoy it and learn.

I think overall it is that I had a great time. I think you should join and then maybe you will have as much fun as me. If you join then you will have to learn about animals and learn how to take care of them. If you do join Seagoing Cowboys make it useful, and help you learn more about the Earth, be open about Earth, and see new places. If you want to learn more about these things then you need to join Seagoing Cowboys.",0
"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is writes mostly in favor of driverless cars but adds some valid points as to why these cars may not be the best decision. I believe that the latter opinion is the logical stance. If completely driverless cars were to exsist in the furture the human race would lose one more skill due to technology. On top of this loss of skill there runs the risk of computer malfuntion within the car, legal issues if and when these cars get into an accident, and people attempting to hack the cars' computer system in an attempt to kill someone.

If these are created into exsistence then people will no longer posses the abilily to drive their own car. While this may seem like a good thing these cars will not be able to do everything a human typically can do in avoiding an accident. When a situation occurs that there may be an accident there may be an opportunity for the ""driver"" to take over. Unfortunatly, this will be pointless because these ""drivers"" will no longer know how to control their own cars.

Furthermore, if and when this accident happens, who will take the blame for its cause. Will it be the drivers fault, the car's fault, or the manufacturers fault?

This is a point that is brought up in paragraph 9, ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault -the driver or the manufacturer?"" A whole new set of laws will be needed in order to accomadate this new type of car. Even if new laws are created for these cars and it is made easier to have someone take the blame for an accident how will anyone know if it is truly their fault?

Besides the loss of skill and the legal issues for if and when these cars malfuntion, there is also an issue of these cars being easily hacked. It is getting easier and easier for people to acces sensitve information with everything thing being placed online and creating these cars is just adding another thing to be hacked. It is a very real possiblies that someone may hack into a world leaders car and try to crash it in an attempt at an assination. If this does happen the public would no longer be able to feel safe in even our cars and would be at the mercy of these online hackers.

I believe that, while having driverless cars would be an amazing feat in humankind's technological advancement, there are too many risks involved if these cars are created. We would be losing another skill to technology, computers malfunction on occasion and when one of these car's computer malfuntions and causes a crash who will take the balme, and people with these cars will be putting there lives in the hands of these compurters and the people with the skill to hack and control these computers. It is too dangerous to have these cars and have everyone using them.    ",0
"Many schools have begun to offer distance learning as a way for students to attend classes from home by using online resources and video conferences. These online classes offer more ways for students to learn, and they are a more accessible option for many parents and students. In this day and age, many students participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports, volunteer work, clubs, etc. with all of these activities going on in an average student's life, they lose time for both homework and their friends. Distance learning programs can help fix this problem by allowing students to learn on their own schedule and not having to travel so much between school and their other activities.

Students would benefit from distance learning, as it would help students manage their time more effectively and leave more time for other activities.

As a student, I participate in a few extracurricular activities, it is practically a necessity to get into a good college these days. I play two different sports and work a job at a local fast food chain, between practice and work, I typically only have a 1-2 hours a day to focus on anything other than school, work, or practice. On days where I have a sports game or an important test to prepare for, those 1-2 hours are non-existent. I am one of many students who experience this problem, and I believe distance learning can help combat this issue. With distance learning, I won't have to waste an hour or two of my day by traveling between school and my other activities. Plus, maintaining a good sleep schedule would be much easier, as more time would be available to sleep, therefore making it easier to learn by not being so tired constantly. Simply put, by offering distance learning, managing time and sleep becomes much easier to do, and with that come the benefits of being more focused when it is time to learn.

Distance learning also allows students to set a manageable schedule of their learning. In the current classroom environment, everyone has to go at the same pace as everyone else. If the subject comes very easy to an individual, than he will quickly find himself bored and tired in that class. On the other hand, if it is a very difficult subject for him, he won't be able to comprehend the important concepts in the same time frame of a student who is good at that subject. With prerecorded lectures and the ability to schedule as many classes as one thinks they need on a subject, students can set their own pace for learning and learn a lot more effectively. It is extremely important that everyone gets an education, but some may need more time or help than others, distance learning is part of the solution to this problem.

Some people may argue that students can not be trusted with the ability to set there own schedule and that many will just stop scheduling classes and learning all together. I disagree, many students hate coming to school, but will still skip classes even knowing the consequences that it will bring in the future. It is because some students dread coming to school so much that distance learning would work for them. With the help of a counselor to help work out an effective plan for learning, kids won't dread school so much, because they can now learn from home in a comfortable environment at their own pace.

That is why distance learning is a great program that should be encouraged throughout school systems. It allows students to manage their time much easier, provides better pacing for learning, and creates a comfortable environment for students. Some may abuse the ability of not having to actually show up at a designated location for class, but students skip class anyways in a regular classroom environment, and distance learning will help reduce that problem if anything. That is why I believe it is a good idea for all schools to start assimilating distance learning, at least to some extent, into their education systems.",0
"Goals are a vital key to most individuals life, whether they are a teenager, child, adult, or student. Ones goal may be to ace a test, anothers may be to pay off past student loans. Specifically, a teenagers goal may be to take the formal test to apply for a learners permit and eventually test for a drivers liscense. Driving is a symbolic step in a teenagers life signaling freedom and independence from their parents, however, with the ever-so-quickly evolving technological and engineering professions, this key factor is a teenagers life could be bypassed, similar to how an exit may be bypassed on an expressway. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" driverless cars may be an option of the future. Driverless cars can be a beneficial investment.

Autonymous and semi-autonymous cars are evolving, rapidly, into safer vehicles than human-operated vehicles; tests have shown this since the 1980's when automakers used speed sensors at the wheels of vehicles in creation of antilock brakes. Now, if a person is in danger of skidding out of control or rolling over, the cars brakes can prevent this. Its also extremly prevalent here, in Indiana. A cars antilock brakes may assist an individual to stop at a slippery intersection on ice once the car notices that it is not decelerating at the rate expected by its computer. Another reason why driverless cars are a beneficial invenstment is BMW's development and release of the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" We all know that traffic jams in bigger cities such as: Chicago, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and even on freeways like Interstate-94 can be frustrating. However, with this stylish invention ones semi-autonymous car may handle the driving functions, that of a human, at up to speeds up to 25 mph. If one does not have to worry about focusing on the constant start-stop of the traffic, their trip may become substantially more enjoyable. Moving forward, driverless cars can be a beneficial investment because teenagers may like driving a semi-autonymous car versus a normal car better. Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver stresses, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way"" One way that this could be done is by bringing in-car entertainment and informaton systems that use heads-up display. These displays can be turned off when the driver is needed to take over. This also doubles up as a safelty feature, which is a huge proponent in passing laws permiting these types of cars.

In conclusion, driverless cars are a very promising option of the future, with which I support. They are proven to be more succcessful and could benefit modern america, as well as, the rest of the world by helping Indians in India with the subpar driving conditions with which they endure. They can also help Americans with heavy traffic jams in megatropolis' such as New York and Chicago. I believe that Driverless cars can be a beneficial investment and you should too.",0
"I am against the development of driverless cars for many reasons. Personally I feel as though people are starting to get more and more lazy these days with the help of technology. I believe it would be much more safe for someone to manually drive a car, rather than put your trust into a computer. There is a wide range of possibilities that could go wrong with driverless cars out on the roads.

My first reason is that the car could malfunction. Whoever programmed the car could have messed up and gave the car a defect. Then someone would buy that defected car and most likely get into a crash. Someone could be on a highway while the car system fails, crashing into a semi truck. Theres a possibility that the car could completely shut off, leaving you stranded in the middle of nowhere. Also GPS these days isn't very reliable, the car could take you completely off route trying to follow GPS.

My second reason is that someone could hack your cars system. Somebody that strongly dislikes you could get in your car and ruin its system. Even worse, people would start paying a hacker to destroy car systems. While you're out on the road relaxing in your driverless car, a hacker could take control of your car giving it directions. That means while your stuck in your car, someone is in control of your life deciding if they want to crash your car.

My third reason is that it's not very safe. I don't think putting all of your trust into a vehicle is a very smart idea. The sensor on the car could go out with your knowledge, causing it to crash. There could be road construction that the car is not aware of, potentially driving straight into the construction site. Your city might have certain driving regulatons that the car won't know about, which could give you a ticket from a cop.

My fourth reason is that you could be put at a higher risk of getting in a car accident. What if a little boy is getting his ball in the road? The car might not see him with the sensors, causing the car to drive right into the boy. You could be texting on your phone and then out of no where a car is comming right towards you. It's too late to gain control of the car because you were so busy texting, resulting in a car crash. Maybe you're tired so you take a nap while your car is on its way to the casino. Your car could crash at any moment, because you're not awake and not paying attention to the road.

In conclusion, there are multiple reasons why a driverless car wouldn't be safe. whether it's due to a malfunction, hacker, or even safety issues driverless cars are not safe. I hope after reading this you realize there are way more cons than pros with driverless cars. It's better to do things right by yourself, rather than putting your trust into technology.",0
"A grade B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities would be a great policy change. This would be a great change for many reasons, but overall it will help better our students knowledge and the school's overall grade review.

To start off, having a B average would be a great policy change because students will work harder and learn more to be able to participate in sports. For example, my school has a C grade average requirement to be able to participate in sports or other extra curricular activities and my friend RELATIVE_NAME is on the basketball team. He informed me he had a D, and after hearing this policy, he repeatedly studied and aced as many tests as he could in order to stay on the team. So if this works for him, it should work for other students who care to participate in other activities. This policy change will also be a good requirement because it will help students participate more in other activities such as advanced placement classes or even tutoring, showing their appreciation. For example, I knew this boy named RELATIVE_NAME in the 6th grade, he wanted to be on the dance team, but discovered he needed a C average, and he really enjoyed dancing. He had an F in language arts, and he decided to bring it up to satisfy his passion for dancing, so he took on tutoring every Tuesday and Thursday to improve his writing skills, and by the end of that very month, he improved his grade to a B and was dancing at performances every week after school. This is just two of many reasons why a B grade requirement to participate in extra curricular activities would be a good thing, because if students work this hard to maintain a C to participate in activities, they would definitely work harder to maintain a B average to participate in school activities.

Another example of why i think this would be a great policy change is because it would help our school overall. For example ,last year my school offered an FCAT boot camp program to help students better their knowledge before a big test, and almost all 7th graders did significantly well, raising our school average to an A overall. So if just one grade level could do it, if all the grade levels in our school required an average of a B, our schools overall outlook would change significantly. Another example of this helping our school overall is that just last week, our social studies class had a mid-term exam, and everyone in the class received a B or higher, and the grade point average of our period raised significantly. So, if the whole school was to maintain a B, our averaged statistics would significantly change as well, just on a higher scale. That is why i think that having a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities would be a great policy change.

In conclusion, making the grade requirement to participate in sports or other activities a B, would be a great policy change because it will show how much students care , and improve their learning skills, and also improve our schools overall grading average.",0
"Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its impact is minimal. In my opinion, social media has had a profound impact on society, shaping our norms and values in various ways.

One of the primary ways in which social media has influenced society is by changing the way we communicate. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical location. However, this increased connectivity has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which can have negative consequences on mental health and social skills.

Moreover, social media has also had a significant impact on our perception of beauty and body image. With the rise of influencers and celebrities on social media, people are constantly bombarded with images of ""perfect"" bodies and beauty standards. This can lead to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and eating disorders, especially among young people.

Furthermore, social media has also played a role in shaping our political beliefs and values. Social media platforms have made it easier for people to access information and express their opinions. However, this has also led to the spread of misinformation, propaganda, and hate speech. Social media algorithms often prioritize sensational content, which can reinforce existing biases and create echo chambers. This can be detrimental to democracy and the functioning of society.

In addition, social media has also had an impact on our relationships. Social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat have made it easier for people to connect with each other, but they have also created unrealistic expectations about relationships. People often present a curated version of themselves on social media, which can lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction in real-life relationships.

Finally, social media has had a significant impact on our consumer behavior. Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook have made it easier for businesses to target specific audiences with their advertisements. This has led to an increase in consumerism and materialism, which can have negative consequences on the environment and our well-being.

In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has made it easier for people to connect with each other and access information, it has also led to negative consequences such as body dissatisfaction, the spread of misinformation, and an increase in consumerism. It is essential for individuals and society as a whole to be aware of these impacts and to use social media responsibly.",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that your first policy which is allowing us to bring our phones to school and keep it off in all classes except lunch times and at other free times is a delightful idea if i do say so my self. As the president, captain cheer leading, and in charge of chess club I think your strategy may work like for example if you bring your phone and you use it and you constantly get it taken away and yelled and teachers call you belligerent student that is not going to work but if he or she changes their belligerent ways. I think that this policy will be a remedy for our problems and our action. This policy is like a compromise if you think about it would not be going your way and it will not be going their way that way they can use their phones during free time and learn during class hour I think it's a ""win win "" situation both for the children and you. I think you should do it we would not want to start a bedlam would we?

Another reason why the second policy is not as good as the first is because the whole time students would sneak the phones into class. then the teacher would take it away, then the student would go to the office, and then the students mind would stay stagnant and not germinate like it is supposed to. trust me ms surah you would not want that to happen!

So instead of making the conflict of cell phones more difficult than it should be you should choose policy two so that we could be together in unison instead of all of us running around like crazy people and children tell the truth that's why policy two is better if i do say so myself.

Love:

your president , captain of cheer leading and in charge of chess

"How do you feel about students having to do an extracurricular activity? I believe that it would help students be better people. These activities will keep them out of trouble. Extra activities with new people will help improve the social skills of students. Activities such as sports will keep them healthy and active. Do you not want students to be better people for others, and themselves?

First, Students that have an extracurricular activity will stay out of trouble. When a student is doing something good for them self, and they enjoy it, they will not be getting into much trouble. If students are playing a sport they will be motivated to stay healthy and stay away from drugs. Most extra curricular activities require good behavior. Therefore, if a student gets attached to an activity they will do their best to stay out of trouble.

Secondly, Students that less social skills can meet new people. Those students can create strong, long lasting bonds. Extra curricular activities can give students the friends they need that make them happy. Some friendships are even like family, and those types of bonds are important. We need students to have strong bonds and stronger social skills.

Finally, These activities can keep the students healthy, and active. Sports will have students always moving and keep them in shape. Some activities will teach you about nutrients and how to support your body. Activities like these will keep you healthy and make you feel better about yourself. If everyone participates in these activities than everyone will be happy, healthy, and active.

In conclusion, I believe that extra curricular activities will make students a bigger part of society. These activities will get students to behave. The students will be healthy. The activities will give the students better social skills. That is why I believe that extracurricular activities will make students be better people.",0
"Requiring community service or extra punishment for students who violate school regulations is an important decision that can have a significant impact on the students and the school community. On the one hand, requiring community service can give students an opportunity to learn valuable skills, while also more generally instilling in them a sense of responsibility to their community. On the other hand, extra punishment, such as suspension, can have a strong deterrent effect, sending a message to the rest of the student body that actions have consequences. 

Having experienced the effectiveness of both approaches while in school, I believe that, for serious violations, suspension is the more appropriate approach. First, it sends a more serious message that violations will not be tolerated, able to shift the culture of a school in a short amount of time. The experience of suspension itself can also help remind students to take their academics and behaviors more seriously, and the lack of attendance may help students target their studies with greater focus. Ultimately, I think that a combination of both approaches is best; mandatory community service and supplements of harsher punishments when warranted provide a system of checks and balances that can be used to effectively deter students from breaking school regulations.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have significant implications for students, their families, and the local school district. While some may argue that this additional time would improve student performance, I believe that it would have negative consequences on student relationships and overall well-being.

Firstly, adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have a significant impact on student performance. While some may argue that this additional time would allow students to learn more and perform better academically, I believe that it would lead to increased stress and burnout. Students already face a lot of pressure to excel academically, and adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would only increase that pressure. Additionally, students may struggle to balance their academic workload with their extracurricular activities and personal lives, leading to decreased overall well-being.

Furthermore, adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have negative consequences on student relationships with their families and peers. Students already struggle to balance their academic workload with their personal lives, and adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would only make this more challenging. Students may miss out on quality time with their families, leading to strained relationships and decreased overall happiness. Additionally, students may struggle to maintain their relationships with their peers, as they may not have the time to socialize and connect with their friends outside of school.

Finally, adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would have significant implications for the local school district. The school district would need to invest in additional resources, such as teachers and facilities, to accommodate the increased student population. This could lead to increased costs, which may not be feasible for some school districts. Additionally, the school district may struggle to find qualified teachers to fill the increased number of positions, leading to decreased overall quality of education.

In conclusion, while some may argue that adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day would improve student performance, I believe that it would have negative consequences on student relationships and overall well-being. Additionally, it would have significant implications for the local school district, leading to increased costs and potential decreased quality of education. Instead of adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day, schools should focus on finding innovative ways to improve student learning and well-being",1
"Dear Principal,

The issue of whether community service should be required has been brought to my attention.

Although some student think this could take up the time they have to do the things they need and want to do, others think it should be mandatory.

I would have to side with those who think it shouldn't be required.

If you're going to do community service for people, it shouldn't be forced, it should be something that you choose to do.

I think that our school should have a few days of a certain month that we have to do community service, but only to show students that it can be fun and they can volunteer where they want to work and who they want to work with.

Volunteering is something that should be done out of the goodness of your heart, but if students are exposed to different types of it, they may be more likely to go out and help people, not because their forced to, but because they want to.

Students should have some say in where they volunteer and who its with so I think that there should be a sheet that they fill out saying where we would like to work and a list of the three people you would enjoy working with the most.

Every Friday in April should be a community service day where students choose out of a few choices where they would like to work.

They should be grouped with other students who would also like to volunteer at the same place.

As well as exposing kids to different places to volunteer, this will also give them a chance to be with other kids they may not see all the time.

It could be a great opportunity for students and teachers alike.

The students help out where help is needed and it gives teachers a chance to catch up on and grade things that they may be a bit behind on.

If students are given this exposure to community service and all its benefits, they will be more likely to go out and volunteer on their own.

Only a few times a month per year should students be asked to do community service and the rest should be when they decide to do it on their own time which, I hope, will be fairly often!

Thank you for listening to my concerns!

Sincerely,

"Summer projects are an excellent way to ensure that students continue learning during their break. However, the question remains as to who should design these projects - the teacher or the student? In my opinion, summer projects should be student-designed.

Firstly, student-designed projects allow for greater autonomy and creativity. When students are given the freedom to choose their own projects, they are more likely to select topics that genuinely interest them. This leads to a more engaging and meaningful learning experience. For example, a student interested in photography could design a project that involves taking pictures of different landmarks in their city, while a student interested in science could design a project that involves conducting experiments at home. By giving students the freedom to design their own projects, they are able to take ownership of their learning and develop skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and time management.

Secondly, student-designed projects promote deeper learning. When students are responsible for designing their own projects, they are forced to think critically and creatively. They must identify a problem or question that they want to investigate, research the topic, develop a plan, and implement it. This process requires a deeper level of understanding and analysis than a teacher-designed project, which may only require students to follow a set of instructions. For instance, a student-designed project on the impact of climate change on local wildlife would require the student to research the topic, collect data, analyze it, and present their findings. This type of project promotes a deeper understanding of the subject matter and develops essential skills such as research, analysis, and presentation.

Furthermore, student-designed projects prepare students for the real world. In the real world, people are often required to work independently and take initiative. By designing their own projects, students are able to develop these skills. They learn how to identify problems, develop solutions, and take responsibility for their work. For example, a student-designed project on creating a business plan for a startup would require the student to identify a market need, develop a product or service, and create a marketing strategy. This type of project prepares students for the challenges of the real world and helps them develop essential skills such as entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed. By giving students the freedom to choose their own projects, they are able to take ownership of their learning and develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and time management. Student-designed projects promote deeper learning and prepare students for the real world. They allow students to identify problems, develop solutions, and take responsibility for their work. By allowing students to design their own projects, we are not only ensuring that they continue learning during their break but also preparing them for success in the future.",1
"Title: The Negative Consequences of Career Identification in High School and the Importance of Nontraditional Paths

Introduction

In today's rapidly changing world, the pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school is becoming increasingly common. While some may argue that this approach can provide clarity and direction, I believe that it can have negative consequences on a student's personal and professional growth. In this essay, I will explore the negative consequences of requiring students to identify a career by the time they enter high school and provide examples of individuals who have achieved success by taking nontraditional paths after high school.

The Negative Consequences of Career Identification in High School

The pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school can lead to a narrow focus on a specific field, limiting a student's opportunities for exploration and personal growth. Students may feel pressured to choose a career based on their parents' or peers' expectations, rather than their own interests and passions. This can lead to a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in their chosen career, as they may not have truly explored all of their options.

Moreover, the pressure to identify a career path can lead to a lack of flexibility in a student's education and career trajectory. Students may feel that they must take specific courses or pursue certain extracurricular activities in order to achieve their desired career, even if those activities do not align with their true interests or passions. This can lead to a rigid and inflexible approach to education, which can hinder a student's ability to adapt to changes in the job market or their own personal goals.

Examples of Successful Nontraditional Paths

Despite the pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school, many individuals have achieved success by taking nontraditional paths. For example, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful media personalities in history, did not attend college and instead began her career as a local news anchor. Similarly, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, dropped out of high school and instead pursued his passion for technology and innovation.

These individuals, and countless others, have demonstrated that success can be achieved through a variety of nontraditional paths. By exploring their interests and passions, they were able to identify",1
"""Failure is not the worst thing, not to try is worst thing in the world."" To become successful, people must try. They should not give up. If people fail and grow up without losing hope, they can be successful in their future. Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life.

Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she don't like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.

Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didn't pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesn't mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life.

Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And people have to have positive energy and hope to handle any situation. Because failure is an important role that plays in the pursuit of success.",0
"Title: The Importance of Setting Goals

As the 3rd President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson once said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This quote highlights the importance of setting goals and striving towards them. While some people argue against setting goals, there are many examples of individuals who have achieved great success by setting specific targets for themselves.

One of the main arguments against setting goals is that it can be limiting. People who set goals may become so focused on achieving them that they neglect other aspects of their life. Additionally, setting goals can be stressful and may lead to disappointment if they are not met. However, these potential drawbacks do not outweigh the benefits of setting goals.

Setting goals can provide direction and purpose in life. It can help individuals identify what they want to achieve and give them a clear roadmap to reach their goals. Furthermore, setting goals can be motivating and provide a sense of accomplishment when they are met.

There are many anecdotes of individuals who have achieved great success by setting specific targets for themselves. For example, Oprah Winfrey set a goal to become a talk show host and eventually achieved her goal by launching her own show. Similarly, Michael Jordan set a goal to become the best basketball player in the world and achieved his goal by winning six NBA championships.

It is interesting to note that some people set easier goals and others set more difficult goals. This can be attributed to a variety of factors such as personal beliefs, past experiences, and available resources. However, it is important to remember that setting difficult goals can lead to greater satisfaction and accomplishment when they are met.

Those who have achieved great success by trying hard have used a variety of strategies to reach their goals. These strategies include setting SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound), breaking goals down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and celebrating small victories along the way.

In conclusion, setting goals is an important aspect of achieving success in life. While there are potential drawbacks to setting goals, the benefits far outweigh them. By setting specific targets and striving towards them, individuals can provide direction and purpose in their lives, achieve great success, and find a sense of accomplishment.",1
"Dear Principal,

You should allow kids to use there cell phones during lunch because they will be less likely to break the rules. The reason why kids break the rules is because they want to be able to brag about something they did that was against the rules or because they're simply not allowed to do it. This way, kids can't brag or the ones that do it because they can't will use it during lunch.

They could also talk to their parents if there's an issue that needs clarifying. Kids may need to be picked up early and aren't too sure about what to do. Maybe they need help with homework that they don't understand. If they don't feel good they could ask their parents to pick them up. Those are some advantages of use during lunch.

If there is an emergency during lunch they could call for help. If someone gets in a fight they could call someone to break it up. If there was a break in they could call the police. If there is a fire they could call the fire department. These are unlikely, but they could happen.

Those are the advantages of letting kids use cell phones during. They could feel sick and need to get home. They could see a fight going on and call someone to break it up. These are only some of the advantages of letting kids use cell phones during lunch. I hope this can convince you to use this policy.

"Students that use the way of the internet to execute their online work, should have the choice to either take online classes or physically be in the classroom. In a way, online classes help the student if they obtain a focusing disability, the course can be slowed down, and the student can take their time while also having the ability to learn. Also, physically being in a class can be very distracting because of other students, video games that may be brought to class, or just the loudness a class can come up to.

Online classes give a student and their teacher hands on with teaching, if there is something interrupting the students lesson mentally, teachers can figure out and pin point the main problem easier and faster than in a classroom filled with twenty or more kids. Video conferencing is another alternative that lets the instructor visually observe how the student reacts to something new, teenagers tend to pay more attention when they are alone than when they are in a crowd of peers meaning, alone time for teens and anyone gives them time to think and process information.

A downside to online classes is that students may not make friends as often as they would in public or private school, homeschooling is a challenge but should not be looked down upon just because the lack of social communication a child may have, as long as the child graduates and tends to do really well with their progress in online classes then there is no reason that they should be put into public or private education, unless said otherwise by the student themselves.

Every parent wants nothing but the best for their child, if online classes and virtual conferencing is one of them then that option should be taken up on. In a stance of things, school and education come first and if a student would rather go to a party to amp up their social status then homeschooling is not for them and they should be placed in publice schooling. Homeschool is a learning system for people who want to work better towards their goals which may include college, a job after highschool, or even into the military.

Any and everything needs an educational background and it all depends on how a student wants to execute it towards what they want to do later in life, if they are stronger in public school then they should be placed in that branch, if they are stronger in private school then they should not even have a second thought towards that decision, but if they are willing to drop those two options and homeschool where you are head on with an instructor, then that should be an option if they want first hand help with their work.       ",0
"To the principle:

I strongly believe that the policies that you are considering are both great policies for a school, but I lean more towards policy number one. You may ask yourself why i support this policy more than policy number two.

Well, I support policy number one more because if you don't allow students to have phones at school at all, then that will just trigger something in their minds that says ""You can't bring your phone to school, I won't get caught so I'll just take my phone to school"" or "" If I can't have my phone, how am I going to let my parents know that something may have happened, well I guess I'll should just take it just in case of an emergency.""

I support policy one because lunch and other free times is the only time that students get to socialize with others and why not socialize with friends or family that they don't see often? This will allow students to know that going to school can be somewhat fun. I also support this policy because it will help the parents know if their kids are going to school because some phones may have a GPS to track their student's activity. If the student doesn't have their phone then it can cause their parents to worry possibly leave work to check if their child is or isn't in school. This policy will also give students a chance to call or text their parents tell them if they may have forgotten something important and ask if they could bring it to the student during school so the student wont have to turn something in for half credit.",0
"The planet venus is kinda like a extra star in our soler system, in the article it says it's ""sometimes called a Evening Star"" and it also said that ""venus is a planet"" and it is the second planet from the sun it's a good pursuit.

The people of start to work on spacecraft so they can see what is out there and the first place they went to was the moon then mars and now venus in the article it says ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" and the article also says that the challenging part is the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere so for the people that want to pursuit the planet venus it would be a good idea to look for information online or ask for information from any space programs that might be happening near you or if that doesn't help you ask people that work with stars planets and constlation at the planetarium.

"Dear Principle,

I as a former sports player think that taking sports away from those to whom do not consist of having a grade of a B average does not seem very fair. I myself am sure that they can bring up their grades and can try to maintain a B average. Although for some students it is a bit of a struggle to keep a B average because they are so very active in their school and their community. Well with all the things they do and having to keep up with all their school work it may be a bit hard to keep a B average and so they end up maintaining a C average which is still considered passing. I know you want us to strive for excellence and go above and beyond and don't just keep our C average just because its passing. For those who struggle in some areas of school it takes them time to learn the material and they cant quite maintain a B average like your asking.

Personally I love to win my meets and games that I play at. I love the feeling I get when I know that I accomplished something that day by winning. I also know for a fact that you as our principle love how it feels when other teachers and staff from other schools comes up and congratulates you on how awesome your sports and other clubs and such are doing. But if you change the school policy to having only kids with a B average and above get to play sports and do the clubs we have then you wont get that good feeling because many kids who do sports or participate in school events or clubs maintain a C average. That means we wont win much because we wont have enough kids on the sports teams or in the clubs to help us win. So i say you keep it at having let kids with a C average play sports or other activities in our school because they love sports and participating in school clubs and such. They just are not as good as some kids who can maintain a B average or above and still participate in the clubs or sports or whatever they like to do after school. I am asking as a former sports player that you let kids who can maintain a C average or above play sports or do any of the activities they like to participate in after school.",0
"In my opinion, driverless cars are a bad idea.

Yes, I get that it would save fuel and be much more convenient for everyday life, but i think it would cause more problems.

I think it is unnecassary to try to make these driverless cars becuase it could cost a lot, and end up not working out in the long run

First off, in my eyes these driverless cars would just cause more problems for everyday life.

These driverless cars would have trouble getting through complicated areas such as detours, road blocks, parking lots, etc.

And even though there are positive effects for this type of car, I think there are many more negative effects that could put lives at risk, and waste a lot of time getting places.

Do we have the technology to make these driverless cars happen?

Absolutely, but the risk/reward is not worth it in my opinion.

Whats wrong with just hopping in your car and driving it yourself?

""Backseat"" drivers that try to tell the actual drivers what to do are already bad in todays world, just imagine a backseat driver trying to yell at a robot driving their car.

Overall, I think trying to make these driverless cars a reality is not worth the time or money.

It would be much easier and safer to have humans controlling their cars and evaluating the situation through their own eyes to mkae the judgement on what or what not to do.

I do not see anything wrong with todays ways of transportation so why fix something thats not broken?",0
"Hey there!  So, you're asking us to research the effects of culture, practice, and adjustment on first impressions, and how they can change.  Like, I know it's a pretty deep topic, but I'll do my best to dive in. 😅

First of all, let's talk about culture.  Culture plays a huge role in shaping our first impressions of people. For example, in some cultures, it's common to greet someone with a hug or a kiss on the cheek, while in other cultures, it's more common to shake hands or bow.  I mean, can you imagine if you went to a party and someone gave you a hug without asking? 😳 It would be so awkward! But, on the other hand, if you're in a culture where hugs are a common greeting, it could make you feel more comfortable and relaxed around that person. 

Now, let's talk about practice.  Practice can also shape our first impressions. For instance, if someone is really good at a particular skill or activity, we might be more likely to form a positive impression of them.  Like, if someone is a great singer or musician, you might be more likely to think they're cool and talented.  But, on the other hand, if someone is really bad at something, it could make you think they're not very smart or capable. 

Lastly, let's talk about adjustment.  Adjustment can also play a role in shaping our first impressions. For example, if someone is new to a group or situation, we might be more likely to form a negative impression of them if they don't fit in right away.  Like, if someone is the new kid in class and they don't know the rules or customs, they might get teased or bullied.  But, if they keep trying and eventually figure things out, we might start to see them in a more positive light. 

So,",1
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" The author suggets that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. The author gives us a lot of information of Venus. Also, the author tells us why its so worhty. The first reason why its worhty to sutdy Venus would be because numerous of factors contribute that venus is a challenging planet for humans to study. The second reason is that in the article the author mentions that in ""venus is sometimes around the corner -in space terms-humans have set numerous spacecraft to land on his cloud-drapped world"" Lastly the author mentions that the NASA is compelling an idea to send humans to stufy in venus.

In the article when the author mentioned that it's a challenging planet to study would be because in our solar system venus is the second planet from our sun and Venus is actualy a planet. Venus is one of the brightest points in the night. Also another reason why venus is so hard to examine would be because it's occasionaly the closest to earth. Another challenging reason would be that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet. Therefor these reason add up doesnt seem like a safe place for humans to study

The second reason why the author suggets that studying Venus is worthy would be because the author mentions that it's right around the corner in space terms each have been unnamed, and for that reason no spacecraft has survived the landing more then a few hours. That tells us how Bad the planet is now imagine sending a human. Despite of the things that has happend the author makes a conclusion that maybe thats why no spaceship has touched down on Venus in more of three decades. If you think about it if a spaceship hasn't touched down there now why would a human want to.

Lastly , the biggest detail that came from the article was that NASA is woking on other ways to study venus. The reason why it stood out the most was that if the author why lying about it being so worhty then I dont think NASA would waste time on this project. NASA has some simplified electornics made of silcon carbide and they have tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of the Venus and it has lasted while being in good conditions. The athor also mentioned that NASA has much more projects in order to be able to study Venus.

In conclussion after reading the artcle the author has given enough information on why the author belives that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The way the author described Venus would be that it isn't a happy or chill place to be at but the author did point out that it's very challenging and awarding planet to study. Not anyone can go to Venus it's not safe. So far NASA might be the first to be able to study Venus well and they'll be the first to feel that big accomplishment.",0
"Have you ever struggled in a certain activity, or just wanted to join a new club.

Many students often feel that way and don't know what to do, but there are many after school clubs that help out in that regard. Students who are struggling in certain subject could stay after school with a teacher to help in that situation. Many schools also provide sport clubs so that students interested would join, and possible lend them a scholarship into collage. Students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to make stronger bonds with others. With so many benefits to staying after school, I believe that students should stay after school in at least one club.

There are many instances in which students struggle to keep high grades up, and don't know what to do. There are many extracurricular activities that may help in that scenario. Students can find clubs in which they can get help by teachers to do work there struggling to finish.

If a student missed a day of school and can't catch up, teachers can stay after and show them and important information that they missed. Tests can bring stress to students , and even make them panic a little, when that happens students can request that teacher help them and even give tips on how to relax and focus. Trying to juggle so many things at once can be difficult for most students, but teachers are there to help out those in need.

Sport clubs are one of the most popular clubs in some schools, and for good reason. Clubs like these offer students a chance to play the sport they like and represent the school at the same time. Sport clubs also give participants the opportunity to hang out with friends and create new ones along the way. In some rare chances collages may offer them a fully paid scholarship if they see the student overall success, and while it even rarer some professionals may be interested and ask them to join there team. Sports clubs offer students many opportunities to get a head start in life and even get them interested in new hobbies.

Students coming to a new school for the first time might be timid or feel alone during the first few day, so why not ask them to come to after school. Extracurricular activities offer new students the change to make new friends and even help strengthen old ones. Many group of friends often hang out after school to just hang out or relax from the stressful day. Many clubs also relate to specific peoples interest, so people can meet others who are interested in their hobbies. Every person is unique and some may struggle to make new bonds, but after school activities can help them meet people who share the same hobbies or help steanthen bonds

After school clubs are some of the key factors in schools. They help them keep high grades, Gives students the chance to do there hobbies like sport, and may even help new kids to make bonds or steanthen them. So I Believe that students should stay after school at least once, to see new interest or make new friends.",0
"I think making the students do community service is a great idea! Kids/teenagers need to learn responsibility and kindness while growing up by doing things for other people. I think it will make the kids a lot less selfish and want to help others when they get older and become young adults. Community service is great for teens of any age to learn how to care for someone else.

Good things that teens can do to help the community would be stuff like going outside and walking along the streets in their town and picking up litter. They could even go to the nursing home in their community or around their community and help the workers and the residents with anything they can. Students could even stay after school on certain days and help the janitor with anything he/she needs cleaned, or work in the concession stand during school sporting events. Maybe even the science teachers would like to help the students with starting a garden in a spot outside, we have plenty of room! The garden would supply food which could be given to homeless shelters or food pantry's.

I know that some of the students here already do community service for fun or even for projects for school, but I really think it would be a great idea for the school to meet up with some people that do community service and offer to have people to come and help them with it. They could possibly come weekly or even monthly and take a group of students out and do whatever they need them to help with. Community service is a good way for kids to learn to work with people and help their community. We should definitely do more of it around here! It would set good examples for other schools and maybe even help the environment!",0
"Making decisions about our future can have a significant impact on the rest of our lives. We can look to many successful people who have made their own decisions and seen the positive impact they have had in their lives. For example, Bill Gates decided to drop out of college and invest his time into starting one of the world’s most successful companies. Whilst this decision was brave and unorthodox, it was essential for him to reach his professional goals. Having the support of family is also incredibly important when making decisions about the future. Not only will it provide an individual with a sense of belonging and emotional security, it will also ensure they stay grounded and make rational decisions. Seeking advice from others is also beneficial; being open-minded and taking diverse perspectives on board can only be a positive thing. Of course, patience is also vital to make sure that our dreams can be gradually achieved over time. In conclusion, making our own decisions and having the support of our family can help to ensure we reach our goals, whilst taking advice from others and exercising patience can also be beneficial.",1
"Luke Bomberger had got asked to join this program called '' Seagoing Cowboys.""

He was working at two part time jobs, one of the jobs were grocery store and the other one was the bank. Then, Lukes friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to the cattle boat in Europe. Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help. A good reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you can relize how you have good towns and good houses and some countries don't have that. It shows how you canbe helpful and you need to be greatful for what you have and dont have!",0
"Dear state senator,

I feel as though the electoral college is unfair and irrational. It has messed up so many things in the past as well as the present. The presidential elections would be more truthful about who should win compared to the system of voting we have now. This voting system is untruthful, bias, not fair to everyone else that votes as well. If the entire United States were to vote, the votes would be more honest and real. In my opinion, it is almost crucial to hear what your people have to say about the country they live in, therefore it is important to know who we want as our president.

Because we have people of a higher authority standing in for us and voting for the president, it becomes untruthful. Some of these people just vote for whom ever they want, and when something this big is just thrown out the window like that, it is the deciding factor between a good\bad leader of our country; or even whether or not the best president was chosen. But those votes that are just voted at random to say that they did their part in the election are not honest votes. These people with higher authority dont care who wins,[some of them anyway], and that his hurting the human population in the U.S..

Not only is it untruthful, it develops to be bias as well. People tend to use their personal feelings fro someone as an advantage or even disadvantage. When someone does not like a person, they can not look passed that, and during an election as big as this one, you have to be able to look passed the fact that you may dislike them and ask yourself: ""Would this person be a good, strong leader and role model for our country?"". Same way goes if you like someone, it is not right to vote for someone just because you think they are a good person, there are far more factors needed when running a country. You should ask yourself the same question: ""Would this person be a good, strong leader and role model for our country?"".

The people of the U.S. would most definitly like to have a say in who runs their country, but with the electortal college, they can not do so. The people with higher authority such as the present president, and the senators, etc. should want to hear what their people have to say, as well as use it and put it into perspective. We should decide who runs the country we live in, not just people of ""higher rank"". Please put this into perspective and help us do something about it.    ",0
"Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the job position at your esteemed organization. As an 8th-grade student, I am eager to demonstrate my skills and potential to contribute to your team.

Firstly, I have a proven track record of working well with people. In my previous roles, I have always been able to build strong relationships with my colleagues, clients, and customers. For example, during my summer job at the local ice cream shop, I was responsible for managing the cash register and interacting with customers. I always made sure to greet them with a smile and provide excellent customer service, earning me many positive reviews and repeat business. Additionally, I have always been able to collaborate effectively with my team members, whether it be through group projects or working together to complete tasks at my previous job.

Secondly, I am willing to work extra hours to ensure that the job is done to the best of my ability. I understand that sometimes unexpected events may arise, and I am always willing to step up and help out when needed. For instance, during my internship at the local library, I was responsible for organizing and restocking the shelves. On one occasion, the librarian called in sick, and I was tasked with managing the entire library by myself. I was initially overwhelmed, but I took the initiative to prioritize my tasks and make sure that everything was running smoothly. I even stayed an extra hour to finish up some tasks that needed to be completed before closing.

Lastly, I am a hard worker who is dedicated to achieving my goals. I have always been a self-motivated individual who takes pride in my work. For example, during my time at my previous job, I was tasked with creating a new marketing campaign to increase sales. I spent countless hours researching and brainstorming ideas, and eventually, I came up with a successful campaign that exceeded our sales goals. Additionally, I have always been willing to take on new challenges and learn new skills, whether it be through attending workshops or taking online courses.

In conclusion, I believe that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this job position. I am confident that I can contribute to your team and help achieve your goals. Thank you for considering my application.

"dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think community service is a great idea for kids here at our school to participate in. Kids are saying it takes to much time way but, why be watching t. v when you could go help clean up litter to make a better environment for us. In today's society people don't understand what all this pollution is doing to our world and animals.

I feel that maybe if we got all the kids in school to participate in this then would could actually make a huge difference, and maybe kids would spend more time helping and less time getting introuble. If these kids would realize what our planet will look like in ten years i think they would actually want to help. soon gas will go up a lot when we get about twenty, and things will change a lot if people keep being careless and littering.

I would personally rather be helping save our community then be watching cartoons in the morning. I think most kids these days are spoiled so they see community service as ell why should i have to do it, well there are plenty of good reasons. One to save the earth from being turned into a waste land, and knowing that you could help by doing something for your community feels great. The quote i live by when it comes to littering is, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Those three words aren't hard to do. I think you should enforce this rule and make everyone help because, what is so bad about recycling aluminum cans and paper. Today people waste way to much paper, and use way more water then what is needed.

So turn off the sink when you brush your teeth, and instead of an hour long shower you really only need five. If kids helped a little bit more with this kind of stuff, maybe they would learn a word i like to use which is, Respect. Respect for the environment and anything else they might have. We could even start a recycling club at our school so kids could join in. I think all kids need to help out and we should require kids to help out.

"Do you think students should play sports? Yes! I agree students should play spots. Students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology.

First,sports will help students with they health. When students play sports they have to move around a lot and drink a lot of water. However when students drink a lot of water and move around a lot they can lose weight. Also students will want to eat health food and not junk food. Sport will help out students with health problems.

Next,sports keep students out of trouble. Students will want to do good in school and get good grades to play in the games and to stay on the team. However if students don't keep the good work up they not going to be able to play in any of the games and they will no longer be on the team. Also if students play sports they will stop skiping class and fighting. Sports will keep a lot of students on track.

Last,sports will help students stay off technology. Now days all students do is play video games and sit on they cell phones. Everything that students do today is on technology. However if you look up how many students that play sports it's only 90% of students in the world that play sports. Students need to stay off technology and play sports more.

In conclusion,sports is something that every student should play. Sports will help students in a lot of ways. I agree that students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology.        ",0
"Thomas Jefferson was a man of great ambition and determination. He was a founding father of the United States, the third president, and the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson was a man of many talents, and he was never idle. He was a writer, scientist, architect, inventor, and philosopher, and he spent most of his life working on various projects and ideas.

Jefferson's determination to never be idle was evident in his many accomplishments. He was a prolific writer, and he wrote extensively on a wide range of topics. He was a scientist, and he conducted many experiments and made many discoveries. He was an architect, and he designed many buildings, including the University of Virginia. He was an inventor, and he invented many things, including the swivel-chair and the polygraph.

Jefferson's impact on American history is significant. He was one of the most important figures of the American Revolution, and he played a crucial role in the formation of the United States. He was a visionary, and he had many ideas for how the country should be organized and governed. He was a leader, and he inspired others to follow his example.

Jefferson's story applies to personal experiences in many ways. His determination to never be idle is something that we can all learn from. We should all strive to be productive and to make the most of our time. We should all be ambitious and have big goals for ourselves. We should all be willing to work hard and to take risks in order to achieve our dreams.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson was a man of great ambition and determination. He was never idle, and he accomplished many great things in his life. His impact on American history is significant, and his story applies to personal experiences in many ways. We can all learn from his example and strive to be productive, ambitious, and determined in our own lives.",1
"I think that we should keep the

Electoral College because changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States can be bad. It can be bad because if majority of the people pick a president and he's not a good president and they are just picking him to pick him then he might not be a good president , he might just be popular aka well known. We should keep the Electoral College because it is fair and it is going by all of the votes , not just the popular votes.

""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes, is required to elect the President.""

Which means it is a non-democratic method. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. The Electoral College has a better chance of having an outcome than the popular votes. ""

In 2012's election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.""

Which means the Electoral College is a much more trustworthy system than the popular vote. Electoral College has something called

""Swing States''

Swing states are states that often pay close attention to the campaign and they really listen to the competing campaign. They are the most thoughtful voters and the most thoughtful ones should be the ones to decide on everything.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states""

That is incorrect because the electoral college pays close attention to every state to see which ones would be good to pick. The Popular States says that the electoral College system is out of date and lame , The Electoral College avoids run off elections unlike the popular vote system. I am ending my claim by saying we should keep the electoral college because it is a more organized system.    ",0
"I think the principal should require community service. This is because if teaches life lessons and it is good for the community.

To begin with, I think the principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons that will help you in the future. For example, I volunteer for community service at a place called PET. This stands for Personal Energy Transportation. It is an amazing thing to do. You build all-terrain wheel chairs for handicapped people all over the world, but mostly in third world countries. The wheel chairs have three wheels and are designed to go through deep sand, over sharp rocks, and up and down steep inclines. In this workshop, it teaches teamwork, and makes you more mechanically minded. It is also a very courageous, bold, selfless thing to do and it will really change someone's life. Another example is that people sometimes down want to do certain activities because their boring. With required community service that will have to do things that they normally wouldn't do. By doing these things they build character and self esteem. This will help them in the future with doing homework, getting into a good college, and even with wanting to do community service again. This is why our principal should require community service.

In addition, I think the principal should require community service because it is good for the community. It help the community in times of need. For example, when you are driving down a busy road or highway you see people throwing bags, cigarette buds, and even clothes out windows of their cars, not worrying about were they end up, in sewers, on the sides of roads, even inside animals. There are some types of community service that actually pick up all this trash around a city. This is important because it teaches character and it makes the city look better and more professional. Another example is that it community service could help other people in the community. There are elder homes where people drop off their elders that can't take care of themselves and people take care of them there. Some workers use this for community service or that is even their job. It can help you in the future to teach you how to take care of elderly people and it even help the community so the people that work out in the city don't get slowed down by having to take care of them. It could also make the elders feel wanted and feel comfortable in a new home. This is why our principal should require community service.

In conclusion, our principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons and it's good for the community. Life lessons help you later of in life when trying to apply for a college or helping out a friend. Community service also changes people's lives.",0
"Dear Principal,

I think that your idea is an excellent idea.

There are to many people who play sports or other things and than after they get hurt or can't play are left with nothing. So many people, athletes especially, don't even make it to college because they have spent so much time in practice or in games. If you can't maintain at least a B average then where do they expect to go when they are done playing.

My personal experience is a great one. I have two older brothers. One is 31 and the other 27. My older brother just finished his masters degree in marketing and is now working on his own company not only trying to take that far past his expectations, but is also going around the U.S. doing speech and debate contest. The other one is a high school graduate who is now working at the OTHER_NAME hotel as the head bar manager. Both great jobs, but different life styles. There is one major difference between the two though. One has gone of to college and the other stopped at high school. RELATIVE_NAME my 27 year old brother has had a great life so far, but always having his burden of not going to college. The reason is, is that he didn't have a good enough GPA. He played sports his whole life and was the star. He had one to many injuries though to keep on going. By the time he realized that he wouldn't be getting a scholarship because he was done getting hurt and didn't want to play was when he also realized that he couldn't get into college because of his grades.

This is why you shouldn't be allowed to play sports unless you have a B average. If this was the case when my brother played football he might have a completely different life. With a B average even if sports or some other activity doesn't take you where you want to go you know that you will have your back up plan with your grades.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you today to discuss a matter of great importance to me and my fellow students. I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. I understand that there are rules and regulations in place to ensure that students are maintaining their academic performance, but I believe that there is more to life than just academics.

As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of trying hard and making good decisions. It is not enough to just get good grades, but it is also important to be involved in extracurricular activities. Participating in sports and activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. It can also help students build self-esteem and confidence.

I understand that some students may struggle to balance academics with sports and activities, but I believe that it is important for them to try. It is not enough to just give up and focus solely on academics. Students should be encouraged to find a balance and make good decisions about how they spend their time.

I also believe that allowing students to participate in sports and activities can help them achieve their goals. Whether it is getting into college or pursuing a career, participation in extracurricular activities can help students stand out and demonstrate their dedication and commitment.

In conclusion, I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. It is important for students to try hard and make good decisions, and participation in extracurricular activities can help them develop important skills and achieve their goals. I urge you to consider this matter and make a decision that will benefit all students.

Sincerely,

" My mother's uncle, Generic_Name, had a dream of becoming a lawyer. He worked hard to achieve this goal, taking all the necessary steps to attend college and pay for his classes. Generic_Name woke up early every morning to attend college and later took a bus to work. After years of hard work, he became a lawyer. However, he soon realized that the real challenge lay ahead. Despite his success, Generic_Name never imagined that he would face obstacles that would test his resilience and determination.

After two years of graduation, Generic_Name found a job, bought a house, and a car. He was content with his life, but he soon realized that he had reached a plateau. He no longer had any aspirations or goals to strive for. In my opinion, this is a mistake. We should never stop striving to be better than we were yesterday. If we don't try to do something beyond what we have already mastered, we will never grow and have the experience to lead a better quality of life.

We need to keep pushing ourselves to learn and grow. Every experience we have, no matter how small, can help us to gain knowledge and a better understanding of the world around us. If we never take on new challenges, we will never have the opportunity to learn and grow. For example, if we go to college and complete our degree, but we stop there, we will never have the chance to apply what we have learned and make a real difference in the world.

Furthermore, if we continue to learn and grow, we will have a better quality of life. We will have the skills and knowledge to succeed in our careers, and we will be able to help others. For example, if we continue to learn and improve our skills, we will be one step closer to our goals and be able to make a positive impact on the world.

In conclusion, I believe that we should never stop striving to be better than we were yesterday. We should always have aspirations and goals to work towards, and we should never stop learning and growing. This will not only help us to achieve success in our personal and professional lives, but it will also help us to lead a better quality of life.",1
"Though the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is very interesting to read about, I do not believe it should be present in the classroom. There are a few issues I believe could be argued against using this software in a classroom setting. The FACS should be developed more and put through serious testing before being put in the classromm setting, but there were several other valuable uses for the program. The problems with the system in a school setting are the complexity of the system, the possible issue of privacy, and the accuracy of its predictions.

The FACS is a great idea that could have many applications other than schooling and several of these are included in this article, but it is currently too complex for school networks to handle. The author states outright in paragraph seven, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" The school computers that we use are even more out of date than the one I use at home and if it cannot run the system the school won't be able to without a major upgrade of technology or a major downgrade of the FACS, neither of which is desirable. The technology uprade needed for school computers would be too large of a bill to be practical in all but the richest of schools. The downgrade of the system to a simpler form will essentially defeat it's purpuse by killing its effectivity.

Another issue with the FACS in a school setting is privacy. How are we to be sure that they are not going to use our faces to gain access to things such as confiscated phones or to possibly find profiles online of students? Because this system requires a camera to see your face and put it through a detailed analysis, facial recognition security software like faceID on the Iphone X

then becomes a security concern. In paragraph six the author also mentions, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system in schools would essentially let the build a personal marketing profile on every student in the country.

The accuracy of the FACS would also have to be put through intense testing to determine how effective it actually is. Prof. Huang says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If the system thinks that a student is confused when they actually aren't though, it could hurt their academic growth. It would be changing the material to a lower level in an attempt to interest them, but also at the same time lowering their understanding of the material.

In conclusion, I do not believe that this system would be as effective of a tool as it needs to be to offset the dangers it poses. The money needed for the complexity, the threats to privacy, and the questionable accuracy and adaptability of the system are too concerning to support the FACS as it now stands. If these concerns were addressed the possibly it could be an effective tool, but for the foreseeable future it is not.",0
"I belive my claim for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions are invading our private space. What i'm trying to say is what if they computer says the wrong things or if we feel something that could be embarrasing or offended it'll cause us to either become more emotional or angry/offended. I believe you will also be taking jobs of those who have went to college to major in this type of senarios. If you are taking all of this for people to have it on a computer software then you are no better than hispanics or immagrants taking people jobs because it'll lessen the chance of people even knowing or wanting to become in their life. Yes we need to advance technology to better help people but,people still have their rights and beliefs and you would be crossing the line in my opinion if you were to believe this idea. I say let the professionals handle it who are in some ways the same way cause the computers would be screening us humans when there are other professional humans to relate or more capable of helping someone than a software and if the system goes wrong then what will you guys do then? What i'm trying to say is just let people who can relate and have diplomas for this kind of stuff let them do their jobs and stop replacing humans with machines because it'll be another Great Depression coming to you.",0
"Passage 1:

Cars are one of the main ways in which people move from one place to another. They are quick and convenient, but they also produce a lot of pollution. If more people used alternative forms of transportation, like bikes or public transportation, it would be much better for the environment.

Passage 2:

Cars are a major source of air pollution. They produce emissions that harm people’s health and contribute to climate change. If more people walked or cycled instead of driving, it would help to reduce the amount of pollution in the air.

Passage 3:

Cars are expensive to own and operate. They require a lot of fuel and maintenance, especially if they are used on a daily basis. If more people used public transportation or carpooled with others, they could save money on gas and other car-related expenses.

Based on these passage prompts, here's an essay:

In the present times, cars are the most preferred means of transportation. While they may be quick and convenient, there are many disadvantages of over-reliance on cars that can negatively impact the environment and our lives. However, limiting their usage can help us to reduce pollution, save money, and stay healthier.

Cars contribute to a lot of air pollution which has serious long-term effects on our health. The harmful gases emitted by cars have been linked with respiratory illnesses and allergies which are becoming prevalent. Moreover, car emissions are a major contributor to climate change which affects our planet's weather patterns and the overall environment. Limiting car usage can help to reduce the amount of air pollution that we produce and help us breathe better.

Cars are also expensive to purchase and maintain. They require a considerable amount of fuel to operate which is quite costly. Additionally, car owners need to pay insurance premiums, pay for maintenance, and other expenses. If people opt to use public transport, carpooling, or ride on bicycles, they'd save a significant amount of money and reduce their transportation expenses.

Furthermore, using bikes and public transportations will help to reduce traffic congestion. In the morning and evening peak times, cars cause traffic jams that lead to frustration and wasted time in commutes. If more people use public transportation, there'd be a lesser need for cars which reduces congestion and the number of cars on the road, thereby making our commutes faster, smoother, and",1
"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth grader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year. For example when I first came into high school as a ninth grader I wasn't sure of what I wanted to be once I graduate. Now I am a senior at Generic_school and I have two option to choose from.

In my perspective I believe that at a young age mindset changes; you find new interest in things and also our mind isn't fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen; we aren't mature wisely on what we want. I think the student should started preparing them self once they're in junior year which is when they're a eleventh grader. My reason for saying that is because you're close to graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career you've chosen for a long period of time.

I don't think its a bad idea but i wouldn't agree with it because I know how this generation is like and we need more teacher to start talking to them seriously about life after high school. These past year a huge amount of student have dropped out of school because they do not feel like they have support from teacher, friends, or even their own parents; or maybe the student think they can't afford college; not many teacher talk to them about financial help or support.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that community service is a great requirement to obtain with the students. There are a majority of students that believe that this is a reasonable decision, however, there are some students that think that it is an irrational decision.

From my perspective, I would do the work because despite the fact that I play a lot of basketball and volleyball leagues at once, even I can fit in some community service. I don't believe that it is a matter of being able to fit it into your schedule, but a matter of being motivated to participate in these events. In the past I have taken part in some community service activities, when I reflect on those memories I have come to realize why some young adults as well as children do not like them. This is because there are two different types of community service events. One's that you can take part in and enjoy and ones that are boring that you have to put up with anyway. These can be fit into categories for different people interests.

Another variable is the benefit of participating in these events. Sometimes if there is no positive end result applying to themselves or benefit of participating in these events than children will prevent any way to help. If we can some how create realization and open peoples eyes to the opportunities that are right in front of them than that will reduce the population of children preventing the work. The benefit can be a prise or maybe just make them conceive and hopefully treasure how they've contributed to helping a cause or what ever the situation may be.

If you can identify the type of kid that you are dealing with than I believe that community service will be much easier to with hold within ours and many other school districts. If we can start by sacrificing time to help out than we can influence other districts and hopefully it will spread like a wild fire and create a community of children helping. With many children taking part, this may become a volunteer choice for many children or just make it an easier experience for them to acknowledge.

"Introduction:

Driverless cars are cars that can drive themselves without any human intervention. The technology is still being developed, but it is expected to change the way we travel in the future. The article “Driverless Cars are Coming” discusses the positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In this essay, I will argue against the development of driverless cars.

Body:

Firstly, driverless cars could lead to job losses in the transportation industry. According to the article, there are over 3 million truck drivers in the United States alone. If driverless trucks become the norm, then all those drivers will be out of a job. This would have a devastating effect on the economy and on the lives of those who rely on those jobs.

Secondly, driverless cars may not be safe. The article mentions that there have been several accidents involving driverless cars. In one instance, a driverless car hit a truck and killed the passenger in the car. This shows that there are still many issues that need to be addressed before driverless cars can be considered safe.

Lastly, driverless cars could lead to a loss of privacy. The article mentions that driverless cars are equipped with sensors and cameras that collect data about their surroundings. This means that the car knows where it is and where it is going at all times. This could potentially lead to a loss of privacy for the passengers in the car.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, driverless cars are not worth the risk. They could lead to job losses, safety concerns, and a loss of privacy. While the idea of a car that can drive itself may seem appealing, the potential risks outweigh the benefits. We should focus on improving public transportation and making our roads safer for human drivers instead of investing in driverless cars.",1
"I believe that use of the Facial Action Coding System could make immediate impacts in a classroom setting. The idea of being able to see someone's inner emotions could show lots of value for teachers in the class. This machine, after being tested in the classroom, could be used to make even more accurate and in-depth machines that could go even deeper. All it takes is it starting off.

There are many benefits to having a machine that is able to accurately find someone's emotions. The applications in the classroom would help make the day for a teacher run smoothly if there was trouble with a student, or if there was something upsetting a student you could use this device. The value of knowing what your students feel could help mold a curriculum that would be the most effective for their learning. Paragraph 6 mentions that classes could have computers that could detect these emotions, and change the way the lesson is and mold it to work for that specific student.

There is no reason that the FACS shouldn't be implemented into classes. The FACS is just a more accurate way of processing and recognizing someone's emotions and feelings. We, as humans, are always performing this calculation every day, as listed in paragraph 5. We cannot tell every emotion in someone's face, as they could be hiding their emotions behind a fake smile, or hiding sorrow or sadness behind a snarl. With the FACS knowing the emotions of a student in class who is struggling could maybe help the student and teacher find a way to stop the struggle. There is nothing wrong with knowing a student's emotions so a teacher can assist them if they are struggling.

This understanding of emotions and the creation of lessons that could help with those emotions could help graduation rates for schools go up, and help the GPA or work ethic of a student to increase. These benefits all could come from knowing students' emotions as long as the FACS is put into a school's classrooms.

Some may be worried that the FACS could be unaccurate and tell wrong emotions, but claims in paragragh 3 state that muscles in your face also dictate what emotion your feeling. These muscles can also indicate whether your smile is real and you are really happy, or if your smile is fake and that your feeling something different. Trained psychologists and others in their respected fields have contributed to the FACS to try and help create accurate assumptions based on the muscle usage in a person's face.

The evolution and effectiveness of the FACS could increase with the help of its use in the classroom, and the readings could become more accurate and more beneficial to the teacher and the student. The FACS could be used in almost anywhere, but I believe that it would have the biggest impact in the classroom. The effect it could have enourmous, and all it would take is one computer software.

The FACS should be put in classroom, not only to further the research needed to help develop the software more, but to help students who may struggle with lessons in class. The FACS's ability to read emotion will benefit student and teacher when the time comes, all it needs is to find its place in the classroom.   ",0
"Imagining a time in the future when no buys cars because they don't need them is almost a utopian dream. The dream of not having to actually drive your car something every driver dreams about. Mainly because of the responsiblity and stress that is placed on your shoulder as you get into that drivers seat. Whether you're an inexperienced driver or not this could be very beneficial.

Not only do you have to be cautious of other drivers but you have to remained focused on the road. So for a student driver, or perhaps an elder who may be too impaired with medication to drive, this driveless car could benefit them. This could lower the emotional strain you have about grandma not seeing that vehicle pull out in front of her or your child crashing into another driver because they may have been texting.

For a driver education vehicle, I think this could be a good teaching device. If you look at all of the accidents that have happened while in the process of learning the rules of the road cpuld save a lot of lives. The benefits of the car, such as knowing how close you are to bumping into another vehicle, could help someone who maybe parrelle parking. The vehicle will know if you are too close to the curb you are, or may parrallel park for you!

So, in conclusion, what is my position on driverless cars? I support the idea of this vehicle however, referring to my first statement, I don't think we will ever have a vehicle that is completely driverless. Even if a computer takes over your driving, you still have to watch the road and navigate, as said in paragraph 7 of the article.

Yes, the fantasy of having a completely driverless car seems like a good idea for drivers, and teen drivers such as myself, but this could result in people revolting against the safe regulations required when you're required to follow when behind that wheel. Why wouldn't anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't they get bored waiting for their turn to drive? No, they wouldn't they still need to take caution to the road and be prepared to break, turn, and accelerate just incase the computer doesn't do it for them! Once you're behind the wheel, even if that car you're in drives itself, you still are in control and your hand still need to be on that wheel!      ",0
"Driverless cars are beingcoming more and more common with each day that the technology is evolving. I believe that in the next 30 years we will have driverless cars all over the place.

Many car companies today are well on their way to developing driverless cars, simple autonomous cars have been tested since 2009, with many car companies rushing to learn what they can about it. The reason it wasn't happening before then was because they lacked the technology. Back then, a radar was an object on a hill that cost over 200 million dollars, not something you could put on a car and use to help it on the roadways.

Driverless cars are not a bad idea, they can improve safety because they are more precise and can respond quicker to any situation thrown at them by todays everchanging road ways and transportation infrastructure. If we can improve driver and passeneger safety, why not take the chance to develop something for the future. So far, many of the tests on these cars have proven successful 90% of the time. Volvo hopes to have their first driverless car publicly available in 2020.

I believe driverless cars are going to happen somewhere in my lifetime, I won't use them because I prefer to drive myself, but I can see many using them because of their saftey.                                        ",0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Attending classes from home would not be considered beneficial due having less access to many items they could get at a school building; including school materials, communication with other students and as well as communication with teachers.

There are many materials a student need for their educational benefits. A lot of these materials are also expensive and difficult to use without the guidance of a physical teacher such as textbooks, measuring materials, graphing calculators, etc. Many of these materials are already in a school classroom, and the student has access to them for free. To spends hundreds of dollars for school material may be difficult for the student and the guardian providing for the students' needs. With each of these materials, they should be able to provide a better understanding to the content the student is learning. Often these materials are provided to schools by taxes, the community pays for materials that students use for their better understanding of whatever that subject may be. From obtaining these materials with taxes, students in that class will get a better understanding of the material they're learning, and will make their work easier to do. For example, having a graphing calculator in geometry. This is a needed material but prices can start off at $100. Not many students can simply make a huge purchase of a calculator. To have to study at home though, a graphing calculator will rarely be provided for that student, thus they have to pay that same price or even more.

Students should be put into a classroom environment and surrounded by many types of people and things. Doing so teaches the student life and communication skills in which is very useful for life after their education. They will have access to group work and presentations which provides skills of teamwork and independence in the long run. Many have difficulty in communication skills due to limiting themselves to technology usage and relying on it in many ways, including avoiding communication skills. Often, students bury themselves in technology to avoid situations of talking to others due to the feeling of anxiety and having the constant fear of ""what do they think of me?"" mindset, and never proceeding to face that fear and talk to others. For students to use technology to get their education will further reduce the basic skills of communication by not having the ability of talking to others. Communication is a skill that takes many years to develop, often adults still struggle with that skill today. Since students spend most of their life learning, they should take those twelve years of education and also learn communication among each other and even adults around them.

Having a classroom environment can also offer a better teaching and understanding of material one may learn. There would be better resources for an understanding such as a teacher going over the subject ""one on one"" with a student, and students around the individual who may have a better understanding of the topic. At home, a student is limited as to what they can do to have a better understanding of a subject they struggle in. They won't have access to ask their teacher what they are struggling in and if they do, it would be over technology and not physically there. Being physically there can allow both the teacher and student to have a better understanding of the question being asked and the question being solved or explained.

Being in a school environment can also teach the student professionalism. Schools offer dress codes or uniforms not only for distractions, but to teach the students professionalism of their dress code and behavior. Being educated on professionalism and proper adequate can help when getting a job, have better offers/opportunities, and will overall take one seriously on an eye to eye level. This is beneficial if they are ever in a tight situation in life, in which is something can is rarely learned at home. To stay home and attend classes from there, students have the leisure of relaxing at home, not worrying about their appearance and gives an excuse to limit their hygiene, their manners, and ways of going out to public places.

Schools can offer a student many opportunities to explore the future path they want to go in as well. Many offer extra curricular activities, in which include clubs, sports, or a simple gathering. Schools can also offer travel opportunities, many becoming exchange students, or simply going on a field trip. They often offer these for free or at a much lower price than if doing an extra curricular activity or traveling by oneself. Many schools also offer advice on financial aids for college. During spring or summer break, students can be sent to a college from their middle or high school to be offered many scholarship opportunities, and learn how to get scholarships and financial aid. Often, for participating in a club or sport, students can maintain a scholarship for their future as well. To have an education from home, these opportunities are often limited for that student. Participating in such can be very expensive, schools often get these prices much lower, and sometimes even free. This automatically limits opportunities for a student getting an education from home from scholarships, opportunities to know what career path they want and travel opportunities.

Students would not have a benefit from getting an education from home. Communication skills between them, adults and other students would be stripped away from them, opportunities can be taken, expenses could be very high, and they could lack material for a better understanding. Having an education from home makes that student lose the ""high school student life"", and overall not receive the best education as they could.",0
"My opinion on driverless cars is that they should not be legalized. My reasoning behind that is i dont want something else taking over my car when i dont know that its one hundred percent safe. You can be severley hurt if one thing goes bad with the operation because its such a major invention.

In paragraph nine it talks about how in some states its illegal like California,Nevada,Florida, and the District of Columbia. It aslo talks about the technology failing it says ""if technology fails and someone is injuried, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? One other detail would be that in paragraph eight they say that ""why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver""? and it says next that ""wouldnt drivers get bored waiting on their turn to drive. In paragraph seven one more conflict is that the human driver has to always be on point because certain problems can occur with the creation and thats not good at all. All in all its simply not a safe thing to create or already have because its not completely safe. In paragraph three it says the one thing that makes alot of since they talk about cost they say that ""the smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, somethat was just too expensive. If you come to a roadwork situation or driveways or compicated traffic issues you have to immediately take over or the worse will happen.

In conclusion this creation is not safe for the public there are to many problems that can occur at any time that are life threatning especially considering your on the road and your around others that can possibly be injuried along with you. If they want this project to succeded they need to fix all the bugs with this creation because i just dont agree with the situation.                   ",0
"Is keeping the Electoral College a good ideal mr/ms senator? Well if you ask me i say no. Why have it? Say the article voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors but who elect the president. Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best.

To begin with Having popular votes instead of keeping the electoral college will be better because keeping it will only cause more trouble i say. Why? Well the electoral college is know for being the ""Disaster Factor"" Sad cause not only they have a bad name for there self the Americans are also most worried about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Because of the focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states candidates hardly or mostly dont have time to put up any campaign ads. The stress of worring about the electoral college can be tuff, they dont even have to put any signs or ads. Crazy cause it's just this one process thats only counting of the electrol votes for congress.

In concusion the Electroal College consists of 538 electorals. Say the article only 270 eletroals are required to elect the president. In the article the system allows for much worse, but wrose as the election crisis in a century? Well i think so! Not even think i know so. Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cased a deciding vote for whomever they please. It's all happening, everything i said in the begining...about the trouble. Why the senate gets to choose the vice president? why cant the qualified citizens choose for there selfs. That whole area needs some enjustments before they start chooseing for people.         ",0
"Benefits of being home school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.

One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies.

Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program.

I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.

In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home. This is going to bring a big change in our community and more professional, responsible people. ",0
"Have you ever participated an extracurricular activity? Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it could help with improving sport skills, getting your homework or any other assigned work from school done early, or having tutor for an upcoming test or quiz.

Playing sports is not something we all like. However, it is something that most of us would like to learn how to play. For example, my favorite sport is soccer but lets say I'm not that good at it. Therefore, I would need to participate in an extracurricular activity that focuses on how to get better at soccer. You can also try new sports that may look interesting to you.

Another thing that extracurricular activities help with is doing your assigned homework. Since most of us don't like doing homework, mostly because they take up our free time, most of us would like some more time and help with homework. The same goes with pretty much any other school work like projects .As a result, you will get your school work done early and won't have to worry about it at home.

Tutoring can help us for an upcoming test or quiz. It can also help us with understanding things we were struggling to understand before. For example, I'm struggling to learn how to multiply polynomials. Therefore, I would participate in an extracurricular activity with tutoring for algebra. As a result, I would be able to pass my test on the multiplying polynomials.

78.75% of students would like to participate in extracurricular activities. Do you agree with participating in an extracurricular activity?

I agree to participate in extracurricular activities because it can help me with things I have a hard time understanding, help me improve with things I already know, and help me save time from doing school work at home or any other place.",0
"Some schools think it is a good idea to require students to complete a project over the summer. Many people would probably agree with this to assure that all students continue to learn over the break. The main question is weather the students should design the project or the schools and teachers should. There would be pros and cons to both decisions but what would be best for the students. Most students would likely would dread this project because it is something that is required to be completed over the summer when they should be getting a break. I think that if you wanted to ensure each student completes it then they should be the ones that design it, so it is in their best interest and it will be something that they want to do well on.

Summer break is something that is needed for students to get a relaxing break from all the stress of school; one thing that would make it less so is having them complete a summer project. A summer project is obviously something students don't want to be worrying about during a break. If teachers designed the projects students will have much less interest and it will be looked at it as something that needs to be completed as a school project. If you have the student design the project it will be looked at in a totally different way. The project would now be something that they would want to complete for themselves. They would work harder on it and be proud of the work they have done.

Another reason making the projects student designed is the best option is because some students coming from low class families don't have the materials at home to complete it or even possibly the money to buy them. When designing the project the student should and will keep this in mind so that they can ensure they have the right materials at home and if not they will make sure there is a way they can obtain them. Another problem they could run into is that there might not be adequate internet at home or even none at all. Research is a primary resource when trying to complete a project and without internet connection that is a very difficult task. Students with this issue would ensure that no research is needed or that they already know lots about the topic of their project.

One main reason that summer projects should be student designed is the students could pick a topic that they have a passion about or a hobby they enjoy. If the teacher designs the project then it could be on a topic or about something they student doesn't enjoy or has no interest in. With a summer project the students designed themselves would have a drive to complete it over the summer, and not only would they complete it they would do their best work. Having a project that students designed they would want to see it completed and see it done the best way possible.

With everything meticulously thought about and taken into account student designed is for sure they right decision if teachers want properly completed projects. With the students designing the projects there are many benefits from students actually completing it to being able to afford the materials. With student designed projects it will ensure that they complete them and enjoy the process of completing them, and once they are done they will be proud of what the have completed.",0
"Dear Principle,

I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion about the cell phone policy.

I don't see a reason to ban cell phones on campus, because some parents require their children to stay in contact with them. I think its very important to have a cell phone because if you have to stay in for detention, for example, and there is a very long line to use the office or classroom phone. There is always a plan b, Your phone. Or even in emergencies, like if you forgot your lunch money, or an assignment for one of your classes. Cell phones are useful in some ways. Some teachers might think cell phones interfere with learning, but really for me safety is first. If your thinking of letting have cell phones thank you, if not its your decision. Thank you for letting me have some of your time to express my feelings about the cell phone policy.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0
"Have you heard of the Seagoing Cowboys? If not, they are a group that was hired by the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They were hired to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules. I, Luke Bomberger, am a part of the Seagoing Cowboys.

We thinks you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys. Some reasons why we think you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys is that besides taking care of and bringing ruined coutries animals. You can visit and seeing new places such as Europe and China.

Before you can visit those wonderful places, you have to take care of the animals. You have to make sure their stalls were clean, and that they had been fed and watered two or three times a day. You also have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship you are traveling in.

There is also fun to be found on the ship. Once you have unloaded all the animals, you could play baseball or even volleyball in the empty animal holds. To pass the time people would do table-tennis tournaments. They would also do fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to also pass the time.

A job that you might have to do is night watchman. During the night, the only thing you have to do is that you would have to check on the animals every hour.

These are my reasons why you should join of the Seagoing Cowboys, and what you would have to do if you were a part of the Seagoing Cowboys.",0
"""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Heidrun Walter source 1. For many years, people have depended on cars to take them places and allow them to live a normal life. However, the recent decline in driving and car sales has proven that there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage would help reduce the greenhouse effect, would help reduce smog and other lowair pollution, as well as helping promote aspects of the eeconomy which differ from purely car sales and transportation.

To begin with, the greenhouse effect, a large part of which is caused by cars and their emissions, is endangering not only our environments and ecosystems, but also life as we know it. According to source 1 In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, passengers car are the cause of 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and also responsible for approximately 50% of emissions in certain parts of the US. Setting restrictions would allow for a decline in emission of greenhouse gases, which in turn would better life on Earth. Its effects could be seen all over the world, such as in global warming, rising oceans, etc. Therefore, limiting car usage would have a positive effect, because it would reduce the emission greenhouse gases.

Equally important, the presence of smog, pollutioncaused fog, and lowair pollution is also endangering the wellbeing of humans and other species health, as well as the wellbeing of the Earth, so to speak. According to source 2 Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""After Days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" after setting restrictions for five days, Paris saw an improvement in air quality. We can thus infer that setting restrictions regularly would help reduce the pollution and general smog of the area. Placing restrictions would help promote various means of transportation, such as public transportation, bikes, walking, etc. An example would be the one from source 3 Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota in this case, a day during which a capital city places restrictions of the use of cars, helps build a campaign, which allows for bike paths, parks, and sport centers to be created and for sidewalks to be repaired. It has also led to restrictions to regulate rushhour traffic. Clearly, reducing and limiting car usage can not only reduce smog and lowair pollution, but can also help create a more active city.

Finally, limiting car usage may promote different aspects of the eeconomy. According to source 1, the transportation bills in the US budget have, in the past, been used, for the most part, for highways. Reducing car usage may allow for certain parts of the US budget to be used for more important and diverse things, such as education, government funding, community life, and many more. Also, limitations on car usage could help conserve resources, allowing people to place their money into different aspects of their lives, like it is explained in source 4. Moreover, the less people can use their cars, the less people will buy cars source 4: ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license"". This will help people focus on rebuilding the economy. Obviously, there are economic advantages to limiting car usage, such as availability for flexibility in the government budget, conserving money, and the rebuilding of the eeconomy.

To conclude, there are various advantages to limiting car usage limitations may help improve the eeconomy, will help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and will help reduce the lowair pollution and smog often found in largely populated areas.",0
"With the years of technology advancement, Online and video classes have slowly become a popular alternative for those who prefer to not attend school in person. Many believe that those individuals that don't have a big enough income, or those who like learning in a sole person environment would benefit greatly from taking these classes, while others prefer to stick with the traditional way of learning which is sticking with regular traditional classes. Both sides have good benefits, but traditional classes overtake online classes by a big long shot.

The option to take classes online hasn't always been available. The access to mobile devices, computer, and wi-fi didn't exist at one point in time. Going back thirty years; The option to attend classes from your phone or computer wasn't a thing. Every single student that attended school had to take classes in person, which forced them to adapt to a classroom environment. The big plethora of benefits that you receive from taking regular classes ranges very far and wide, but there are only a few that should be acknowledged. These include a hands on experience, more valid information intake, support from your classmates, and it prepares you for the introduction of your future job.

Hands on learning is the number one factor that differs online classes from regular classes. Having a professional in subjects like math in your vicinity at all times is the best way for a student to get a good grasp on information. Whether it be a professor or a student; The help and guidance of another mind will always have a more significant stretch over trying to learn a subject or topic by yourself. Taking online classes will have some guidance; However, if you're stuck on your work and your not in a video call with your professor, then how are you supposed to get the answer, and looking on the internet for the answer is not the most trustworthy thing to do.

Classmates have such a huge impact because they'll be the next best thing to a professor when it comes to helping you learn. You might not understand the information, but chances are that one of your classmates fully understands it, and they will help you understand the concept most of the time. In certain situations; One might take online courses because their income cannot support them, which is totally understandable, but the circumstances of the benefits from taking online or traditional classes still apply. Being in a classroom when taking classes for your career are vital. Most businesses don't allow you to take online classes. They require you to have a certain number of hours in a certain class, and an internship on top of that.

There will always be the few that counterclaim that online classes are so much better than regular classes, and they might even go as far as claiming that they're a blessing in disguise; However, those individuals tend to throw off the potential downfalls and only look at the few benefits that exist. I agree with most of the benefits like the independent work environment, the accessibility of class from home, and the exception of taking these classes because of financial reasons, but online class students are yet and still cheating themselves out of the large mass of benefits that regular classes offer. To get the most promising outcome; Sticking with traditional classes is the way to go .",0
"Seeking advice from trusted sources when making important decisions is a wise course of action. I have personally sought and followed advice that has yielded both good and bad results, providing me with valuable insight on why it should be sought. 

The first reason why advice should be sought is that it can provide different perspectives. When I was choosing which college to attend, I sought advice from my parents, my teachers, and peers, which gave me many different opinions and viewpoints on the best choice. Each individual had different experiences and advice that helped me make a better decision.

The second reason why advice should be sought is to get guidance on difficult decisions. For example, when deciding whether to start my own business, I asked financial advisors, mentors, and entrepreneurs who had extensive knowledge and experience in the field. Their advice on both the risks and potential rewards of launching my own business helped to inform my decision.

The third reason why advice should be sought is to get help developing plans and strategies. Before embarking on a big project, I often consult other people who have done similar projects before. Their advice has proved invaluable in helping me plan out a step-by-step process for success.

Overall, consulting trusted sources for advice is an important part of making informed decisions. Personal experiences I have had have provided me with undeniable proof of the value of seeking advice, and I will continue to use this useful resource in all of my important decisions.",1
"When I first met my neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, I had a very negative impression of her. She was always seen outside her house, smoking a cigarette and talking loudly on her phone. She never seemed to be friendly or approachable, and I always felt uncomfortable around her. However, as I got to know her better, my impression of her changed completely.

One day, I decided to introduce myself to her and strike up a conversation. To my surprise, she was very friendly and welcoming. She told me about her family and her hobbies, and we quickly discovered that we had a lot in common. We both enjoyed gardening and cooking, and we even exchanged recipes.

As I continued to interact with Mrs. Johnson, I realized that my initial impression of her was completely wrong. She was not the loud, unfriendly person I had assumed her to be. Instead, she was a kind, caring neighbor who was always willing to lend a helping hand.

One example of this was when my dog got sick and I needed to take him to the vet. Mrs. Johnson offered to drive me there, even though she had never met my dog before. She was patient and understanding, and she even took the time to ask me about my dog's condition.

Overall, my experience with Mrs. Johnson taught me that first impressions can be very misleading. It's important to get to know someone on a deeper level before forming an opinion about them. By doing so, we can avoid making unfair judgments and build stronger, more meaningful relationships.",1
"Dear Principle,

I am writing this letter to you because you have decided to change the school policy on sports. I agree with you 100%. If students care so much about sports they should have to keep their grades up. If a student is not passing or doesn't have a B average they should not be aloud to play sports. If the student is so involved in whatever sport he or she is wanting to play or is playing, they will do almost anything to make the team or stay on the team. If a student is so involved in the sports then they will most likely not focus as much on there school work, which will end up making their grades drop or possibly make them fail there classes. You can get into some colleges by your athletic ability but most colleges will also look at your grades. If someone isn't as good of an athletic but have better grades they will most likley chose the person with the better grades. The reason I think they would chose the person with better grades is because we don't need to become a football or basketball player to live ,and there are a lot of people needing medicine or a good place to live and yes you can help these people but if you are a football player or some kind of player you will put that before anything because you don't want to look bad in front of your team or on NFL or NBC. I would love for this policy to be changed because students should strive and work hard for a good education. A lot of countries ,and even some cities, don't have the privilege to get to come to school and learn how to read or write. We should not take advantage of our opportunity to have a good school and good teachers. Some kids care more about sports than their grades but in the future, how many kids out of that class will end up a pro. star?

"What if cars were never invented? What if cars were so much money no one will be able to buy them? Limiting the usage of cars can help the economy and help the environment in many ways. Places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota have banned the usage of cars. They say that since they have did that congestion in the cities have gone down. Polluted cities aren't as crowded as they use to since they have banned the usage of cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of the places that has banned the usage of cars. You can still own a car but there are only two places to park your car, large garages at the end of a development or buy a psace along with a home. In article one it stated that,  ""More than 70 percent of Vauban's familis do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here,"" People siad that having a car was tense and kind of too much pressure when in a crowded city. In 2006 Vauban had become an example of  a growing trend in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, they have been the most advanced experiment in low car usage. Stores are placed on the walk away or on a main street, rather than in malls or on a distant highway.

Paris have a near-record pollution so they enfroced a partial drivning ban the clear some of the air in the global city. Motorists with even and odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home or they suffer and fine of 22-euros. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-sevn people had thier cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. Congestion was down nearly 60 percent in the capital of France after five days after the enforement of the driving fine. SInce Paris has generally more smog than other European capitals diesel fueal was blamed for it. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Delivery companies complained about the lost of revenue for cars. In aritcle two it siad, ""Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered car plates on Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia have banned usage of cars for three years straight. Cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day. Thier goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Anybody that violated that suffered a fine of $25 dollars. Aritcle 3 buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" meaning that cutting down car usage with lower the greenhouse gases in the air and clear it up. Dyas without cars is a part of a improvement capaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s, it has been the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Parks and sport centers and have bulid throughout the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks, rush-hour restirctions have cut traffic dramatically, new resturants and upscale shopping ditstricts have cropped up. Bannig cars in Bogota has been the best thing that has ever happened to the city.

In 2013, President Obama had ambitious goals to curb the United States's greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that many Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. In article 4 it said that ""as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995,"" part of that is because many Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Demographic shifts in the driving population have made the trend of banning car accelerate.

In conclusion, banning cars will a successful rate on not just the United States but the world. Maybe people should actually look and promote the idea to see if it will help our economy and or environment. Without cars polluted cities will be able to breath fresh air and won't have to worry about payign for gas. Banning cars could be the best thing that will happen to the world.                          ",0
"Hey there! 

So, I know some people might be thinking, ""Ugh, a longer school day? No way, man! That's like, way too long!"" But hear me out. 

I think having a longer school day could be really beneficial for high school students. Like, think about it. We're already in school for like, eight hours a day, but sometimes it feels like we're not getting enough time to learn everything we need to know.  I mean, have you seen some of these kids' faces when they're trying to learn new stuff? It's like they're trying to drink from a firehose! 

So, if we had more time in school, we could actually learn more stuff. Like, imagine being able to get more help from teachers, or having more time to work on projects and stuff. It could be really great for our grades and stuff.  And who doesn't want better grades, right? 

But, I know some people might be thinking, ""But won't it be super annoying to be in school for longer? Like, won't we just be sitting around all day?"" And yeah, I get that.  But, think about it this way: if we have more time in school, we could actually have more fun. Like, imagine being able to play games or do cool projects during class. It could be like, a nice break from the usual boring stuff. 

And, I don't know about you guys, but I feel like I'm always forgetting stuff.  Like, I'll be in class and I'll be like, ""Oh no, I forgot to do that homework!"" Or, ""I forgot to study for that test!"" And it's just,  super frustrating. But, if we had more time in school, maybe we could actually remember stuff better. 

But, I guess there are some downsides too.  Like, some people might be like, ""Ugh, I don't want to be",1
"Most people might want to get rid of the Electoral College and change to popoular vote, because of how unfair, voters have no say so in who gets pick president.

One reason you might want to change to popular vote is because of how unfair they can be all because of the winner-takes-all system and this this system is in easch state, and because of that candidates dont spend time in states they know that wont vote for them. Just like you can't pick who you want your president to be.

Voters can't pick who they want their president to be its all the Electoral college. Voters don't even get to vote for the president thay vote for a slate of electors. just like if you live in Texas and you voted for Kerry you didnt vote for him you voted for 34 demcartic electors.

The only argument against the Electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. Americans should feel lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest problem election  in a century.

Given that most voters vote one party for president and another for congress they do this becaus ethis think a tie or deadlock will happen but, consider this. In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 voters would of dead locked the election yet in 1976 a tie would of happen but 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii voted the other way.

This right here is the most basic level the electoral college is unfair and should let the voters have their voice when voting.    ",0
"After research into the subject, it has become clear that requiring students to take classes such as art, music, or drama can have multiple drawbacks. Firstly, students may feel unmotivated or uninspired by the subject matter, leading them to skip classes, resulting in lower overall attendance and grades. Similarly, when a student is required to take a class they are not passionate about, their enthusiasm decreases and they become less interested in learning in general. This decreased interest in learning can affect a student's motivation levels in all classes. Therefore, when mandating classes such as art, music, or drama for all students, their overall grades, attendance, and motivation levels can suffer.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that adding one and a half extra hours to the school day for students could have both positive and negative consequences. While it may seem like a small change, it could have a significant impact on the academic performance, social development, and mental health of students.

On the positive side, adding extra time to the school day could provide students with more opportunities to learn and improve their academic performance. With more time, students could focus on their studies and complete their assignments more efficiently. Additionally, teachers could use the extra time to provide more individualized attention to students who need it. This could lead to higher grades, better test scores, and a more well-rounded education for students.

However, there are also potential negative consequences to consider. For many students, the extra time could lead to increased stress and burnout. With more time in school, students may feel like they have to work harder than ever before, which could lead to feelings of overwhelm and exhaustion. Additionally, some students may struggle to find a balance between their academic and extracurricular activities, leading to decreased participation in clubs and sports.

Furthermore, the extra time could also have a negative impact on the social development of students. With more time in school, students may spend less time interacting with their peers outside of the classroom. This could lead to decreased social skills, decreased empathy, and a lack of meaningful relationships with other students.

In conclusion, adding one and a half extra hours to the school day for students could have both positive and negative consequences. While it may provide more opportunities for learning and academic improvement, it could also lead to increased stress, burnout, and decreased social development. Therefore, any decision to add extra time to the school day should be carefully considered and based on a thorough analysis of the potential consequences.",1
"Technology that reads emotion? sounds like a crzy mad great thing huh? well let me tell you why I think its a bad idea for the rt community..

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author talks about this ""amazing"" technology that can read emotion from a 3D picture. The reason that I think the Technology is a bad thing is becasue yes its good that the technology can read emotion of paintings but its not at the same time.

Its not a good thing becasue thats the art of looking at the art, to figure the emotion out on your own, seeing the different emotions and seeing the anger or the confusion instead of having it told to you. thats the beauty of looking at the art and in my opinion the Technology ruins that beauty by telling the emotion.

thats why I think this new emotion reading technology is bad for the art community and isnt valueable.",0
"Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet and taking pictures. It cam across a picture that looked like a human face. Scientis then studied it for a while and said it was not a sign of life on Mars that it was just the way a landform in Mars was shapped. They then send it out to the people. The people start freaking out because they have the idea on thier minds that Mars might actually have life for us to live in.

On April 5, 1998 the MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. The photos proved that on Mars there was only landforms. Many people were unsatisfied with the new photos. In paragraph 8 it says, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. Mission conrollers looked again. On April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day on Cydonia Malin's team captured an extradinaryphoto using the camera's absolut mazimum resolution. On the picture it indetinfied that Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

In conclusion the photos the viking's took are not the face of anything. It is an ordinary photo of Mars landforms. Which were not 100% idenfied untill April 8,2001. Which proves that the photos are just landforms of Mars.",0
"So driverless cars are coming and what is your opinion on them? Do yo think they are a good thing? Do you think they are a bad thing. I'm here to tell you why I think driverless cars are a good thing for people.

First of all, speed limit would be followed by everyone. Usually people don't drive the speed limit. If driverless cars happen, then we can make them go the speed limit. I think going the actual speed limit will reduce car accidents.

Second of all, the person in the car could still take control of the vehicle if needed. This is a good thing because if a turn or park is to difficult for the car itself, then the driver can take control and do the obstacle for the car. This will prevent the car from malfunctioning.

Finally, I think it will make it easier on a lot of people. If someone is handicapped the car is there to just drive for them if they can't drive for a long time. I also personally think it will reduce accidents because of how fast you are going.

In conclusion, Driverless cars are coming and while there are downsides, I feel that positive overweighs the negative. That is why I am for driverless cars. Do you think they are good thing for people?",0
"In the modern world, technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives. While the limitation of physical contact between people may be considered a drawback of technology, it is not the only possible outcome. There are undeniable benefits to technological advancement, particularly in terms of reducing the amount of time needed to complete daily tasks and increasing our autonomy and convenience. 

One distinct advantage to technology is that it reduces the amount of time needed to complete mundane tasks. For example, the introduction of automated machines has drastically reduced the amount of time needed to manufacture products. Similarly, online banking services help people manage their finances faster through the convenience of automation. 

Not only does technology reduce the time spent on tasks, it also provides greater autonomy and convenience to people's lives. With the help of smartphones and other devices, people can access a plethora of information, meaning they have access to a host of tools and knowledge at the touch of a button. This makes tasks that would have otherwise been difficult or impossible not long ago significantly easier.

In conclusion, it is clear that technology can provide a substantial positive impact on people's lives. By reducing the amount of time required to do certain tasks and providing greater autonomy and convenience, technology has the potential to make life easier and simpler for everyone.",1
"Dear Florida state senator, In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries future.

The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable decisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.

Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!

All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final decision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress.",0
"Dear senator of state,

I think keeping Electoral colleges is a key benifit for this state and also this country. According to the article ""

Does the Electoral College work?

"",The founding fathers established this process in the constitution as compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by popular demand. The Electoral college process consits of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consits of 538 electors. A majority of electoral votes is required to elect the President. The passage also states that under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. for this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia,

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a ""Winner take all"" system that awards all electors for the winning of thhe Presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a Variation of the ""proportional representation"". After the presidental election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" lisiting all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate also declares the winning of the presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of electors each year.

The electoral college is widely regartded as an Anachronism, a non-democraric method of selecting the president that ought to be overruled by delcaring the canidant who recives the most votes the winner. each partt selects a trusted elector to vote for the parties nominee.    ",0
"There are advantages of limiting car usage, but not as much as you thought. According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother, when she had a car, she was always tense.

"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned that success often comes with setbacks and failures. However, it is important to never give up and to keep pushing forward, even when things get tough. In this essay, I will provide examples of people who have achieved success despite facing multiple failures before achieving their goal.

One of the most famous examples of perseverance through failure is the story of Thomas Edison. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb, but it took him over 1,000 attempts to get it right. He failed countless times, but he never gave up and continued to experiment until he finally succeeded. This shows us that even when we face multiple failures, we should never give up and should keep trying until we find a solution.

Another example of perseverance through failure is the story of J.K. Rowling. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected by multiple publishers before finally being accepted. However, Rowling did not give up and continued to write and refine her story until it became a best-seller. This shows us that even when our work is initially rejected, we should not give up and should continue to improve and refine our work until it is successful.

In addition to these examples, there are many other people who have achieved success despite facing multiple failures before achieving their goal. These include Oprah Winfrey, who faced numerous rejections before becoming a successful talk show host, and Michael Jordan, who faced numerous injuries and setbacks before becoming one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

Overall, these examples show us the importance of never giving up and of persevering through failure. Even when we face setbacks and failures, we should continue to push forward and never give up on our dreams. By doing so, we can achieve great success and make a positive impact on the world.",1
"I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities have benefits, mandating participation infringes on student choice and individual circumstances.

Not all students have the time, interest or ability to take part in extracurriculars. Some students must work part-time jobs or care for family members after school. Forcing these students to take part in activities could negatively impact their schoolwork, other responsibilities or health. Academics should be the top priority, and forcing extra burdens on students risks hindering their education. 

Extracurricular activities are best pursued voluntarily, based on personal interests and fit with one's schedule. When participation is mandatory, the activities may lose meaning and value for some students. Different people find fulfillment through various avenues - not everyone enjoys sports, for example. Mandating a one-size-fits-all approach disregards individuality.

Rather than requiring participation, the school would be better served strongly encouraging involvement and promoting the diverse options available. Explaining benefits like skill-building, community-building and resume-boosting could inspire more natural involvement for those who have the ability and desire. For those who genuinely cannot devote the time, exceptions should be considered. Overall student well-being and choice should take priority over a blanket rule.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities provide benefits, mandating participation infringes on student autonomy and circumstances. Allowing for voluntary involvement respectfully considers differing priorities and abilities among the student body. The principal's intention to promote engagement is understandable but a mandatory policy is not the most reasonable approach. I believe exceptions should be made and genuine student choice/fit respected.",1
"I think that we should totes transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy! First of all, fossil fuels are bad for the earth. They release greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change, and they're also finite, which means they'll eventually run out. Renewable energy, on the other hand, is clean and renewable, meaning it'll never run out.

One example of a renewable energy source is solar power. Solar panels can be installed on homes and buildings, and they use the sun's energy to generate electricity. This is a way better option than burning fossil fuels, which release harmful emissions into the air. Plus, solar panels can save people money on their electricity bills!

Wind power is another great option. Wind turbines can be set up in areas with strong winds, and they use the wind's energy to generate electricity. This is a great way to power homes and businesses, and it's also a clean source of energy.

Some people might argue that renewable energy is too expensive, but I think it's worth it. The cost of renewable energy is decreasing as technology improves, and it's better to invest in renewable energy than to continue relying on finite resources that are bad for the planet.

In conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a smart move. It's better for the earth, it's clean, and it's renewable. We should totes do it!",1
"No I don't agree with this decision and here are a few reasons why I disagree.

Some student may not have time for these activities. For example, if a student needs extra help or a tutor they will have less time to get the help they need to succeed. If the students are required to take these activities it will consume their time to learn. This will eventually cause their grades to drop and possibly fail classes.

Another reason is they will have less time with their family. Family is very important especially as a child, but extracurricular activities may give them less family time. If a student has is on a sports team and has late practices this will tire them and they will not get to interact with their family as much. Which may cause the student to be antisocial.

My final reason is the workload. Students already have tons of work to do but they will have even more with the extracurriculars .Some students may have so much work to do they can't really get it done. This work will continue to pile up and may cause unwanted feelings like stress and anxiety. This can mess up the mindset of the student and they may want to move to another school or drop out.

These are reasons why I disagree with extracurricular activities being required.",0
"The benefits of participating in extracurricular activities are numerous; not only do they provide students with an opportunity to practice real-world skills relevant to their fields of interest, they also bolster a student's overall educational experience, help foster creativity, and even increase a student's chances of obtaining employment upon graduation. However, one factor that should be considered when researching the impact of extracurricular activities on a student's grades is the amount of time they need to devote to the activity. The more time they take away from academic pursuits, the more likely it is to impact their grade-point average. This means that grades should factor into a student's ability to participate in activities, and they should be willing and able to balance their academic performance with their extra-curricular activities.",1
"Do you think we should put facial action coding system in our classroo? I think using technology to read the emotions expressions in a classroom is a good thing because it tells you where your students are bord in class, see if they are mad in class, and tell someone is tired in the classromm.

See if the someone is bord in class is a good thing because you can make the subject or class more fun. That will make the student pay more attention in class because they won't be messing or not paying attention in class any more. In paragraph 6 it says ""A classrom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored."" What they meant by that is the computer would put a different lesson than instead making the student do the lesson being bord or confussed. That will help a lot of students because they are gonna learn more and get good grades.

The facial action coding system could tell a person if they are tired because the computer can tell by their muscles. It will tell the teacher wich student is tired so they teacher can do something about it. It will help out a lot of the teachers from telling who's falling asleep.",0
"Limiting car usage has several benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. One of the major advantages is improved air quality and environmental health. As passage 1 notes, vehicles are a leading source of air pollution in many cities. They emit a variety of harmful gases and particles that can cause respiratory problems like asthma. By driving less and using alternatives like public transportation, biking, or walking, cities would see lowered emissions and clearer air. This would significantly boost public health outcomes over time. 

A second advantage outlined in passage 2 is reduced traffic congestion. Traffic jams waste everyone's time and cause unnecessary stress. They also release more pollutants into the busy city air. If fewer private vehicles clogged up roads and more people switched to other modes, there would be less congestion for those who still need to drive. Commutes and goods delivery could be more efficient. People may also save money on gas by avoiding slow traffic. Public transportation could move more reliably too with less competition on the streets.

Passage 3 discusses the economic and infrastructure benefits. Parking spaces and roads are extremely expensive for cities to build and maintain. With fewer cars needing accommodations, municipalities could allocate those funds elsewhere to improve transit, bike lanes, or public services. Individuals may save substantial costs in the long run without owning a private vehicle for every trip. Financial resources are better spent on more sustainable options. 

In conclusion, limiting car usage through behavioral changes, urban design, and policy would lead to an array of ecological, social, and economic advantages according to the sources. Improved public health and reduced congestion are compelling outcomes. By raising awareness of these benefits, more citizens may be motivated to adopt multi-modal transportation habits for the betterment of communities overall. A shift away from complete car dependence can deliver positive results if implemented thoughtfully and progressively over time.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, making wise decisions is an essential skill that will benefit me in the future. In order to make wise decisions, I have done research on various methods that can help me make informed choices.

One way to make wise decisions is to gather as much information as possible before making a choice. This means researching the topic thoroughly and considering all of the possible outcomes. Additionally, seeking guidance from experts in the field can provide valuable insight and help me make more informed decisions.

Another way to make wise decisions is to weigh the pros and cons of each option. This can help me to identify the potential consequences of each decision and make a choice that is best for me.

Making bad decisions can have serious consequences, both for myself and for those around me. For example, a poor decision could lead to financial difficulties or damage relationships with friends and family. It is important to understand the potential consequences of each decision and to make choices that will have a positive impact on my life and the lives of those around me.

Decisions can also influence personal growth. By making choices that challenge me and push me out of my comfort zone, I can learn new skills and develop as a person. Additionally, by reflecting on my past decisions and the outcomes of those choices, I can make more informed decisions in the future.

Finally, seeking guidance from an expert can be incredibly beneficial. Experts have specialized knowledge and experience that can provide valuable insight and help me make more informed decisions. Additionally, seeking guidance can help me to identify potential pitfalls and avoid making mistakes that could have serious consequences.

"Dear Principal,

I am writing to express my thoughts about the potential new policy that would require students to have at least a grade B average to participate in school sports and activities. I think it would be a bad idea because it could have negative effects on students who are struggling to keep up their grades.

Firstly, many students may not be able to participate in sports or activities if this policy is put in place. This could cause a decrease in the number of students participating in these activities, which is not good for the school. It is important to encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities as it can help improve their overall well-being and social skills.

Furthermore, some students may feel discouraged and unmotivated to improve their grades if they are not given the opportunity to participate in sports or activities. These activities can be a great way for students to release stress and improve their mood, which can lead to better academic performance.

On the other hand, some students may argue that having a minimum grade requirement would motivate students to work harder and improve their grades. However, I believe that this policy may cause students to cheat on tests or homework assignments to meet the minimum requirement.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the proposed policy would have more negative effects than positive effects on the students. Therefore, I urge you to reconsider this policy change and find alternative ways to motivate students to improve their grades.

Thank you for your consideration,

"""The more technology we have the more knowledge we loose. The more technology we have the more lazy we get."" Cars could fundamentaly change the world. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both postive and negative aspects of driveless cars. Driverless cars have a more negative aspect than a positive aspect because it can cause many accidents, they're expensive and they are too smart.

Driverless cars are faster than any other car ,a lot of people are facinated with them but the fact that these cars can steer, accelerate and brake themselves can cause many accidents. These driveless cars dont drive through work zones and around accidents. The car will require the human's attention whenever there's a problem. if the techonology fails whose fault is it? the drive or the manufacturer?

One of the biggest concerns about driveless cars is that they're really expensive baecause they have many expensive sensors;sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camara mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors and a GPS. imagine how much all of these things could cost? very expensive and what if one day you wake up and the car doesnt work? imagine how expesive it is going to be to fix it.

Lastly, Driveless cars are too smart. They have a very advanced technology. They have all thse sensors and too much technology can be very dangerous for humans, tis technology is not nessesary for hiumans.

in Conclusion, Driveless cars can be very dangerous but a a lot people would love to buy them just for the simply fact that it can be more practical, that way the dont have to drive to store if they dont want to or to their jobs or even to another state. There is only four states that have approved the use of this cars. Manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars proved more reliably safe.",0
"Electoral college should be banned. Many people say that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close elction in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. So let me give you some facs about why electoral college should be banned.

Furthermore,Another reason why electoral college should be banned is because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kery.

For Instance,Another reason why electoral college should be banned is because legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people back in 1960,.Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

In Conclusion,I think electoral college should be banned because its unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. So this is why electoral college should be banned.                                                                                                                                                                                                              ",0
"""I have nothing to do after school,"" cried Generic_Name,""I'm gonna be so bored."" ""You should tryout for soccer!"" exclaimed Generic_Name. Generic_Name wasn't keen on the thought of trying out for soccer. ""I mean, I'm not very athletic, and I don't have very good foot eye coordination."" Generic_Name said wearily. ""That's okay. Just try it, you never know, you might enjoy it."" Generic_Name said, trying to motivate Generic_Name. Confidently, Generic_Name responded with, ""Okay, I'll try it."" All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.

To start with, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them make new friends. This is important because it can help a student who struggles socially. For example, say that you don't make friends very well. Joining a sport or a club will help you find someone who shares the same interests as you. Another reason is that it will help students become close with students that aren't in their grade. For instance, almost all school activities are open to all grades. This is the only time students will be able to socialize with the grades above or below them. So it's important that they take advantage of it. Lastly, it's important that students make new friends because it can help them become more involved in school activities. To emphasize, I ran track my eighth grade year. My friends motivated me to tryout. I ended up loving it and making so many new friends with sixth and seventh graders.

Secondly, requiring students to join a school activity will keep them busy. To start of with, when students are done with their homework they immediately go on their phone. To fix this problem, keeping students busy with a sport or a club will prevent them from being on their phone to much. Moreover, so many kids complain of being bored and not having anything to do after school. This is because they're not busy. To support my opinion, during track season I never complained of not having anything to do. I was always occupied either with homework or I was at practice. The last reason why it's important to keep students busy is because it gives them the opportunity to practice their time management skills. To illustrate, at the beginning of track season I was very stressed about how I was going to complete all my homework. By the end of the season I knew how to manage all my time and didn't have to stress on how I was going to finish my homework.

Finally, requiring students to participate in a club or sport gets students get out of their comfort zone. Getting students' out of their comfort zone is important because it prepares them for the work force. To elaborate, in the work force you don't get a choice whether or not you do something. You have to do it, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Another reason is that putting yourself out of your comfort zone can make you grow into a more confident person. For instance, I joined MAC committee when I was in eighth grade. Talking in front of a whole class made me uncomfortable. Now that I look back at it, it was worth it. I'm so much more confident as a person.

Another reason is that getting out of your comfort zone can change your point of view. To illustrate, my friend's parents forced him to join the art club. At first he thought it was weird and only for the ""geeks"". Joining the art club changed his whole point of view. He now loves art and wants to pursue it as a career.

""This is so fun!"" Generic_Name exclaimed, as she kicked the soccer ball. ""I told you, all you had to do was get out of your comfort zone."" Generic_Name responded. ""Yeah, you were right. I'm so happy that you encouraged me to do this. I've made so many new friends and found out I really enjoy playing soccer."" Generic_Name agreed, ""Me too. Soccer keeps me busy and off my phone."" In conclusion, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.",0
"Phones & Driving

Do you use your phone while you're driving? Or do you be in the car with people who use their phone while they're driving? I believe we should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.

Emergencies always happen on the road. It ranges from wrecks to flat tires. People always need road side assistance. Without a phone how would you call 911 if someone have a wreck and need assistance right away? Things always happen when you're on the road, you can only control the way you drive. Not the way others drive.

Most people don't know there way round the whole entire world. It's not fun to be lost. So directions is the key to stay on track. We don't want to stop people on the road to keep asking them questions. You may say ""Why not just use a map""? Maps are confusing for some people. Not everyone is like that though some people rather go old fashion. Also some people might not have extra money to buy a car GPS. If you have an app on your phone for free, why pay money out your pocket?

Weather is important while you're driving. Some weather be to savior to drive in. So checking it frequently is important. Weather can cause accidents and everything. How else you're going to check it while traveling? The radio may tell you but what if you miss, what you are going to do then?

"Phones and Driving

The use of phones has grown tremendously to the point that people feel as if they can't survive without them. It's bad to know that our phones are becoming more and more of our lives and that people can't take their attention off of them for minutes while they are on the road. I personally don't think people should be able to use phones while driving because it delays everything as in the way people drive how they are at stop lights and all of that. Many bad things have come from people driving and texting so I dont think it should happen that people can excess phones while driving.

There are many delays when people are on their phones. If they drive you can pretty much tell if they are on them because, it will show they will sit at the stop light longer even after the light turns green and they drive slower. You have to remember to when you are driving like this it puts others at risk of kids if they are playing and you don't see them because you are on the phone it will put them at danger if you do something. A lot of drivers that do this don't think of it as a risk because it benefits them but it truly is because, its putting every one in danger including them because their attention is altered and the person in front of them may make a sudden change.

I was looking at a document and it said that texting and driving is comparable to drinking under the influence if not worse and I could see that because when they are on the phone they swerve and slow down and their attention isn't on the road at all. People who are texting while driving are 23% more likely to crash their cars. This percentage is equivalent to that of the average person who has drunk four beers and then began to operate a car which is scary because, I am on the road pretty much everyday and to know that these people are out there too is terrible. If phones are worse than drinking I feel that it should be illegal to be on your phone while driving because, it is illegal to drink and drive so this should be too.

In conclusion, I don't agree with being on your phone while driving is right and it should be banned. A lot of bad outcomes can come from a person being on their phone. It's very sad to think about what could happen. People have kids and still drive with them for example my cousin does it and it's sad that she can put her selfish needs to the side for one minute to focus on the road so her and her baby can get to where they need to go safely. My mom always says I think about myself and others which is good because I always analyze everything for everyone and I want everyone to be good so if I need to get off my phone for a few mins for a safer drive I am fine with that.

"Today, most students attend public and private schools; however, there are a small amount of students who attend online school at home. Online school is often used for those with large commitments such as, sports and the arts. Sometimes parents enroll their children into online school just because they want to. However, students would not benefit from attending classes from home because it limits their social skills, influences procrastination, and the opportunity to cheat on assignments.

When classes are being taken online, students are isolated from others making it harder for them to practice their social skills. This does not benefit them in any type of way; especially, if the student doesn't do any activities outside of the house. Social skills are important in the real world because they help people find jobs and survive in society. In order to receive a job, a person has to talk to the interviewer and if they're nervous, then they don't receive the job. Without social skills students are not benefiting from taking online classes.

Not only will students lack social skills, but they will begin to procrastinate. Students are more likely to procrastinate at home because they have unlimited access to their phones and video games. Today, some students who attend public and private schools already procrastinate enough when they are at home, and with the luxury of being at home all the time, this will easily take into effect. Due to the fact that these students are always home, they will continuously procrastinate because they have the ability to cheat using the internet. With this in their mind, they will create this continuous cycle of procrasination and cheating.

Leading into the next point, online school is not beneficial because it makes students believe that they can cheat. Since students who are taking online school are already using technology, it makes it easier to cheat. They have easy access to search engines such as, Google and Bing; making it easy to search up answers for their assignments. Students also have the ability to communicate with others taking the same class as them, and allowing them to exchange answers. When students cheat it does not benefit them in one way or another.

Some may say that parents set up restrictions against their students, but most parents are busy with work or running errands.

Attending online class is not beneficial to students. This is because it makes them to be socially awkward , which will lead to giving up job; procrastinating and play video games all day; and cheating on every assignment they and not learn anything. if you think about attending online classes, think about how much your work ethic may be.",0
"By being allowed to design their own summer projects, students are afforded significantly many more opportunities to learn outside of the classroom and are also able to accomplish their project with a degree of flexibility, letting them both enjoy their time off but also retain information that they learned the previous year.

Many students have quite the chaotic schedule during the summer months. Between jobs, internships, and trying to enjoy their time away from school, it's easy for teacher-assigned work to get tossed by the wayside during this time. Additionally, for some people it is difficult to do things like hop online and complete lessons or sit down with a calculator and figure out equations, since their schedules simply don't allow it. This can be a problem for anyone who participates in programs such as Outward Bound or those who will spend a few weeks in another country on vacation or in the middle of nowhere building houses with their church.

By letting their summer work be student-driven, kids will be able to adapt their commitments to their teacher's desire to have them continue their learning over the break and not have to worry about finishing assignments by deadlines that they already know aren't possible for them to meet. For example, if a student is going to Latin America over the summer, instead of having them mindlessly conjugate verbs on worksheets to submit for their Spanish class, they can actually put what they learned to use out in the world by talking with locals or taking in the culture through music and food. If another student doesn't happen to have a passport and a couple thousand dollars lying around, they can adjust it to their situation, for example going to a local Latin grocery store and buying ingreedients in Spanish in order to make a native dish.

However, the opportunities extend beyond just languages and cultures. If a student is interning at a company in a different city, they have to learn a variety of skills, one of which being how to budget correctly. Here, they can employ what they learned in their math class in order to help them out with their finances by figuring out how much things will cost and what percentages of their money will have to go to which necessity. Again, this applies to everyone, as students who don't have that opportunity still get the chance to apply their math abilities to their own lives, as they might want to figure out how to divide up their paychecks from their summer job between spending and saving money.

These examples highlight another main benefit of letting students design their own summer projects, that being the increased opportunities that are availible outside of the classroom. Instead of having one general project assigned by the teacher that is monotonus and isn't any different than regular school, students can customize their learning to their specific situation and access things that aren't availible inside the classroom. Students that are interested in making music can apply for internships at music studios that have nicer equipment than their school. Students that enjoy writing can work with local journalists and get a feel for what writing is like for a bigger publication than just their school paper.

One might be thinking at this point, ""Come on now. This is great for all the kids who are motivated to learn and are enough of a go-getter to go out and do this stuff, but what about the ones who just want to sit inside and play video games or hang out with their friends?"" This is where the real beauty of student-designed work comes in. Even those who don't want to have to sacrifice their precious three months of freedom can still get in valuable time applying what they learned the previous school year. Spend your summer days inside playing video games? Calculate your win rate or determine your average time taken to complete certain levels. Prefer to hang out with your buddies at the pool all day? Determie your arc in the air doing different tricks off the diving board. The ability to adapt one's schedule to their situation is infinitely better than doing some general assignment handed out by a teacher, for all types of people.

If students can create their own project that is specific to their life over the summer, then they are accomplishing several goals. It allows them to actually get the work done, instead of being unable to do so based off of their schedule. It lets them be interested in their learning instead of complaining about a boring stack of worksheets that that have to robotically complete. Most importantly, however, it gives them the chance to experience things outside of the classroom that are both personalized to their lives and also accomplishing their teacher's goal of getting them to continue to learn information, ensuring that student-designed projects present the best of both worlds.",0
"After researching the partnerships, local companies, and organizations associated with my school, I discovered many activities associated with each of them. For example, the local theater company offers volunteer opportunities, while the art museum provides educational outreach programs to the community. Additionally, each of these entities offers a unique workplace environment. The theater company has a relaxed and creative atmosphere, while the art museum has a more formal and professional environment. I must now consider which type of workplace would be the best fit for my interests and preferences.",1
"The Seagoing Cowdays program is a good program if you like spending weeks at a time on a boat.

"Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it has brought about significant changes in the way we live, work, and interact with each other. While technology has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks. In this essay, we will explore both the positive and negative implications of technology on people's lives.

On the positive side, technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and access information. With the advent of social media, we can connect with people from all over the world, share our thoughts and ideas, and stay in touch with our loved ones. Technology has also made it easier for us to work remotely, which has led to increased flexibility and work-life balance. Additionally, technology has made it possible for us to access vast amounts of information quickly and easily, which has led to increased knowledge and education.

However, technology has also had negative implications on people's lives. One of the most significant drawbacks of technology is that it can cause people to forget how to truly live life. With the constant bombardment of notifications, messages, and emails, people often find themselves glued to their screens, missing out on the beauty of the physical world. Technology can also lead to a feeling of inadequacy and depression. Social media can create unrealistic standards and comparisons, leading people to feel inadequate and unhappy with their lives.

Another negative implication of technology is that it can have an adverse effect on people's physical and mental health. Spending too much time on screens can lead to eye strain, headaches, and poor posture. It can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Additionally, technology can cause people to become isolated and disconnected from others, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.

Despite these negative implications, people can use technology in a productive way to better their lives. For example, technology can be used to track and monitor our health and fitness, helping us make better choices and improve our overall well-being. Technology can also be used to learn new skills and pursue our passions, whether it's through online courses, tutorials, or creative projects.

In conclusion, technology has both positive and negative implications on people's lives. While it has brought about significant changes and benefits, it",1
"The American school system is unfortunately still on the fall-late spring school schedule, leaving students their summer out of school. Although all students would likely agree that this off-time is beneficial, the majority of students experience a 'summer slide' where they lose knowlede they have gained in the past year, and get out of the habit of learning. As a remedy to this, especially in higher level grades, schools assign summer projects in order to help students maintain the mindset of learning. How these summer assignments should be designed is very important to how the students use their knowledge during their break. If students designed the project, they would likely find the projects more enjoyable, but risk not actually learning much in the process. On the other hand, teacher-designed assignments may cause students to lose interest and not work their hardest on their project. Therefore, I think that a teacher designed, but creative assignment, would be most beneficial to students' learning curve over the summer. By assigning something creative with educational merit, students would enjoy working during their free time, learn new things, and prevent losing knowledge they have gained while they are on their summer vacation.

Having fun with assignments is an essential part in keeping young students interested in school, particularly when they are on a break. If a student is assigned something they find boring, they are less likely to try as hard as they would on a more creative assignment. Also, if the assignment is more open to interpretation, it helps students think more creatively. Students would be much more likely to complete, and better yet, enjoy assignments that they find creative and fun. Meanwhile, a student with a duller assingment would not put their entire effort into it, and would surely rather be enjoying their vacation. By making the assignment itself more enjoyable, students would be 10 times more interested and likely to enjoy it.

Though the creativity of the assingment is paramount, the educational value of the assignment is just as important. By having teachers design summer projects, this assures that the students will gain or keep their educational mindset and knowledge throughout their summer vacation. It's important that teachers do the designing of the project in order to guarentee that students are actually learning something through completing this project. Teachers should, however, consider the input of students while they are designing it, in order to make it more enjoyable and interesting for them, not just a boring assignment.

In order to make sure that students can actually enjoy their projects, leaving it open to some interpretation can help a diverse set of students come up with individual ideas for their assignment. This would make it more interesting for everyone involved, and would also prevent students from copying each others' work, as well as helping them nourish their creativeness while they are out of school.

By making summer assignments creative, but still educational, teachers can prevent students from getting out of the educational mindset over their break, as well as help them enjoy their work as much as they enjoy their time out of school. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, but still have room for creative and original ideas that will help the students enjoy their work and their individuality as they complete their summer work.",0
"Dear Principle,

I support your idea that students should have atleast a C average in order to join after school sports and clubs. My reason for this is that I think by having a reward for getting passing grades students would try harder to do well in school. Secondly I also think it would help teams to do better at a sport since they would have people on the team who would be dedicated to what they are doing since they worked so hard to get on there. Also students will help their friends do better in school if they can both join the same club or sport. This would teach students how to study and be responsible. Most importantly this would give extra curricular activities some meaning since students will be interested in what they joined and will try hard to achieve everything thing can in it.

Thank you for you're time,

Sincerely ,STUDENT_NAME",0
"Character is often said to define who we are as individuals, but should we choose these traits for ourselves or be shaped and molded by outside forces? There is much debate surrounding this issue, and it is important to consider both sides before making a decision.

On the one hand, there are those who believe that character traits should be chosen independently. Self-determination allows us to make our own decisions, and makes us agents of change in our own lives. Moreover, it also allows us to establish our values and follow our own moral compass. By taking this approach, we can be assured that our character is shaped by the person we decide to be. An example of this can be seen in the way people choose to use their resources in different ways to achieve certain goals.

On the other hand, it is argued that character traits should be shaped, in part, by outside influences. External experiences, both good and bad, can shape and influence our character. Culture, family, and other external influences can all contribute to our values and way of life. Proponents of this approach argue that these experiences are necessary in order to help shape and refine our character. An example of this is how people from different cultures have varying perspectives on certain issues.

Ultimately, it is up to us to decide how our character is shaped and molded. We have the freedom of choice and the power to change the course of our lives. We can support positive external influences while maintaining our own autonomy and individuality. As long as we make conscious decisions about our character traits, we can shape our lives in a way that is best for us.

In conclusion, when it comes to our character traits, we have the power to determine our own destiny. We can draw from the values of those that have influenced us, or we can create our own unique character and determine our own fate. It is up to us to decide which approach is best for our lives, and we have the freedom to choose our own character traits.",1
"Technology is a tool for the human to amuse because people can check out books,shop, and play games without speaking to another person, but at the same time technology effects on people's lives. Here are some negative and positive reasons that technology cause to the people.

Many people lost their time with play games, for example, 75% of childhood and young play games every day thats means that more than 1 million of kids take their time with games, so the consequence of the future of this generation can be different because right know children's starts to loss communication with parents or starts to be aggressive with others. thats a negative reason.

Now, technology helps a lot because makes more easy on people's lives. for example, During the time technology creased every day, exist apps that you can use for jobs and apps that you can use to contact others easier. On this times young people study about photograph, edition, effects, agriculture and more because that is the feature, but we need to be careful because if we carelessness the future can be horror.

The technology is too important for the world. There is positive reasons and negative reasons it just depends what you care more, Technology or the world, and i'm not saying that we need to eliminated the technology. I'm just thing that we need to be care for this if we want a good feature, So one thing we can do is to get more communicate, friendship, share with people, go outside, visit the nature. If we still do those things our feature will be pretty good.

To conclude, Technology is a tool for the human to amuse, It's depends how we used. in the positive way or wrong way.",0
"Why do people ask multiple people for their opinion? Shouldn't they just trust one opinion? People sometimes ask for multiple opinions to help them with a tough decision. It can be difficult to make choices for yourself sometimes. You can give someone advice, but they would ask other people what they thought too. Seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial to a person making a decision because it gives them more options, multiple points of view, and helps them make the best decision.

The more options the better when it comes to making choices. When people ask for advice from multiple people, they get more options of what they could do. Having more options is better for the person trying to make to choice. For example, if Generic_Name asks me for my advice on which running event she should do. I might say the two-hundred meter, but Generic_Name might say the one-hundred meter. After we both give her our opinion she has to choose. It it important to get more options before making choices. The more options people have the better choice they can make for them self.

When people have a decision they need to hear other peoples advice. If the person making the choice doesn't ask other people for advice they will follow what they think is right, even if it is wrong. The person making the choice would think it is right because that is their side of it, but if they ask other people they will see more than their side, and might not follow their own advice because they realized it was wrong. The person only realized they were wrong when they asked the other person for advice. Also when a person ask other people for advice they see what other people would think of them depending on the choice they make. When people see what other people would think of them sometimes it influence the decision that they make. When they ask for advice it shows them more points of view.

When people ask multiple people for advice they get more options and more points of view, but it also helps them make the best choice possible. When people ask for advice it shows them that their first choice might not have been the best. it also helps them get more options, so that they can make the wisest choice of what they should do. It can be difficult for a person the choose what they think is best for them, but the advice that is given to them really helps them make the best choice. People should always ask for multiple opinions before making a choice because it is very beneficial to them as they make the choice. Asking for multiple opinions will help the person make the best choice.

In conclusion, it is important for people to ask for advice before making a decision. Asking for multiple opinions is helpful for many reasons. The advice they are given will give them more options of what to do, show them more points of view, and it will help them make the choice that will benefit them the most. When someone asks you for advice try to give them advice that will benefit them the very most. It is important for them to get good advice to make the best possible decision. That is why people ask for multiple opinions as they try to make important decisions.       ",0
"My opinion on driverless cars, i think it would be a stupid idea because i love to drive and im sure there are alot of other people who love to drive. Driverless cars could be a big problem, what if a driverless car had a malfunction and could wreck and kill somebody. Im sure the goverment would disagree with this idea because they love to make money, and all the money to make driverless cars would be outrageous, and that could make the goverment go in dept and it could ruin alot of things.

No details support my position because im against it, like i said i love to drive and i wanna be able to go wherever i want in the future and not have to worry about not having my own car because driverless cars just sound stupid. What if these driverless cars have a malfunction and just took off on its own i wanna be able to have my own car and drive on my own, because what if i end p getting a audi gr im sure ill be the one wanting to drive by myself and like i said everyone loves driving so i really dont like the idea.

These people who make the driverless cars such as nissan and audi, how do they know they can even make these cars to where it wont wreck on its own, or get us to where we need to go, the only thing i think would be cool about it is if i am tired and im driving and i need to go to sleep and the car could drive on its own, but what if a deer jumped in front of the car and the car is going 60 mph the car isnt just going to stop your going to wreck. If they really wanna make these cars they need to have good protection like a tank or sometin because that would be safe. Im still against it but it would be pretty cool to see what they can really do in the future.      ",0
"greenhouse gasses have always been a problem that riddled america and also politics, but many other countrys are limiting their usage of cars. paris even made there be specific days where people will keep their cars at home or be fined. paris is among the most densley polluted citys on earth, and they thought it might be good for everybody to take a break from polluting the city and maybe breath easy for a few days. almost 4,000 drivers were fined a total of 31 dollars (US) and 27 people had their cars impounded because they were upset about the fines. Its nice to see a country actually care about what it is doing to the enviroment, but it might take something big for other countrys to follow suit.

president obamas ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse emmissions, unveiled last week ,will geta fortuitous assist from an incipent shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that america is buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer liscenses as years go by. that has left researchers pondering a fundamental question:has america passed peak driving? the united states with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the worlds prime car cultures. it is the birth place of the model T; the home of detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""mustang sally"" just kidding im not gonna copy all of that. but really america has cut down on the use of cars and we should be proud.

"Mandatory participation in at least one extracurricular school activity is a fantastic concept. Doing this in schools will have many positive impacts on students. It will help students develop relationships. It will improve overall daily life for students. It will also give the students an opportunity to practice useful life skills.

Making students participate in an extracurricular activity will help allow the students to build relationships. Through the extracurricular school activity, students would have a new way to meet people. Through the club or sport the students would also have built in time to spend with these people to make meaningful connections. Meeting people this way would also not carry nearly as much social anxiety because students would already have a common interest.

These mandatory extracurricular school activities will also help to improve the daily life of students. The club or sport that the student chooses to participate in would provide something to look forward to after school. These activities would provide a light at the end of the tunnel for students. These activities would also positively impact student's daily lives because they would get to participate in an activity they enjoy on a regular basis. A sense of community would also be built between students who participate in the club. Overall all of those things would improve student's mental health and lives.

These extracurricular clubs and sports would also give students an opportunity to practice important life skills. These activities would give students a chance to practice working together. The extracurricular clubs and sports would also give students a platform where they could practice and improve their leadership skill. Because other students would be in the extracurricular activities it would also give students an outlet to practice general social skills. All of these skills will be incredibly useful and important to the students going forward in their lives.

As you can see, mandatory extracurricular activities in schools would greatly benefit students. These activities would give students an opportunity to build relationships. It would also help to improve their,the students, daily lives. These clubs and sports would also provide an opportunity for students to practice important life skills. These mandatory activities would have a positive impact that would ripple throughout the entire school.      ",0

"Studying Venus may be an great idea to the author and it may be very needed.

Venus seems to have had some type intrest to some people such as the author who suggested studying the planet even if it means harming yourself should be acceptable.

The author believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is close to Earth and many don't really know this because Venus isn't talked about as much as it should be. The planet was descibed in the reading and the description seemed like it would may be an good idea to study Venus as it states in the text descibing Venus and I quote "" The planet has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,moutains, and craters"" this description gives you an inside view of how Venus looks on the inside.

Although many don't really think about Venus it's a very important planet and the author listed some very good pointers to think about that'll make you want to look more into the planet. The author stated and I quote

"" Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet"" the author believes that Vensus was once like earth and he thinks looking more into Venus can solve some unanswered concerns. There is a maybe that Venus may have had an ocean there as it states in the text "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" this states that it seems to be life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus before beacuse of what their observing then studying Venus might not be so bad and the author may be right that despiting dangers studying Vensus is a good idea.

Studying Venus after all may not be a bad thing after all. The author gave many details and explained a lot about Venus that some mahy have never known about Venus. Venus is an over looked planet everybody knows of the planet Venus but nobody really knows the history behind the planet. The author explained that Venus seemed familiar and seems as if he's been there before. Venus looks much like Earth as if a human once lived there before as descibed in the passage. It seems like Venus is worth risking something dangerous happening to you just to study it because the author suggested it meaning he's down for what it takes to study this planet the right way.

In conclusion the author suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how committed he is on studying the planet. The author suggested that looking past all of the dangers that comes with studying Venus is a good thing to do because there may have been life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus then studying the planet may give the people studying the planet some good informantion to back up their assumption of human living on the planet long ago.",0
"The more the better ! Getting Advice from many people is something that every person has do at least once. Getting advice from many people can help you get a different perspective, it can help you in the future,and it can help the community.

Having a different perspective is really good . When you have a different perspective of something you might have a better adtuided . Let's say you fail a test and you have a really bad adtuided and you asked many people what could you do to help and what they say can make you feel better which causes you to have a better a adtuided. Having different perspective also gives you different opinion. I believe that having different opinions is something you should always consider because you most likely will hear the same thing and you might like what they say but you might hear something different and you might like it even more. Having a different perspective can not only give the situation a better perspective but it can also give you a different perspective. Hear me out not only can other peoples perspective give the situation a different point of view but yourself as well. I believe that having advice from many people can really help you have a better perspective, adtuided,and understanding.

Advice from more then one person can help your future. As you grow up you will release that you start to ask for more and more advice. I think the more you ask for advice the more you are most likely to be successful in your future. Advice that is given to you now will help you your whole life. For example my teacher once told me that not understanding how to do something is okay because from that is how we learn from it. The advice given to you is something you will pass down . I think that it's amazing how much advice form who know how long ago has come so far. Advice can help you in the future by developing more and more,remembering it though your life,and pass it on to other generations.

Advice also helps the community. It is proven that when advice is given the community becomes better. I believe that the community can become better when given advice. Part of becoming a better community is teaching others how they can become better. I think that this can be done with giving others advice. When advice is spread form person to person it spreads form community to community and then it spreads from state tot state and eventually the world. Advice needs to be spread all over the world and to make all our communities a better place. Advice can not only impact the community but the world as well

Asking for opinions from more then one person can help you see different opinions,help you later in life, and help the world. Advice can help to see different points of view, help you in your ,and help our community become better. In conclusion I believe that getting advice can help having different perspective and help the community.                 ",0

"Dear principal,

I have choose to write you a letter about why we should have school sports. Well first off you said ""That you are considering to change school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless the have at least B average"". well personally you can do any sports with a GPA of 2.5. i would think that would be fair because you should know that many people are not that smart at school but really good in sports. So now i say that you should base it on a group class so in their view class you have them take a test. and in that test you say"" okay this test is to see how well you do. so lets just say that there is only a couple of kids who well don't very well then you say okay since a couple of you didn't do very this is what we are going to do we are going to combine all the kids test so all 30 test and we are going to average them. Which mean every body has a good chance and then if that doesn't work. than that is when that hard parts come. so what you do then is say if you really want to do this sport than you have to work for. that means after school you have to work on that class. and get help find some one or a book that can help you. So that way you can have some good grades. So then lets just say that you do that every day. And you make it on the team. then what its going to be practice every day for the team. take the skills you learn form your after school help and use them .so that way you can go home take a shower and go study for that big test you have. but really it should be actually a C because C is average. and B is above average. so if you have a B then you should but if you have a C then you should work as hard as you can to get a B so that way you can play safe and have fun well doing what you love the most working hard and choosing the best way to success.

Well i guess you should say ""what about P.E. well i guess if you have P.E. then you should have sports to. because P.E. is like a sport to. you run you do all these kinds of work out and it is just like sports. so in other words P.E. is just like sports.

" Many students have various reasons for not attending school, such as illness, appointments, or natural disasters in their neighborhood. These reasons can lead to a loss of school days, which can ultimately affect a student's grade and even their ability to graduate on time. As a result, it is important for schools to offer distance learning options to help students avoid losing school days and maintain their grades.

One reason why distance learning is important is that students may become sick and unable to attend school. This can happen to anyone, and it can be particularly challenging for students with special needs who may need to be in the hospital for an extended period. In addition, students with allergies may be affected by changes in the weather, which can make it difficult for them to attend school. Distance learning allows these students to continue their education from home, without missing out on valuable class time.

Another reason why distance learning is important is that students in their neighborhood may experience natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, or earthquakes. These events can make it difficult for students to get to school, either because the roads are closed or because the school bus is unable to reach their neighborhood. Distance learning allows these students to continue their education from the safety of their homes, without missing out on valuable class time.

In addition to these reasons, distance learning can also be beneficial for students who are struggling with their grades. By allowing students to learn at their own pace, distance learning can help them catch up on missed class time and improve their grades. This can be particularly important for students who are at risk of repeating a year or failing to graduate on time.

Of course, there are those who argue that distance learning may not be the best solution for all students. Some may argue that students who are used to attending school in person may struggle with the lack of structure and social interaction that comes with distance learning. However, it is important to remember that distance learning is just one tool that schools can use to help students stay on track and maintain their grades. By offering distance learning options alongside traditional classroom instruction, schools can provide students with the support they need to succeed, no matter what challenges they may face.

In conclusion, distance learning is an important tool that schools can use to help students avoid losing school days and maintain their grades. Whether it's due to illness, appointments, natural disasters, or struggling grades, distance learning",1

"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance versus making your own decisions. In today's world, it is easy to rely on technology and social media to make decisions, but it is important to consider the values and life matters that are most important to you.

The first step in making an informed decision is to understand the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance. Seeking guidance from experts can provide a fresh perspective on a situation, as well as access to knowledge and resources that may not be available to you. Additionally, seeking guidance can help you avoid making decisions that may have negative consequences, such as financial or legal issues.

The second step in making an informed decision is to list the values and life matters that are most important to you. For me, my values include honesty, integrity, and respect for others. These values are important to me because they guide my actions and help me make decisions that align with my personal beliefs. Additionally, my life matters most to me include my family, friends, and my education. These are important to me because they provide a sense of belonging and purpose in my life.

The third step in making an informed decision is to compare making your own decisions to seeking guidance from experts. While making your own decisions can be empowering and provide a sense of autonomy, it can also be risky and lead to negative consequences. On the other hand, seeking guidance from experts can provide a sense of security and help you avoid making decisions that may have negative consequences. However, it is important to note that seeking guidance should not replace making your own decisions, as it is important to develop your own skills and independence.

In conclusion, making your own decisions is important for you as it allows you to develop your own skills and independence. Additionally, understanding the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance can help you make informed decisions that align with your values and life matters. It is important to find a balance between making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts, as both have their own unique benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, the key to making informed decisions is to understand your own values and life matters, and to seek guidance when necessary.",1
"The impact of having a positive attitude on achieving success in life has long been recognized. Research has revealed numerous examples of individuals who have achieved success through adopting a positive attitude. For example, Marie Curie, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist and chemist, persevered despite facing discrimination and other challenges as a woman in a male-dominated field. Her positive attitude enabled her to overcome the obstacles she encountered and to achieve great success in her career. 

In contrast, having a negative attitude can have serious implications for achieving success in life. Negative thinking can make it difficult to set goals, and it can lead to feelings of discouragement or hopelessness. Studies have shown that a positive attitude can provide benefits such as increased motivation and resilience, even during challenging times. 

Overall, having a positive attitude can be an asset in achieving success in life. It can allow individuals to focus on the possibilities rather than the limitations they may encounter. A positive attitude can help drive individuals to push through difficult times and to make the most of their opportunities.",1
"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy. I believe that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, which is Policy 1.

Firstly, cell phones can be very useful in case of emergencies. If a student needs to contact their parents or guardians quickly, having a cell phone at hand can help them do that easily. This is especially important in cases where a student might need to leave school early or in the event of an emergency.

Secondly, cell phones can be used for educational purposes. There are many apps and websites that can help with schoolwork, and having access to these resources can be very helpful for students. Additionally, students can use their phones to take pictures of notes or assignments, which can help them with their homework.

Finally, allowing students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times can give them a well-deserved break from schoolwork. They can use this time to relax, listen to music, or play games on their phones, which can help them to recharge and be more productive during class time.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better option for our school's cell phone policy. It would allow students to have access to their phones in case of emergencies, give them a well-deserved break, and provide access to educational resources.

Sincerely,
A concerned grade 6 student.",1
"The program called Seagoing Cowboys will allow you to experience adventure and vist many unique places. The reason I think this is because he gets to deal with horses every day, which I would love to do that, and when he stops he gets to travel around the cities.

Luke says he gets to care for the animals while he´s crossing oceans. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalles had to be cleand too.

He says he got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. ¨But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,¨ he says. ¨So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.¨ Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

This proves to me that the Seagoing Cowboys program trip would be fun. Please consiter this idea.             ",0
"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems is valuable. This technology would help teachers and students help understand how their classmates are feeling. The use of this technology would help with the way students learn and could help prevent serious issues with the students.

By using Facial Action Coding Systems it would help students become more engaged in class. In the article by Nick D'Alto he states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". By using this new technology it would provide an effective learning way for each individual student. The computer would be able to reconize how each student is feeling then would modify to what helps each indiviual get engaged and learn. This technology would help students get better grades and it would customize to exaclty what helps them get engaged.

This new technology would also help you reconize exactly how each person is feeling. Many people are stuggling through depression or even worse things and they are so afraid to open up. Some people just don't know how to open up to anyone and this technology would help express what each person is feeling. In this article it state, ""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conves happy, worried, etc"" (Nick D' Alto). Eventhough we might think we know how someone feels we never truly know what is going on. This technology could help bring in end to the depression that some students are going through alone.

This technology could also open up ways to reconize if people are lying. Nick D'Alto states, ""Faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". Being able to reconize how politicians or celebrities are feeling would help open up many truths to the world. For example if a student was to be lying you would be able to tell which could help out a lot in the classroom. Students might find it easy to lie which ends up getting the innocent introuble. This technology would bring an end to that.

The new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables us to identify humans emotions. This new technology would bring many different benefits to the world like helping people with their emotions, being able to reconize if people are lying, and it would help students become more engaged in their learning. Facial Action Coding System is a wonderful idea that should be brought into this world to help us get answers and help those who are going through a lot alone. ",0
"In today's world, online classes are becoming an increasingly popular way to access education. They are a valuable tool for those who cannot attend traditional schools due to personal or financial reasons. As a result, online classes are fast becoming an important option for students who want to pursue their educational goals. 

When compared to traditional school methods, online classes offer several advantages. They are more accessible since they can be used from virtually anywhere and require a much smaller investment. Students can choose how to learn at their own pace and can also have the flexibility to work around their other commitments. Moreover, online classes tend to be more engaging and interactive, as students can communicate with each other and the teacher via email, discussion forums and even video conferencing. 

On the other hand, online classes can also be challenging for some students. For example, self-discipline is a critical factor for online students and they must have a great deal of commitment and dedication in order to stay on track with their studies. Additionally, a lack of direct contact with teachers and other students can limit the learning experience and prevent students from fully absorbing the material. 

Overall, it is clear that online classes can be an effective option for students looking to further their education. They offer a number of advantages that are not available with traditional school methods, while also introducing new challenges that must be navigated. By carefully considering the pros and cons of each option, students can make an informed decision that is right for them.",1
"Hey there, Principal Smith! 👋

I'm super pumped to write this essay about how playing sports can lead to organization and increased academic performance. I know, I know, it might seem like a no-brainer, but trust me, there's actually a ton of evidence to back it up! 💡

First of all, let's talk about the organizational skills that come with playing sports. When you're on a team, you have to work together towards a common goal, which means you have to be organized and responsible. You have to show up to practices on time, follow the coach's instructions, and communicate with your teammates. It's like a big ol' team project, and it teaches you how to work together and stay organized. Plus, it helps you develop time management skills, which are super important for academic success. 📚

But that's not all! Playing sports also helps you stay focused and motivated in school. When you're on a team, you have to push yourself to be your best and work hard to improve your skills. It's like a big ol' challenge, and it teaches you how to set goals and work towards them. Plus, it's super fun and rewarding when you see yourself improve! 🏆

Now, I know some people might say that playing sports takes away from academic time, but I think that's a total myth! 🙅‍♂️ When you're on a team, you're actually more likely to stay motivated and engaged in school. You see, playing sports teaches you how to balance different responsibilities and prioritize what's important. It's like a big ol' life skill, and it helps you stay on top of your schoolwork and stay focused in class. Plus, it's super fun and rewarding when you see yourself improving! 🏆

So, there you have it! Playing sports can lead to organization and increased academic performance, and I think that's something we should totally support. 😃 I know it might seem like a small thing, but trust me, it makes a huge difference in the long run. So, let's keep the policy the way it is",1
"First of all, NASA only gets their information from research and cameras which they depend on to help them with their research too. According to the text it states,""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible. To add to that it has been twenty five years since the discovery, and there is not a for sure explanation that is logical because some people think there is smething behind it.

Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. According to the text it says,""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" Even scientists believed it too and NASA has logical thinkers in their coorporation too.

Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped.

Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about. Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life?

In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.               ",0
"Will Earth always be our home? As time goes on and we start noticing the effects human life has had on earth, we may start to consider other planets as a new home. As poeple start to brainstorm about the planets in our solar system, we have noticed Venus, our sometimes closest planet. The passage mentions many ideas on starting life there and what it would take. The author explains, in a nonbias way, why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers because he lists the dangers and risks as well as the reason why we should look into emploring the planet.

He mentions the early life of Venus and how it was similar to Earth in many ways. The author says ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""( TCOEV, 4) The author mentions the landscape structure of both planets today, metioning the similarty in rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. The author mentions the similaries with a sense of hope for humans to start looking into moving to Venus for a new home. The passage also mentions the disctance factor considering travel time, given the fact that it is near us.

Risks and challenges for this idea are also metioned by the author. The author mentions the clouds and the 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. The surface of the planet, as mentioned in the passage, has an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we have here on earth. The surface of venus has the hotest temperature compared to any other planets. These and many other conditions aren't conditions that human life can withstand.

The pros of emploring the planet are also portryed. The reader is given hope by mentioning NASA's approaching to the planet. NASA would like to allow their scientists to ""float above the fray"" thirty miles above the planets surface. It is mentioned that the conditions humans would have to go thorugh may be rough, but survivable. Though providing insight of this planet would take challenges scientists are willing to take the risk.

The author mentions the pros and cons of the reasons why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even after the many dangers metioned in a non-bias way. The author provides the reader with their own option to generate their own opinion given the facts on the dangers and the postive view on going to the planet Venus. Although moving to another planet may seen crazy to some, others think that it is something we should start to consider. Exploring unknown territory may be scary, but what do we have to gain if we do not choose to look into the many ideas of going to Venus.          ",0
"Dear principal i think you should allow us students to use our cellular devices during school as long as it's during lunch and free periods. Other wise we wouldn't have anything to do during that time. And i believe that i am not the only one who feels this way. Which i am sure you realize. My reasons for my opinion are some of these, we might have an emergency and need to call a parent to come pick us up. During our free time some of our other friends might be in different classes and we might want to talk to them which we could do by cell phones. Our parents might text us because of an emergency. You never know what could or might happen. We also could have unfinished business that we might need to take care of. And cell phones also can be helpful to text a teacher that teaches another class because you might have left something in their classroom or forgot about what you had to finish for homework. You know cell phones can be helpful in many ways that you might not fully see or understand that us teenagers do. Those are my reason why i think we should be allowed to have cell phones during lunch and free time at school. Thanks for your time and understanding , I really appreciate you reading over this letter that i have wrote to you.",0
"As a student, I believe that our principle is right to change the school's policy. If she would change the requirement to a B average it would motivate those students who really want to participate in sports or other activities to get their grade higher. This is a give and take situation and right now all the students do is take and take, but don't give it their all. You have to give your hard work to get something you want in return. You give them at least a B average and you get to take sports. Changing this policy will help out the students. They might not recognize the kindness of you changing the school policy, but for now you just have find a way to get what you need out of the students since they aren't going to do it themselves. I mean we need education way more than we need sports or other activities. What we learn here, we use in everyday life and the students are blowing their chances at a successful life. This is a good plan. I can absolutely feel it. This plan will be more successful than just giving a speech about importance and how we, the students, need to keep our grades up. It's not a active way to solve this problem. By giving a speech you're still leaving it up to the students and you can tell that leaving it up to the students doesn't give off a good result. By changing the policy you're actually doing something about it. This way it'll get through to the students much clearly than a speech that'll probably make the whole student body fall asleep. Changing the school policy will bring on motivation, change, and then a better future for us students.",0
"At the Seven Oaks School, students must choose the courses for their chosen profession at an early age. This practice has both pros and cons for both the students and their parents. 

On the plus side, this system allows the students to get more in-depth experience in the field they’ve chosen. It also allows the school to tailor its teaching efforts to the needs of the student body since it will already know the courses that need to be taught.

However, this system of course selection can be limiting for students. If their interests or ambitions change over time, they may not have the opportunity to sample courses outside of their chosen profession. Additionally, even when students want to pursue a different career, they may be forced to take courses for their chosen profession.

It is therefore important to weigh the pros and cons before implementing a system of mandatory course selection. After considering the opinion of both students and parents, it is clear that flexibility and personal choice are essential components of a successful school curriculum. Allowing students to choose their courses late in their high school career gives them an opportunity to delve into different fields and discover their true passions.",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Some people don't understand why it isn't okay to litter. I think i would be a great idea to litter. I think this because students can learn not to litter and help out are environment too. this is good for everybody it shows we have the entiative to help out making earth a cleaner safer place for everyone. But community serves id not just for cleaning up the earth its for also helping people who need us. For example like an elderly home or reading to the blind. There's just so many ways we can help people we just need a little push.

Kids are age don't care if they litter or not but i bet they would if they new how it affected are environment. Litter can hurt living things because they think its okay for them to use but its not some animals try to eat that stuff or build a nest out of it. This could be dangerous for them. Also most of the trash ends up it streams, lakes, or ponds. Soon there's no water left for the animals or the plants and they so start to die.

When we help someone out it might make us feel better and more alert of out surroundings. And plus your making someone's day. When we help out other people it shows that we have good leadership skills. When you take time out of your day to help someone or something your making an effort to help make somebody a little bit stronger.

Our school should promote community serves to promote that we actually care. And to show that if we can to do it you can do it too.",0

"Growing up, in elementary school, I never knew an enemy. Every single person I met instantly became my friend, whether they wanted to, or not. I craved attention and relished being surrounded by friends and family as often as they could tolerate me. School just happened to be my favorite place in the world because of this reason. I had a reputation of being the ""teacher's pet"", and my faithful friend group stuck by my side through thick and thin. I remember hearing about distance learning and despising the idea-- wondering who would ever willingly put themselves in a position to lose daily social interactions.

As I have matured, and become much more introverted, the prospect of attending classes at home sounds like something that I would enjoy. That being said, information motivates me, and while I have a sticky relationship with procrastination every now and then, I pride myself on my punctuality. The daunting responsibility of having to do everything by oneself is enough to repel a large majority of students. The ones who rely on teachers for everything, and who fear the persuasive powers of their own brains that convince them they could not handle it. However, there are aspects of these classes that appeal to a vast majority of students. The notion of distance learning, or online school, presents many favorable conditions for the self-motivated learner.

When I was younger, adults would rave about how mature I acted for my age. If my parents were busy with other adults, I had no trouble occupying myself, for I was always reading or completing my homework. I took a book with me any time we left the house, and it wasn't unusual for me to read the entire book in one sitting. Students with this type of self-control and motivation flourish while practicing distance learning. Depending on the age of the child in online school, this exposure to necessary responsibilities will help them establish a strong sense of motivation for personal projects later in life.

Additionally, distance learning allows the student to work at a somewhat individualized pace, disregarding assessments and strict due dates. This freedom promotes lower stress levels, because students are able to spend more or less time reviewing confusing topics, based on their needs. Not to mention, online school presents a myriad of personal research opportunities, so students are learning more about what they actually find interesting instead of information straight out of textbooks and lectures. By promoting the pursuit of education at one's own discretion, online school presents a greater number of opportunities to further develop information on a topic that would not otherwise be held within the teacher's curriculum.

Now, I will admit, I have not had the best relationship with online classes over the years. In my life, I have taken two online courses and not performed up to my full potential in either of them. While in the past, I have blamed it on my dislike for the course, I must also take responsibility for my lack of use of the resources that I had provided to me. If I had put in a small amount of extra effort, I believe that I would have performed more admirably. For online classes, you get out of them what you put into them. This is true for standard classes as well, but when there is no physical teacher, the challenge of learning is heightened.

Personally, I believe online school has great potential to grow as a normalized form of education. The possibilities are endless and the bank of knowledge is wide open. Allowing students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferences is a system tailored to fit the ideal student-- one who is self-motivated and an independent thinker, but surely not limited to such. In the near future, I hope to see this concept grow into a universal option. I believe it will lead to the betterment of our society as more young adults are training their minds to think and act independently.            ",0
"I personally disagree using cell phones in classroom, because students will not get the education they need. Students can go on other pages without teachers knowing like looking up something that they are not suppose to. It also can distract others focusing on their work, or studying for a test. It may cause an issue for teachers for allowing students using their cell phones in the classroom. Students using their cell phones can lose focus on the work that is given.

Cell phones can cause problems in the classrooms; while students are doing their own work and can not use a cellular device, while taking a test. Using any cellular device while doing any work or taking a test can get into problems by the teacher and it counts as cheating. Students can also lose their cell phones during class or losing it while going to the restroom. Students can get in trouble by other teachers using it in their classroom, can get in trouble for using it while walking, or hitting someone by accident or making someone fall. Students do not see where they are going to doing around them.

Using cellular devices will not help students learn the materials that is given. Students can get distracted on the work that is given to them and not attend to do it. Students need the education that the teachers has provided for them. So, students need to stay focus on the work and stay on task on the class work, students can genially have their cellular device off ,so is does not keep them from learning. Using cellular device can effects students thinking on a subject in class.

Teachers may not know what students are doing, on their cellular device in the classroom. It can cause problems for students if they are not using their cellular device properly in class. Teachers do not know if students are saying inappropriate comments to others students. Students can also send inappropriate images among other students.

Although, using the cellular device is not the best device for doing work or studying on a subject, that they have to do. Provided the knowledge that is given to students and stay on task when is need that way, it helps you not to get lost, but it also can provide students to learn and not to use their phones. More students lose track on time and whats around them. Using cellular devices can stop you from not doing the job quicker. It can slow the work and lesson that is given to them.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator,

Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our priviledge to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President and, although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurance of a run-off election, run-off elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods.

Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government. According to Source 2, ""state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?

Unquestionably, the Electoral College is not a sound system for presidential election in the United States. In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is obsurd to remove Americans' right to vote. Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a run-off election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overly-cautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved.

You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. Thank you.

Sincerely,

"Developing good habits and having a positive work ethic can lead to unparalleled success. The adage “no pain, no gain” rings true here, as hard work and dedication tend to be the ideal ingredients for setting oneself apart from the competition. While it is tempting to indulge in inactivity and be content with minimal effort, it is important to recognize that a lack of productivity is a danger to personal fulfillment and advancement.

"25 years ago, around Mars, a spacecraft from NASA was circling the planet.

It was taking pictures, until something strange happened. An enormous head appeared and seemed to be staring back at the camera.

A few scientists believed the Face, was made by an ""alien."" NASA has been discussing of what have may cause to make a face on Mars. We had millions of answers but didn't know which one was right.

Aliens did it. They are the ones who created the face! ""Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact."" First of all, no one knows for sure what have may of caused it. It could've been the atmosphere, or it could've been an ""alien."" Scientists thought it was probably a ""Martian mesa"", only this one almost looked like an ""Egyptian Pharoh."" You see, the shadow gave an ""illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.""

It was a good way to attract the public to the attention of Mars. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

Thousand of people wondered and were curious about the Face on Mars. ""On April 8, 2001 , Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" Close enough, they could predict what the image appeared. ""So, if there were objects in this picyure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The pictured showed landforms most common , and you could relate to Earth. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" said Garvin.

In conclusion, from 1976 to 2001, no one knows exactly what does the Face mean. The sensation was short.

NASA says it could've been a ""huge rock formation..."" It became a popular icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazine, radio talk shows."" Some people think the Fcae is ""bona fide"" evidence life on Mars. BUt what do you think? Do you think it was made by an alien?

Do you believe that aliens do exisit? Well, were not sure . You see it coul be anything.    ",0
"As I strive to be successful in my career, one of my goals is to achieve and maintain a high paying job. Having a high paying job can lead to many rewards, such as having the ability to travel and buy something without worrying about using family money. It can also give people the opportunity to try out new cuisines with expensive food items. 

Having a high paying job serves as a gateway to a world of options for travel, both near and far. It allows people to see new countries or cities, explore different cultures, or even just have a much needed relaxing vacation. Having a high paying job means that the only limitations to travel are the ones you set, for you can afford to try more experiences that enrich your life.

Moreover, having a high paying job allows people to buy what they need or want without worrying about the cost or if it will take away from a family member's money. With a secure job with a steady income, people can buy the things they need and even splurge on items. It also gives people the freedom to make purchases without feeling guilty about how it affects their loved ones.

In conclusion, having a high paying job is worth the effort and it offers many benefits, such as enabling people to travel and buy without using family money. It is a great way to experience the world’s cultures and make a secure living for oneself.",1

Dear principal,

I see that you want to reconsider two possible polices about the cell phone.

The policy that I think is better is actually both i think that students should be able to use cell phones during free time. Not during class time also i understand that many students like to use their phones a lot which you should may consider to let them use their during at least lunch or free time but not during classroom time which is very important for the students education. To learn for example when your done with a test and you have free time to text ,call ,and etc. While other students may lose concentration during their test so its better to use their cell phones during at least lunch or other free times but not in class or other important event that is happening during school time cause that is really disrespectful. Also it would be unfair that students aren't allow to have a phone. For example if their is an emergency and no one has a phone and it will cause a problem to the school .Which I consider at least a little of both policies. So you want to consider at least policy 1 and a little of policy 2 of which I want to consider you a policy3 and in this policy you may to use your phone during lunch or any free time but can't be use during class time or any important events happening during school unless its and emergency of some kind. And students would be able to have their phones cause you never know something bad would happen.

"In today's world, technology has become an essential part of our lives. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, spend time with our families, and perform our job responsibilities. In this essay, I will explore how technology can positively impact these aspects of our lives.

Communication has been greatly improved by technology. With the advent of smartphones, social media, and messaging apps, we can now communicate with anyone, anywhere, at any time. This has made it easier for people to stay in touch with their loved ones, regardless of the distance between them. For example, a grandparent living in a different country can now easily video call their grandchildren and keep up with their lives. This technology has also made it easier for people to connect with others who share similar interests or work in the same field. This has led to the formation of online communities and networks that can facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Technology has also had a positive impact on family time. With the ability to work from home, parents can now spend more time with their children and be more involved in their lives. This has led to stronger family bonds and a better quality of life for both parents and children. Additionally, technology has made it easier for families to plan and organize activities together. For example, a family can use a shared calendar app to coordinate schedules and plan outings. This has made it easier for families to spend quality time together and create lasting memories.

Finally, technology has had a positive impact on job responsibilities. With the ability to work from home, employees can now have more flexibility in their schedules and can work more efficiently. This has led to increased productivity and job satisfaction. Additionally, technology has made it easier for employees to collaborate with their colleagues and work on projects together, regardless of the location. This has led to more efficient and effective communication and has made it easier for employees to work together as a team.

In conclusion, technology has had a positive impact on communication, family time, and job responsibilities. It has made it easier for people to stay connected, spend quality time with their loved ones, and work more efficiently. While there are certainly drawbacks to technology, the benefits it provides cannot be ignored. As technology continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly continue to have a positive impact on our lives.",1
"Dear State Senator,

I think our country should choose the president by popular vote. So the people get the president they think is the best for the job. But to do this we will need people motivated to go and vote. Because not many people normally go and vote during the election. or any election for that matter.

It will help with the problem of canidates going to a certain state to get the votes. But they can just go to densly populated areas. The flip to that though is they will need to spend more time convincing and/or explaining what they will do in office. Even if we need to find a way to break a tie if a tie happens with popular vote.

The only way to fix the Electoral College vote is not all of one states vote goes to a canidate that way they can't abuse the strategy of going to the states with more votes.

"My position on the driverless car is i think it is very interrestiing on how it works but it wouldnt be something i would want to have or ""drive"". My reason being is that like it said in the pasage is that they aret completly driverless you still have to be alert so when you have to take over for the car you can which i think would be pointless because if the car was 100 percent driverless on a long trip you could take a nap or text people or get on social media but with these cars like the passage says is that if there is construction then the person has to take over so its bascilly like driving you just dont have to control the car all the time but another down fall is that you have to keep your hands on the sterring wheel all the time because in the passage it said the steering wheel had sensors in it to make sure the driver was alert in case of a problem.

Another thing is the fact that if you were to get in a accident in the car would it be your fault or the car companys and how would insurance take care of that if one person was in a driverless car and the other was not or if both were in a driverless car who would be a fault and have to pay, how would insurance work because insurance is based on the human driving past and experience but if the car was driving how would the insurance be based.

"Title: The Advantages and Disadvantages of Attending School vs. Online Classes

As an 8th grader, I have been pondering the differences between attending school and taking online classes or video conferences. After conducting research and weighing the pros and cons, I have come to realize that there are distinct advantages and disadvantages to each approach. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the two educational methods, highlighting why attending school may be more efficient than taking online classes or video conferences.

Benefits of Attending School:

1. Social Interaction: School provides a platform for students to interact with their peers, teachers, and other members of the school community. This social interaction is crucial for building relationships, developing communication skills, and enhancing overall well-being.
2. Personalized Learning: Teachers in a traditional classroom setting can provide personalized attention to students, tailoring their teaching methods to meet the individual needs of each student. This personalized approach can lead to better academic performance and a more enjoyable learning experience.
3. Hands-on Learning: Schools provide a hands-on learning environment where students can engage in experiments, projects, and other interactive activities that enhance their understanding of the subject matter.

Benefits of Online Classes or Video Conferences:

1. Flexibility: Online classes or video conferences offer the flexibility of attending classes from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly useful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where access to traditional schools is limited.
2. Cost-Effective: Online classes or video conferences can be more cost-effective than attending traditional school, as there are no commuting costs, and sometimes, no tuition fees.
3. Personalized Pace: Online classes or video conferences allow students to learn at their own pace, which can be particularly beneficial for students who need extra time to grasp a concept or who are advanced and need more challenging material.

Comparison and Contrast:

While both approaches have their advantages, attending school provides a more comprehensive learning experience. In a traditional classroom setting, students can interact with their peers, engage in hands-on activities, and receive personalized attention from",1
"Limiting on car usage has its advantages. Here are three reasons why i say limiting car usage has its advantages. Limiting on car usage has its advantages because you spend less money, less traffic and less car accidents. Dont you think that limiting on car has its advantages to?

To begin, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because you spend less money. When you spend twenty dollars a week or more on gas money for your car thats wasting money when you could just buy a bus pass for ten dollars and that will take u where u need to go for a week or more. Right there you just save ten dollars. what would you rather do spend twenty dollar a week on gas to get where you need to go or spend ten dollars a week on a bus pass which would also get u to where you need to go? Also you spend less money by limiting usage of cars by saving money on tickets. Now a days police pull you over any little thing wrong with your car and your tickets are just going to keep pileing up then if you dont pay them or send them to court you licenses will be suspended. When you just could avoid all of that.

Middle, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because less traffic. I know that in the passage, ""Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it said,""BOGOTA, colombia- In a program that's set to spread to other countires, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" but if more people are walking instead of taking cars there would be less traffic.

End, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because less car accidents. the more cars on the road the higher chance to get into a car accident. I know that you still could get in a car accident with a pedestrians but mostly car on car accidents happen. the less cars on the road the less accidents.

Conclusion, Limiting on car usage has its advantages. my three reasons were you spend less money, less traffic and less car accidents. That was how i explain why limiting on car usage has is advantages.    ",0
"We should keep the Electoral College for the voting of the United States. One good reason is they know for sure who is going to the president of the United States because of the way the Electoral College is. This voting process helps avoid a lot of bad things too. There are so many good reasons why we should keep this form of voting.

Avoiding Run-Off Elections is one good reason why we should keep the Electoral College according to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" It states that, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes."" This is good because they keep one of the presidents that got the majority of the votes to win automatically,instead they have to do some math to see who the winner is."" In the first writing ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register. This writing says that ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This is basically saying that everyone gets to go the presidential election.

Some more key points are some more notes in the first and last writing. In the writing ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" and it states, ""The Electotoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" This is saying that go by a different rule of voting because of the population being than other states. Another good point is in the first paragraph again and it says ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."" This is good that you have a schedual for for the next voting this gives us enough time to vote, it also gives the time to see if the president is good or not.

There is some downsides to this little thing you have going on here though. That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them.

To wrap things up I am telling you that your Electoral College system is great in most ways. You should try and change some of those things that are bad about it though. Not just the one I talked about but more that others talk about and doing this can you and all that work with ten times better than you were before.

Thank you for your time to read this,

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should go with 'Policy 1' because I think that you should allow students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times, but not in class. What if someone's parents couldn't get a hold of the school and it was a family emergency. Then they could text or call their child or children what has happened. Just as long as they didn't do it during a class period.

Using the first policy might let students have the freedom to get in touch with friends they don't see very often. It is also a good idea because then students will not get distracted in class. They will focus on their work instead of worrying about their phone or texting somebody in a different class. You would just have to monitor the students carefully during class so you were sure they were not using their phones.

I also think that you might want to go with 'Policy 2' because some students would still use their phone is class. They might use their phones to cheat during a test. f you used the second policy, then you probably wouldn't have to worry at all, unless people were still using their phones. Like I said before, you would still need to monitor students either way. Though, if people went into the bathroom to text, then I don't know what you should do then. Have people stay by the bathroom and make sure people don't take their phones in their with them? I have no clue what you should do for that.",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that completing high school earlier than the traditional age of 18 or 19 has numerous benefits. Not only does it provide opportunities for longer professional fields, but it also offers personal benefits such as being young and able to do more. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of completing high school early and why it is important for students to consider this option.

First and foremost, completing high school earlier can open up more professional opportunities. Many employers require a certain level of education before hiring, and completing high school early can help students meet these requirements. Additionally, some colleges and universities may offer early admission to students who have completed high school early, which can be a valuable asset when it comes to securing a spot in a competitive program.

Furthermore, completing high school early can also provide students with more time to pursue their interests and passions. High school can be a time of self-discovery and exploration, and by completing it early, students can have more time to pursue their hobbies and interests outside of the classroom. This can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life, as students are able to pursue their passions and interests without feeling like they have to rush to meet the expectations of others.

In addition to the professional and personal benefits, completing high school early can also provide students with a sense of accomplishment and pride. Graduating high school early can be a significant achievement, and it can give students a sense of pride and accomplishment that they can carry with them throughout their lives. This can be especially important for students who may struggle with confidence or self-esteem issues, as completing high school early can provide a boost of confidence and self-esteem.

In conclusion, completing high school earlier than the traditional age of 18 or 19 has numerous benefits. It can open up more professional opportunities, provide students with more time to pursue their interests, and provide a sense of accomplishment and pride. As an eighth-grade student, I encourage all my peers to consider completing high school early and take advantage of all the benefits it has to offer.",1
"Seeking multiple choice help me see if it's a good choice or not that I pick what i pick. So say if I went to the store with my mom, dad, and sister and I seen a orange but then I seen a apple. So what I would do is ask my mom which one should I get and then ask my dad finally i would ask my sister and if two of them say i should get the oranges and one of them say apples then i'm going to get the apple. I like asking people what items I should get because it help me make up my mind.

Sometimes If i ask people something it's really hard for me to make up my mind what i should pick. Usually i just close my eyes and spin around and which ever one I'm pointing at is the one i'm getting. But that was when i was a young kid now i just ask my family which one i should get it usually helps me a lot. But you can't just walk up to someone and be like which one should I get i mean some people are okay to say that to but I wouldn't do it because it is dergurous. If i was you Just stick with asking the people that you know like family or friends.

Another example say if i wanted to go hunting with my dad because he loves to hunt but i want to go fish with my grandpa because he loves fishing. So first i would have to go ask my mom and see what she say most likely she going to say my dad so then i ask my sister what should i do and she loves both of them but she would say ""my grandpa because he older man and i always go hunting"". so know to make it far i would probably go on social media and ask my friends and if most of them agree that i should go with my grandpa i take the one vote and add that to my other friends. Then if they say my dad i do the same thing I did with my grandpa add up all the vote from my friends and then add one on to it from my mom. and then i got my answer if i should go with my dad or grandpa.

If you have one choice it not as good as two choices. You maybe don't like that one choice and it would never hurt to ask more then one person. Also some people might give a good reason why you should do what you are doing and if you have go reason for both you just can't go with one you have to go with multiple choice. It's always good to go with more then one answer because you never know how much fun you have if you don't .You never know go big or go home.

When asking for advice it's can be hard at times that why you ask for many answer as you can get. Talking to people can be fun to you never know until you try it. I'm pretty sure it help a lot of people make choice on what they have to do. For example my grandma had cancer she had a choice of living and having to get surgery and have a hard time or we had a choice just letting her past away we didn't want her to have hard times so we made a vote Then we knew it was going to be hard but it was okay so we let her go. seeking multiple choices help in life it help with anything and everything. ",0
"Today, around the world, there are concerns that many individuals abuse the use of cell phones while driving a vehicle. Using a cell phone, while driving a vehicle, is dangerous to the user and puts others at risk of unnecessary accidents or death. The use of a cellular device, while driving, increases the risk of a car accident and decreases the driver's focus on the road. The abuse of cell phone usage, while driving in horrible weather conditions may also increase the risk of injury or death. Drivers should not use mobile phones while driving because it could lead to distraction which increases cognitive delays in the brain. Several emerging concerns of cell phone abuse, while driving, includes: texting or speaking to another individual, an increase in vehicular accidents, and a disruption of brain activity which results in a decrease of concentration.

Texting or speaking on a mobile phone while driving is distracting to a driver of a vehicle. These types of distractions may cause drivers to lose focus of the road or their surroundings which can ultimately endanger the driver and others. Talking to people, while operating a vehicle increases one's distraction. Conversations, by mobile phone, while driving, can be emotionally charged which only decreases awareness on the road, its rules and other drivers on the road. Cell phone distraction rates, due to texting or speaking while driving, are at an all-time high. Taking one's eye off the road or removing a hand off the steering wheel significantly increases the chance of an unnecessary car accident. It is not only the responsibility of the driver with a cell phone, but the individual on the other end of the conversation, to be respectful of the need for a driver to have complete focus while driving. At one time, cell phones did not exist, so it is imperative that conversations between people are held before or after a person is no longer operating a vehicle. There are state laws which have recently passed that impose fines, upon individuals, for cell phone abuse, such as texting while driving.

Accidents can be caused by individuals using their cellphones while driving. Car accidents and human deaths, due to cell phone abuse while driving, have unfortunately increased in the United States. Today, nearly everyone uses a cell phone where people check their social media, read or send text messages and/or make calls. Unfortunately, many people try to use their phones while driving which cause car accidents. Car accidents can ultimately lead to unnecessary injury or death of innocent bystanders. In addition to driving under the influence, the use of cell phones while driving increases accidents the world over.

A disruption within the human brain causes an individual to lose concentration or focus while driving. For example, driving a vehicle and talking to someone on the phone cannot be given the same amount of equal attention at the same time. For example, if the brain, of a driver, is focusing on a conversation on the phone, he or she may not notice the red light because he or she is looking at the phone versus straight ahead. It is virtually impossible for an individual mentally focus one hundred percent on more than one thing at a time. People cannot multitask where there is optimal focus and effectiveness. The brain handles tasks sequentially, switching from one task to another. Yet, the brain is incapable of juggling focus or attention simultaneously. .

The abuse of cell phones, while driving, is detrimental to oneself and others due to the contributing factors of texting, holding phone conversations, vehicular accidents and loss of focus due to limits within the human brain. There is only about a three second reaction time between a potential car crash and a driver being distracted by his or her cell phone. Texting or holding a conversation on a mobile device, while driving, is arguably just as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol or other substances. In many states, throughout North America, it has been made illegal to write, send, or read a text-based communication while operating a vehicle. Today, current vehicles install bluetooth in order to increase the use of hands free cell phone use, and in hopes of decreasing unnecessary vehicular accidents.   ",0

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College for the Presidential Election

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method of selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it a crucial component of our democratic system. In considering this issue, I have carefully reviewed several sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Unlike a popular vote system, where a dispute over the result can easily arise, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote. The winner-take-all basis in most states also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral vote victory. Therefore, the Electoral College system minimizes the likelihood of post-election disputes.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the president is ""everyone's president."" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a scenario where a candidate with only regional support becomes the president and neglects the interests of other regions. By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters, the Electoral College promotes a more inclusive and representative presidency.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in the Electoral College system motivates candidates to campaign in swing states. As seen in the 2012 election, candidates focused their efforts on toss-up states, where the election outcome is uncertain. This increases voter engagement and encourages thoughtful voting, as voters in swing states become crucial in deciding the election. By prioritizing the concerns and interests of states that are not firmly aligned with either party, the Electoral College forces candidates to address a wider range of issues.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. Large states, which suffer from the mal-apportionment of the Senate, regain some weight in the political balance through the allocation of electoral votes. A victory by a slight margin in a large state, such as Florida, yields a significant number of electoral votes, while a similar victory in a small state, like Wyoming, results in fewer electoral votes. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on large population centers and gives smaller states a voice in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the cases of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This prevents the elections from becoming more complex and expensive with the requirement of run-off elections.

While I understand that opponents of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair and outdated, I believe that the advantages it offers outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College promotes stability, ensures a more inclusive presidency, encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College for the presidential election. It is integral to our democratic system and provides a fair and effective means of selecting the President of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope that you will consider my perspective in your decision-making process.

Yours sincerely,

"Extracurricular activities are somewhat controversial.

Some people think that they are great and others think they overwork kids and take up to much time.

I personally think they are wonderful because they create friendships, strengthen team building skills, and create more job and college opportunities for kids.

So, if my principle required all kids to participate in at least one extracurricular, I would not object and here's why.

First off, not all kids fit in at school.

Some don't even have friends to talk to.

If they participated in an after school activity they would make more friends and it would help them out.

When someone is in an extracurricular activity they work with people who have similar interests.

Therefore, someone in that activity could form relationships with people.

This would help kids form more friendships and make their remaining years at school much more enjoyable.

So, one big impact extracurricular activities have, is giving kids more opportunities to make friends.

Another impact extracurricular activities have is strengthening team building skills and helping kids work well with others.

In most after school activities all of the kids are working towards a common goal.

Whether it be winning a game, publishing a school newspaper, or creating a masterpiece it's always a similar goal.

All the kids work together to accomplish it.

This helps them develop team building skills and allows them to learn about working with all kinds of different people.

For example, if a football team wanted to win their next big game, everyone on the team would have to put in effort and help each other out.

They wouldn't be able to win the game if the defense wasn't protecting the quarterback or if the quarterback wasnt throwing the ball.

So, it teaches kids that they need to help each other out and work together to accomplish things.

Lastly, it should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity because it creates more job and college opportunities for kids.

When colleges are looking at students, they want a kid who can offer more than just a good grade point average.

They want a kid who can work hard and make a difference.

So, they look to see if a kid has participated in an extracurricular.

If the kid has one on their record it will increase their chances of getting excepted.

Jobs look for the same qualities colleges do because it they want a good dependable employee.

Participating in an extracurricular activity increases someones chances of getting accepted at a college or job, so it is in their best interest to join one.

Overall, extracurricular activities help with a lot of things, some of the main ones are creating friendships, building team skills, and creating more job and college opportunities for kids.

There are many more reasons why participating in extracurricular activities are beneficial, but if I named them all it would take hours!

These activities are a good thing for kids, and kids should be required to participate in one every year.

The benefits that come from after school activities are great and very helpful to a lot of kids.          ",0

"Dear principal,

I am writing u this letter to tell u why i think that u should let students with a B grade average play sports or any other activities they wish to be in. Because even though they might be struggling in school or on that one subject they just cant get right dose not mean that they cant be in any extra activities that they wish. And if they are struggling then they should try and get help or if they are already in a sport or activities, they u shouldn't kick them off the team or out of that class because the work is too hard and they don't under stand how to do it. You should just try and get them help so they can stay in the activities they are in. But if they need help and they are not saying anything or don't seemed concerned about there graded then you can let them be on there own and not help them if they don't want help or if they think they are too good to be help or they are just like ""oh well its just on grade it wont take any affect to my grade average."" And then it does then they are trying to get some extra credit to make up for that work. When they thought they were too good for anything. And they should be kicked out of those activities if they do there work but have bad behavior . And that's what i think.",0
"Have you ever someone's opinions, but didn't know who to ask? Instead of asking one person you can ask multiple people. You would be better off asking multiple people because, you can get more than one view and opinion on things, you gain more experience ,

and you can come up with new ideas.

Have you ever heard people arguing about who's right and who's wrong? Let's they are both right they just have different opinions . You take both of their opinions into account. The more opinions you have the better choices you will make. Use your reasources and make better chioces.

The more experiance you have the more you can tell people. As you get older you gain more life experiances , so you will have more opinions. People will come to you for opinions and they will keep coming back for more.

Have you ever come up with a new idea

? The more opinions you have the better ideas you come up with. The scientist Thomas Eddison didn't just com eup with the light bulb he had other opinions. There is quote that says,""the more opinions you have the better the ideas"".

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system for choosing the President of the United States. While some argue that it is outdated and unfair, I believe that the Electoral College serves an important purpose and should be maintained.

Firstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of citizens. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process by allotting electoral votes based on their representation in Congress. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, candidates would primarily focus on densely populated areas, leaving the concerns and interests of rural areas and smaller states largely ignored.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in elections. While a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes means that even a very slight majority in a state leads to a landslide victory in electoral votes. This reduces the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which could potentially result in a deadlock or the need for a run-off election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Candidates must focus on winning in multiple states and regions, rather than just targeting the most populous areas of the country. This ensures that the President has broad-based support and is accountable to a diverse range of constituents. In a popular vote system, candidates could effectively ignore large portions of the country and cater only to the interests of certain regions.

The Electoral College also gives weight to the political balance of large states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may seem unfair, the Electoral College offsets this by giving more attention and influence to larger states in presidential campaigns. This helps to prevent candidates from solely focusing on small, swing states and ensures that the concerns of both smaller and larger states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the complexity and potential for prolonged election processes, allowing for a clear winner to be determined.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College system, such as its potential to disenfranchise voters in non-competitive states, it is important to consider the benefits and practical reasons for retaining it. The Electoral College ensures that each state has a voice in the election process, promotes regional appeal in candidates, encourages campaigns to focus on a diverse range of states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College system should be kept in place for electing the President of the United States. It provides a fair and balanced approach to representation and ensures that the interests of all states and regions are taken into account. While improvements can be made to the system, a complete abandonment of the Electoral College would not be in the best interest of our country.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1
"There are many things that the world can benefit from by having driverless and smart cars. Deaths caused by car accidents, reckless, and drunk drivers would not be as high as they are now if we had driverless and smart cars. The amount of gas usage would not be as high as it is, becuase most people would not even need it. People would not have the stress of worrying about crashing into others cars or things. A car being a smart car, knowing when things are getting dangerous, and knowing not to crash into things would be also very beneficial for beginners and drivers who are paranoid about driving. Driverless and smart cars could really change the way the world works when it comes to cars.

I think driverless cars would be safer for the world. When people die by car it is usually because of the reckless and drunk drivers behind the wheel. Now sometimes you can not control the way a person drives and also acccidents happen. With smart and driverless cars you have less things to worry about when it comes to things like accidents. I feel as if driverless cars would really help contribute to the stopping of all the unnecessary deaths cause by reckless and drunk drivers.

In 2013 BMW developed a car that was called a

"" Traffic Jam Assistant "". That car could handle functions at speeds up to 25 mph. It could accelerate, steer, and brake for itself. Even though the car did all of those things, it still notified the person behing the wheel when they needed to pay attention to the road ahead. I feel as if a car that is able to do that is wonderful and very beneficial to drivers and pedestrians. Being that people have already started developing these types of cars, I think that they should go on with making them better and safer for the world to have.

Driverless and smart cars are things that just shows how well we have advanced with technology. Driverless and smart cars should continue to be developed and made even better in differnt ways. Why not take advantage of new techonology, and use it in a good way. Driverless and smart cars are bound to be great in years to come.",0
"Phones & Driving

Today people are so easily distracted, so many people get in wrecks because of it. Thousands of people are killed or injured in accidents because someone had to send one more text or take one more picture. Imagine if a loved one left there house to visit for supper, and the never arrived. You would be terrified, then you get a call to be told that they have been in an accident. Of course it was by a young man distracted by his cell phone. People should not be allowed to be on there at all, not for any reason.

There are three types of distractions manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when your hands are off the wheel and not being used to drive safely, visual distraction is when your eyes are not on the road and are instead on your cell phone, last a cognitive distraction refers to taking your mind of driving and being more focused on your cell phone. Using a cell phone while driving uses all three types, which highly increases the chances of getting into an accident. ""People are as impaired when they drive and talk on the cell phone as they are when they are intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08%."" (""Distracted Driving Facts"")

If people are as distracted as a driver that is intoxicated while using a cell phone while driving is just as if not more dangerous on the road. Also, there are most likely more people on their cell phone while driving than people under the influence of alcohol on the road.

Not only are there problems with endangering other and yourself, there are also economic problems. ""Economic losses from distracted driving could total $46 billion a year."" (""Background on: Distracted driving"").

""NHTSA released a study in May 2014 which focused on behavioral factors that contributed to 32,999 highway fatalities and 3.9 million injuries in the U.S. in 2010 the study found that those crashes cost $277 billion in economic losses and $594 billion in societal harm, for a total of $871 billion that year""

('Background on: Distracting driving""). Therefore, we are also losing billions of dollars a year due to distracting driving, Which could lead to are government increasing taxes to get that money back. Not only will it put our country in debt but maybe even people living here.

Finally, the laws for driving and being on your cell phone should be a lot more strick, and enforced stronger. We cannot have innocent people getting injured or killed every year because people are being distracted by their cell phones. Also, we can't let our country get in debt because of this either, no one wants taxes to be raised just to pay back all that money, instead let it be used for schools or other educational purposes. Last, Lets all put are put are phones away and keep the roads safe for the people of the future.

"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about first impressions and how they can affect our relationships with others. I mean, let's be real, first impressions are like, super important, right? They can make or break how people perceive us and how we perceive them.

Like, I remember this one time when I first met my BFF in middle school. I was like super nervous and didn't know what to say, so I just stood there awkwardly and fidgeted with my hair. And honestly, it took me like, forever to make a good impression on her. But once I finally opened up and started talking about my favorite things, like, she was totally cool and we've been besties ever since.

But on the other hand, I've also had some not-so-great first impressions. Like, there was this one kid in my class who was like, super arrogant and always bragging about how he was better than everyone else. And honestly, it was like, total turn-off. I didn't want to be around him or talk to him, and I definitely didn't want to be his friend.

So, from my experiences, I think it's safe to say that first impressions are like, super important. They can set the tone for how people perceive you and how you perceive them, and they can either make or break your relationships. And I think it's important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others, because like, you never know when you're going to meet someone who could be a really important person in your life.

But at the same time, I also think it's important to give people a chance and not judge them too quickly. Like, I've had friends who I didn't really click with at first, but once we got to know each other better, we became super close. So, I think it's important to keep an open mind and not write someone off just based on one impression.

Overall, I think first impressions are like, super important, but they're also not the only thing that matters. It's important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others, but also to give people a chance and not judge them too quickly",1
"The act of kindness is a small gesture that can have a big impact on someone's life. It can be as simple as holding the door for someone, lending a book, or offering a helping hand. Kindness is a powerful force that can bring people together and make the world a better place.

When someone receives kindness, it can make them feel valued and appreciated. It can also give them a sense of hope and optimism. For example, if someone is going through a tough time, a small act of kindness like a hug or a compliment can make them feel less alone and more supported. This can have a ripple effect on their life, as they may start to feel more confident and better equipped to handle challenges.

Kindness can also have a positive impact on the person who performs the act. When someone does something kind for someone else, it can give them a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It can also make them feel more connected to others and to the world around them. This can lead to a greater sense of happiness and well-being.

Additionally, kindness can have a positive impact on society as a whole. When people are kind to each other, it can create a sense of community and belonging. It can also help to reduce conflict and promote understanding and empathy. This can lead to a more peaceful and harmonious society.

In conclusion, the act of kindness is a powerful force that can have a big impact on someone's life. It can make them feel valued and appreciated, give them a sense of hope and optimism, and make them feel more connected to others and to the world around them. It can also have a positive impact on society as a whole, by creating a sense of community and promoting understanding and empathy. It's important for everyone to practice kindness, no matter how small or big the gesture may be.",1
"Principal,

Hello, I have notice you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service. Some might agree with you because our community needs to be taking care of. On the other hand, others might degree because they believe community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. I would like to tell you why i believe that you should be required to perform community service.

Some agree that the community service is needed because we need to take care of our community.

It is very important to take care of the community. If we don't then our community would have litter all over the ground, elementary children need help and if we are not willing to help them then not good grades would be on their report cards. We don't have a lot of people helping in our community services so we need more helpers but the people we do have doesn't regret helping out and serving their job.

Other students however, believes that community service takes too much time away from things they want and need to do. Now a lot of students play sports and homework and etc. but maybe on days that they don't have anything to do or they have extra time they can service the community. Only if it is only an hour at the soup kitchen, I'm sure they wouldn't mind helping out even if it isn't a lot of time.

I believe that students should be required to perform community service because we need to clean up on community and help out. It doesn't matter if it is just an hour or if it is five hours, students need to learn to help out with the surroundings around us. I strongly believe that students need to be required because they will see the fun and great feeling of taking care of the community.

Thank you for taking your time and reading this letter. I hope you understand my thoughts about your decision.

Take care, fellow students.",0
"I think that if a child don't wanna do at least one extracurricular activity the child don't have to because of work,family,money, and maybe the child is just tried and wanna chill after school.

Family can take up a lot of time. If you have a brother's or sister's maybe even someone in your family is sick and you have to take care of them. Sometimes your mom and dad have to work. On top of going to school and making sure your grades are good so you'll be able to stay in your extracurricular activity. That takes a lot of time and after a while you'll get tried and that's not healthy.

Money can be a big reason why you can't do one. Most extracurricular activity cost a lot of money mostly sports. It can even be getting to where your suppose to go because some people don't have cars. Some people have to go to work depending on if what grade there in and there mom or dad have the money or not. extracurricular cost a lot of money that people don't have.

Sometimes work can get in the way of extracurricular activity. If your in high school depending or your age you might have a job. Taking time or showing up late to your job will hurt your pay check might even get fried. High school is not the only one that goes threw this all grades do most of the time people moms and dads have to work. That happened's to a lot of kids and Teens.

Lastly sometimes after a long day if school you might wanna go home and chill. School is a lot to handle on the mind. To class work, grades, and people sometimes a child don't even like to talk to people but there family. After doing studying,doing homework and taking test you'll get tried and dont wanna do anything else. That's a lot of work on the mind.

Finally people have others things to do or can't do it at all because of work, money family, and just dont wanna do anything. But at the end of the day it's the persons choice if she/he wanna do it or not but I say no.        ",0
"November 1, 2015, was the day that law of no texting and driving became illegal. Texting and while driving a vehicle can be very dangerous causing an accident, injury or even death. Phones should not be allowed while the driver is driving due to those causes. Phones can be a distraction for the driver because the light of the phone it get the drivers attention to know what's going on. There is a percent of 1.6 millions of crashes due to the texting and driving issues. While you're on the road you need to stay away from your phone at all time and ignore any calls you might get.

Sending a quick little message to someone can cause your own death or accident. Phones have this thing that makes you want to get it, but while you are driving it to cause so anything. Putting your phone on do not disturb at all times while driving can be a safer way not causing something. Some ways to avoid texting and driving to also put your away somewhere you can not reach while driving. If the message or text is important then pull over somewhere and that won't cause anything. Texting and driving cannot be a safe way of your actions. If you know that texting while driving can be an unhealthy way to do it in the first place.

As a teenager what did you study in school? No texting and driving, right? And also that texting and driving is also the same thing as no drinking and driving, so why to do it now. Your whole life can be gone due to this little mistake. When you first had your permit were you scared to crash your parent's car? Well that the same thing here too but just that it's your own car and not theirs. On papers everywhere in the world it always tells you don't text and drive, so might mean to be safe on the road.

Drivers, in my opinion, should not be using phones at all times or even have a view of the phone while driving. I understand that if you don't know where a place is located, you have to use a GPS but you can put that while your parked and just need to hear where to go. If you are a parent of a teenager then I think you need a drive cam. A drive cam can avoid your teen of getting in a crash or something worse.

I think that texting and driving should be avoided in all states for everyone's safety. Texting and driving the reason of your own death and finish your life there. There's no way to come back if only you weren't texting. So are you going to text and drive again?

Do you want to keep texting and driving to take away your own life?                              ",0
"The Seagoing Cowdays program is a good program if you like spending weeks at a time on a boat. It has great views of the ocean, and if you get up early you might be able to see the sun rising up over the ocean.

It might be a little risky being on that boat in a storm. When the animals are gone and your on your way to get more there is room and time to do things like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and much more.

"Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. People ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person let me tell you why.

For example, people ask for advises all the time; because each persons has a different experience. You can ask older people or adults about thier experiences. That might help you make the right choice. In addition, you can ask your mom, dad, and grandparents and thier person you can really trust. You can ask them questions maybe that will help with what ever problem you are going through. Another thing you can do is to confess with an adult. About your problems. A person that you really trust.

On the other hand, in school you can also ask for advice. Your counselor is a person that can give you really good advises that can help you. It's a person that you can let all your feelings out. Teachers can also give you an advice or an experience they have had in life. For example, I have a teacher that I trust and when I need her she is always there for me. Your principal or administrators can give you opinions. They can also help you when you are in a bad condition. I think hearing different advises and experiences can help you a lot.

Finally, in church you can ask your pastors for advice so you can make a proud choice. Even reading the bible can help you. For example, I always put God first no matter what. I think my knowledge is more mature. When I make a decision I ask God give me the right of understanding things. I prey an ask God questions I know he hears me. He protects me from all the bad things. I know if I do something wrong God still loves me and you. He will always be there when you need him. No matter what the people say God dosen't think that of you. He knows you can do better. God loves you God bless you.

In conclusion, these are ways that can help you with life. I don't know if it helps you but helps me. And I say it one more time God loves you.",0
"I think that we students should at least keep a c grade average on the report card. So that we can attend our sports more easily and more relaxing. To much work for someone may over work there brain, and that is called stressed. Stress can bring there grades down lower than ever.

It puts loads of pain suffering and difficulties for them. all together they will be crashing down and it will be hard for them to come back for while . Parents will be shocked and heart broken to.

So keeping the grade averages should stay a c. For at least ports. This would be a problem if any student was falling because of stress and nobody wants to fail because of that. Would you? Cause to me that is horrible seeing some one fail. Its like watching your country get bombed. Its sad you don't want to watch people fail cause of a sport or grades. You want to help. You think about it and tell me what you think.",0
"Driverless cars are coming, but they may not be the future most people are hoping for. Of course people want one--it is new and cool, but it will not be what they expected. Driverless cars would extremely expensive with all of the technology they are using. Also, it could be very dangerous without an alert driver ready to step in. There are several problems with driverless cars becoming humanity's future.

One problem is money--how will people be able to afford these driverless cars? For example, Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. The combination of all of these is absolutely necessary for the driverless car to have the skill of a human at the wheel. The combination of all of these is also very costly. Only a minority of the population would be able to buy such a car, and just because they're able to, doesn't mean they will be willing to. Many people might think the car isn't worth that much money if they can drive themselves. Economic problems will always be around.

Another issue is the danger of driverless cars. Nowadays, sensors can detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers and can cause the car to apply brakes by itself. It is a brilliant plan, but what happens when it does not work? Technology cannot always be perfect; it is bound to have glitches at some point. If manufacturers do bring in in-car entertainment and information systems so that the driver will not get bored, that means that the driver will not be alert and ready. For example, if the car's automatic brake system does not work, and the driver is not paying attention, there could be a serious crash with many people getting injured. Technoloy should not be relied upon because there is not a 100 percent guarentee of it always working.

In theory, driverless cars are an excellent idea. However, when they're actually applied and put to use, it is not going to have the best results. Many people may want a driverless car, but how will they get one if they cannot afford it? Not everyone has money just lying around, ready to buy a driverless car that would cost a fortune. In addition, the risk factor is too high. So many things could go wrong which could result in people actually getting injured. Driverless cars may be what humanity wants, but it is definitely not what they need.",0
"Arts edukation is impotent for a well-rounded edukation. I think it should be mendatory. Alot of peeple say it should be optional but I disagree.

First of all, arts edukation helps us exspres ourselves. We can use art, music, and drama to show how we feel. It's like a way of communikating without using words. For exemple, when I'm feeling sad, I like to draw a picshure of a cloudy day. It helps me feal beter.

Second, arts edukation can help us in other subjcts too. For exemple, when we're lerning about fractions in math, we can use music to help us rember the numbers. It's fun and it helps us undrstand it beter.

Third, arts edukation is good for our brains. It helps us think cratively. We can come up with new ideas and solvs problems in a diffrent way. It's like a exercise for our brains.

Finally, arts edukation is impotent for our sosiety. It brings peeple togther. We can share our art, music, and drama with each other. It helps us understand diffrent cultures and tradishuns.

In konklusion, arts edukation is esential for a well-rounded edukation. It helps us exspres ourselves, helps us in other subjcts, good for our brains, and it's good for our sosiety. So I think it should be mendatory.

"Hey there!  So, I'm pretty sure we all know that playing sports is super important for our health and fitness, but did you know that not getting enough sleep or eating a healthy diet before a game can actually be really bad for us? Like, really bad. 

I mean, think about it. When we don't get enough sleep, we're all groggy and tired, and it's way harder to focus and play our best. And if we're not eating right, we might not have enough energy to even make it through the game.  It's like, how are we supposed to win if we're not even taking care of ourselves? 

But, you know, family commitments can be a real thing that gets in the way of practicing for a game. Like, my little sister is always begging me to play with her, and my mom wants me to help with dinner, and it's hard to find time to practice when there's all that going on.  It's like, I get it, family is important, but can't they just give me a break sometimes? 

And don't even get me started on students with full-time jobs and school commitments.  It's like, how are they supposed to fit in practicing for a game on top of everything else? It's just not fair. 

But, you know what? There are ways that we can manage our time and still make sure we're taking care of ourselves. Like, we can try to eat healthy snacks before the game, like fruits and veggies, instead of junk food. And we can make sure we get enough sleep by going to bed early and getting a good night's rest.  It's like, it might take a little bit of extra effort, but it's worth it in the end. 

And, you know, eating a healthy diet can do so much more than just help us play better in sports.  It can help us feel better overall, and even give us more energy to play",1
"Do you think you will make a better choice when seeking opinions from other people? I believe so. I think that asking multiple people will help you make a better choice because you can get more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea.

By asking more people, you get more opinions. If you are stuck on a decision and don't know what to do, ask people to help you make the decision. With more opinions you can look at all the different views of the decision and decide what is best. Sometimes people make decisions on just their opinion, but other times it is in your best interest to ask other people because they could have a better opinion or judgment on the topic or issue. One time I was doing my homework and I did not understand how to do it. I asked my parents for some advice on how to do my homework and with their advice, I was able to understand the homework.

Receiving feedback is important when it comes to advice and opinions. When asking lots of people for feedback, they can give you some suggestions and tips about what to improve on for whatever you are doing. It helps you build on what you already have and make it better. Once I was doing a really important project for a class and went in during resource to ask the teacher for feedback about what I could improve on in the project. I got some feedback on what to improve and did it. I got a better grade on the project after I changed it then what I would of gotten before. Feedback on something can also help for future opportunities. Those are the reasons why I think receiving feedback is important and helpful.

When doing something, having the best idea is always good, but you can't always come up with that on your own. If you have multiple people trying to come up with a solution, you can combine their ideas to come up with the best idea/opinion. There is also more creativity and brainpower put together when you have lots of people working to try and come up with the best idea. In school, one of the reasons why teachers do group projects is to try and get multiple people working together to come up with a really good idea or solution. Multiple people working together is how you get the best idea or solution for whatever it is you are doing.

I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. I think that because you can gather more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea. You should ask other people for help before you make a decision on your own.",0
"Success is a term that is used to describe a person's ability to achieve their goals and aspirations. It is a multifaceted concept that has academic, professional, and personal importance. Academically, success is measured by a person's ability to excel in their studies and achieve good grades. Professionally, success is measured by a person's ability to advance in their career and achieve financial stability. Personally, success is measured by a person's ability to live a fulfilling life and achieve their personal goals.

While success is often associated with positive outcomes, failure is also an important aspect of achieving success. Failure can be seen as a learning experience that helps individuals identify areas for improvement and develop new strategies for achieving their goals. In fact, many successful individuals have encountered failure at some point in their lives, but have used it as a stepping stone to success.

Dedication, effort, and enthusiasm are also crucial components of achieving success. Successful individuals are often those who are dedicated to their goals and put in the effort to achieve them. They are also enthusiastic about their work and are motivated to continue pursuing their dreams.

There are many examples of individuals who have achieved success despite encountering failure. One such example is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling faced numerous rejections from publishers before finally finding success with her first book. However, she continued to write and eventually published all seven books in the series, which has since become one of the most successful book franchises in history.

Another example is Thomas Edison, who is known for his many inventions. Edison faced numerous failures before finally achieving success with his invention of the phonograph. However, he continued to work on new inventions and eventually developed many other successful products, including the light bulb and the motion picture camera.

In conclusion, success is a multifaceted concept that has academic, professional, and personal importance. Failure can be seen as a learning experience that helps individuals identify areas for improvement and develop new strategies for achieving their goals. Dedication, effort, and enthusiasm are also crucial components of achieving success. There are many examples of individuals who have achieved success despite encountering failure, including J.K. Rowling and Thomas Edison.",1
"The Facial Action Coding System,can read peoples expressions.

Should this technology be used in classrooms to detect the emotins of the students?

This technology should not be used to detect the emotions of students. The article stated that this tech, could be used to detect when a student is getting tired or bored of the lesson. This would then allow the computer to liven the lesson up, as the text states directly, ""Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."" This line makes it seem like it(the FACS technology) would replace teachers in the classroom.

Teaches do not need technology to tell if their students are bored, as the text says, people just know what the emotions of others are. The teacher would know when, and how to modify the lesson to keep their students interested, and engaged. Would we know what the technology would do to modify the lesson? Would the students just be able to be angry at the lessons until the computer just stops giving the student lessons? Using this tech is not an alternative to having a real person tell how you feel. The teacher can help you feel better because they know how you really feel, because they have empathy. The computer can tell how you feel, but it does not what it is like to feel, so in the end it can't really help.

Should the FACS tech be used in the classroom? No, because the students need a teacher to help them feel better when they are frustrated or sad, not a computer that can only try and make them happy. It also seem sthat they want this tech, to replace our teachers,which would hurt the students more than it would help them.",0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to argue that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to electing the president by nationwide popular vote. While the Electoral College has its intentions of giving voice to smaller states, I believe the popular vote would better represent the will of all American citizens.

One argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign across many states. However, research shows that candidates largely focus their efforts on only a handful of swing states that could vote either way. This means that many states are ignored during campaigns. Switching to the popular vote would motivate candidates to campaign everywhere and develop policies that appeal to a wide variety of Americans from different backgrounds. 

It is also argued that the Electoral College protects the influence of smaller states. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates win the Electoral College despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the one person, one vote principle that is so important in our democracy. While smaller states may receive slightly less individual attention under a popular vote, every vote would carry equal weight. Candidates would still visit a variety of large and small states to maximize their vote totals.

A possible counterargument is that foreign powers could try to influence the national outcome through campaigns in just a few highly populated states. However, this same risk exists in our current system, as opponents might spend large sums in swing states. Additionally, switching to the popular vote may increase national voter turnout and civic participation, countering any foreign influence efforts.

In conclusion, adopting a nationwide popular vote would make every citizen's ballot equally important and better align presidential elections with our democratic values. While the Electoral College was well-intentioned, it no longer serves the needs of our large, mobile society. I urge you to support election of the president by popular vote to give voice to all Americans. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1
"people should not make their own decisions because people hurts someone feelings about the decisions they are making, people always need someone to be agree if their decisions are good to make it, and people think just because they are old enough can make better decisions.

People hurts someone feelings because they made something really bad even if a person tells them that they are doing wrong things, they keep doing it, because for them the decisions that they are making are great for them. One example, lets say, when we were young that we fall a lot time in love. we were wishing to have someone to advise us because we think if the decision that we are going to make is not going to hurt someone. We always think about what is going to happen if we do things that we know are not good choices. We need somebody to advise us about anything. Another example, when I was planing to leave my house with my boyfriend because I did not wanted to go to school. I get really mad. I did not think on anything. I just wanted to do it even if Mom gets a heart attack because she wants me be more educate and have a better future, so someone that I have not seen in my whole life get close to me and say "" You are too young, think about what life can brings you if you go to school, if you graduate from college that many wonderful thing you can have. Do not throw your life in that way. You will have time to be with someone"" I realized that I was making the worse decision ever.

Everyone always need someone to be agree about their decisions, because someone may have a lot of experience about life that way they can be the guide for them. they can talk about the decisions that they were making in the past and that can helps to make a good decisions. One example, one friend made a bad a really bad decision. His family told him to stop doing the things he was doing because it will be a lot consequences. That is what happened he made a wrong decision. He did not listen and now is dead because of his decisions.

Most think that they are old enough to take their own decisions, as we can see, it does not matter what age we have. What matters is how mature we are, because we have to be aware of the responsibility about any kind of decisions we are going to make. We have to say to ourselves "" okay if I do this I have to be conform about the result that I am going to get"".

Clearly, All we do is because someone is making us better by telling that we do not always have to trust on ourselves. Sometimes for some discussion we do not do the right thing, we do not think and we use our bad mood and due to that we make bad choices. We have to be more responsible. "" Make good choices, do not let your mood take position of your actions"".

Think before your decisions.",0
"Have you ever had a really hard decision that you can't make up your mind about? Sometimes when you're thinking, you may not know what decision is the healthiest for you to make. Having more than one opinion on a problem can lead to making a better choice making process. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a choice that impacts them in a great way.

People are very different from one another. Most of the time when there is a problem, they have different opinions and views on that certain issue. When searching for advice on decision making, you can get different choices and see what works best for you. One person may not know whats best for you, but if you have someone else that you can talk to, they might. The people you are talking to can have solutions that are not the same. You can use their advice, and choose which set you like the best.

Seeking help from more than one person can help you make the right choice. When you talk to more than one person, you may have a set of advice to lean on if the other set doesn't seem to be working. It is very similar to a plan A, plan B situation. When looking for advice from two people who are similar, you can use a little bit of each set of advice, adn use the one that will work best for you. When having multiple peoples advice combined, that can, mostly always, lead to better decision making.

When faced with a lot of stress, your decision making abilities may not be working as well as it usually does. In this case, you may not know what is best for yourself. Most of the time we don't know whats best for ourselves, but having multiple people to talk to can help us make better decisions. Other people may know what is best for you. When talking to more than one person about the problems/issues you're having, one of those people might not know much about your issues as much as the other person. Talking to multiple people may help you get more reliable information that can help you in your decision making process.

So yes, seeking information from multiple people can help improve decision making. Advice will differ from person to person, but the outcome will be better, rather than talking to just one person. Talking to more than one friend at a time is a healthy solution to help make hard decisions.",0
"In my opinion I believe that the use of this technology is great because in the text it was stated that ""a classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and since mosts students dont like to speak up maybe the teacher can ask them after class if they understood the subject or the lesson that day.

But everything has an opposing side. This could also not be a benefit because maybe if someone has a private feeling saying maybe like a crush and the computer states something like ""in love"" maybe thats something they wanted to keep for themselves. well mainly that would depend on the teacher you have or if she/he will tell anyone but id doubt it.

Some feelings are also really difficult to understand like maybe the computer can bring the wrong emotion or mis calculate how you are feeling. "" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" according to Dr. huang.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I am STUDENT_NAME, an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME. I disagree with your plan to require a 'B' average in classes to participate in sports. Many students are smart and apply themselves, but do not fully understand subject material.

Do not think that they are not trying to get a good grade; They just need more help understanding the material. I know many very smart students who have difficulty with a certain subject. they care about getting a good grade, and want to do well. Not many of the se people play sports, but this new policy you have proposed will still affect them. Many students have a 'C', and they just need to get better help for that. I believe that doing sports helps a student get better grades, as they have a drive to continue, so as not to get kicked off their team. They will also have time to exercise and stretch while playing sports, which increases cardiovascular activity. You yourself said that ""The best way to prepare is to get your blood pumping through cardiovascular activity"".

Blood flow increases cognitive activity, which will help students achieve better grades because they will understand the subject matter better. Sports allow students to take a break from school and have some time with their friends. They will want to stay with their freinds, so they have another motive to try harder and get good grades. Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"Online school? Online classes? Everything has become online this day in age. Even school has became an online thing. I believe online classes should not be allowed, unless there is a certain class that is not offered in the particular school and the student wants to take it, then that should be allowed and go towards high school credits. Or if there is a personal reason why a student can not come to school to learn. Other than that, not all students should be allowed to go to online school. One reason is that students will not be able to get help due to the fact their is no teacher or any peers to help. Also, kids and teens tend to get very easily distracted and most likely will not get their work done fully. Lastly, students need a break from looking at the screen all day long.

Starting off, teachers play an extremely important role of students learning. The internet can not tell you everything you need to know in life. Yes, it can be helpful to have that resource but it should not be where this generation gets its information. Personally, I have had a very hard time trying to remember information I have read online. Being in class and reading it and hearing the information helps me remember way more. Being in class is very important due to you could miss out of information and the fact you can miss out on little ways to remember things you have learned in class. Whenever you are doing a research paper or you are doing class assignments, if you have a question, a teacher is extremely helpful. It is like teachers know everything you need help with, it is just nice to be able to know you have that resource.

Furthermore, our generation has been quick to hop on social media whenever we get bored. Students are more likely to get distracted at their house than in school. At school, you really have no worries except for getting your work done. In a classroom, your mind can be better at ease. It will help you become in a mind set where you can get the work done and you know what you are doing. Whenever I am at home, I tend to list all of the different things i need to do in my head and I stress out about all of the things I have to do, and I end up not doing them. Or I am running around trying to get everything to do. By the end of the day, I realize that I did not do the important things I needed to do. Being in a school environment has made me work so much harder. School can be difficult, even if you are in a school environment; but by having your peers and your teacher to help you, it is less stressful and having a support system is good.

In conclusion, online school should not be a normally thing students rely on, it should definitely not be allowed unless there is some reasons why you can not be in school. Our generation is smart, we just need to rely on works best. ",0
"Summer Break Experience: Learning to Surf

During my summer break, I had the opportunity to learn how to surf. I had always been fascinated by the idea of riding waves on a board, but had never actually tried it before. I decided to take a surfing lesson at a local beach and it was one of the most exciting and challenging experiences of my summer.

The first day of the lesson was filled with excitement and nervousness. I had never been on a surfboard before and was unsure of what to expect. The instructor showed us the basics of how to stand up on the board and ride a wave, but it took a lot of practice to get it right. I fell off the board multiple times and got swallowed by a few waves, but I was determined to learn.

As the days went by, I began to get the hang of it. I learned how to read the waves and how to position myself on the board to catch them. I also learned how to paddle and how to use my body to move the board. The feeling of riding a wave was indescribable, it was like nothing I had ever experienced before.

The experience of learning to surf has changed me in many ways. I have become more confident and self-assured in my abilities. I have also learned the importance of perseverance and determination. Surfing is not an easy sport, it takes a lot of practice and patience to get good at it. I have also become more aware of the environment and the impact that humans have on it. Surfing requires a deep respect for the ocean and its power, and I have learned to appreciate the beauty and fragility of the natural world.

Overall, learning to surf was one of the most rewarding and challenging experiences of my summer. It taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, self-confidence, and respect for the environment. I will always cherish the memories of riding waves on a surfboard and I hope to continue to improve my skills and explore new opportunities in the future.",1

The pressure on Venus is like the ocen if you go way to far down you get crushed.

"The Seagoing Cowboys Program is giving you an opportunity of a life time and I think you should join becuase you would be helping many people who's countries were left in ruins because of World War II and those people need food supplies,animals and more. You would also take care of cows,horses,and mules.

To get to work for the Seagoing Cowboys Program would be amazing because you wold travel to many different countries. Say like Europe and China and could travel to Greece and see the Acropolis, take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,on the streets of water.

The trip would also be great beacuse you would find some fun stuff do while you're on the boat, like boxing, fencing, baseball, and tennis ball tournaments. But beaing a Seagoing Cowboy is more than just an adventure and plaing games its about helping people and other countries. So I hope you say yes because this trip could open up the world to you, and you could be grateful for the opportunity of this trip. ",0
"The principal of my school has said that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. I think that this requirement is wrong and I disagree with it. There are many reasons why I think this is a bad idea. One big reason is many students do not have someone to take and pick them up after these extra curricular activities. Two other reasons are that it could take away from academics and some students could not afford activities that cost more money.

My first reason for disagreeing with this rule is that some students don't have transportation. For one thing there are buses that pick these students up and take them to school and buses that bring them home after the school day but there are no buses to bring them home after leaving an extra curricular activity after school. I believe that there being no buses is something that hinders many students from participating in after school activities. Because there are no evening buses, students that want to do an after school activity have to be picked up by their parents who may not have time to pick them up because of their work schedule. If a student truly wanted to do an after school activity but their parents couldn't pick them up they could walk home, but for some that would be to far to walk.

I also believe that this as a rule can take away from student academics. This rule is not agreeing with a rule that I have heard from administrators and coaches. That rule is that if you are failing any classes for a certain amount of time you are off the team. Those two rules conflict each other, also a student who may have trouble in school can be subject to much more trouble in school by being forced to do an extra curricular activity. Some students that want to do better and do extra work to get better in subjects and do better in subjects will be hindered by this rule and have less time to get better in their areas of weakness.

My final reason is the money factor. Certain extra curricular activities are free and some cost money. The sad truth is that some students can not afford to do an extra curricular activity that costs money due to their family's economic situation. If a student wants to do an activity that costs money but can not afford to this rule will force them to have to do another activity and some students will feel like they were forced to do their activity because they are poor and that is a bad look for a school and a bad feeling for a student. so economically this rule would be unfair.

To end this essay I will say that I think forcing student to do extra curricular activities is wrong. Doing this can force students to have to walk home or force parents to change their work schedule. Also this rule will conflict with other rules and take away from student academics. Finally, this rule is unfair to the economically challenged. The last I have to say is that I believe this rule is wrong, obnoxious and unfair to students. ",0
"Every summer break, students are given projects in certain classes to make sure they continue to improve over the break.

These projects handed out to the students are always made by the teachers, but what if we change that?

Students should one hundred percent be the ones who plan out and create their own summer projects.

One reason students should be allowed to create their own summer break projects is because, they know exactly what they need to improve on to be ready for the following year.

Students know what they struggled with and what they were good at during the school year.

Teachers can not always grasp what a student may need in order to keep improving. In order for students to recieve any sort of benefit from the summer project, is if they make it themselves.

If I was able to make my own summer project with my classmate I would know what needed to be included in order for me to succeed.

Another reason students would make the summer projects more productive is that, teachers tend to make assignments very long, hard, time consuming, and usually very boring.

Teachers can overstep because it may not seem like a lot of work to them, but to the students, it is.

They can put in too much information which can make it less benificial to the students. Doing a project over summer break that is not productive, is a huge waste of time.

Students might be more willing and excited to do their summer projects if they create it themselves because it will be something they all enjoy doing.

Most people I know, including me dont start even looking at the projects that the teachers give to us until the night before schools starts, but if we as students create our own we already know what we have to accomplish.

Due to the amount of excitment for their projects, there will be a large increase in the number of students who complete the task and get a good grade, which starts the school year off on a good note.

I always tend to work best and work harder on the subjects and or topics I enjoy the most.

I would also complete my work in full if it was intresting to me.

Students deserve a long, stressless summer, but with the teacher's stressful assignments, that might not always happen for them.

All students deserve a say in what they do with their time over their own break.

It is fair to them and the teachers.

The summer break projects created by the students will be more productive, less time consuming and more fun for everyone.       ",0
"One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures representation for smaller states. Proponents argue that without the Electoral College, candidates would focus solely on densely populated areas, neglecting the concerns and needs of rural communities. However, this argument fails to consider the fact that the current system already disadvantages certain states.

For example, in swing states like Ohio or Florida, candidates spend more time and resources campaigning, while states like Wyoming or Vermont receive far less attention. This creates an imbalance, where some citizens' votes hold more weight than others. Additionally, the winner-takes-all system employed by most states further amplifies this imbalance, as a candidate can win a state by a narrow margin but still receive all of its electoral votes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College perpetuates a two-party system and suppresses minority voices. Because third-party candidates face significant barriers in gaining electoral support, voters often feel compelled to choose between two major party candidates, even if neither truly represents their views or values. This system limits the diversity of ideas and perspectives that could come from a more inclusive and proportional representation.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that it can lead to the winner of the popular vote losing the election, as seen in several past instances. This undermines the principle of majority rule and diminishes confidence in the democratic process. It is deeply problematic that an individual can become president without securing the most votes from the American people. This not only delegitimizes the electoral outcome but also disenfranchises millions of voters who may feel that their voices are not being heard or that their votes do not count.

Additionally, the Electoral College fails to account for changing demographics and societal shifts. Its rigid structure, established centuries ago, does not reflect the values and needs of modern America. As the country becomes more diverse and interconnected, the Electoral College's limitations and deficiencies become increasingly apparent.

To address these issues, the United States should consider transitioning to a system that allows for the direct election of the president by popular vote. This would ensure that every vote carries equal weight and that the will of the people is accurately reflected in the outcome. Moreover, it would promote a more inclusive and diverse representation, giving all Americans a voice in determining their leader. There are various proposals for achieving this, such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide.

In conclusion, it is clear that the Electoral College is an outdated and flawed method of choosing the president. By transitioning to a system that respects the principle of majority rule and includes all voices, the United States can strengthen its democracy and ensure that every citizen's vote truly counts. Change is indeed good, especially when it leads to a fairer and more representative electoral process.",1
"The author supports the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", well by giving us ideas on how to get to venus safely, relating Venus to earth and by including information on how exploring from a distance will not work.

The article ""The Challenge of Exploring

Venus"", gives ideas on how to get to venus safely by building vehicles that won't touch the ground due to its hot conditions. In the text it states, "" ...(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus... solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The author writes this to add-on to influence the pursuit by having a safe way to get to Venus.

Futhermore the author supports the idea of exploring Venus being a worthy pursuit by adding information on how it relates to Earth. In the text it states,"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have support various forms of life, jut like Earth."" The text also states,""... Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Relating their challenge to Earth makes readers think about how Venus could have went from Earth-like to a pit of fire.

Additionally, the author supports the idea of exploring Venus despite its dangers by including information on how exploring Venus from a distance will not work. In the text it states,""... hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the group conditions...rendering standard forms on photography... ineffective."" To be able to explore Venus indept they will have to touch ground to explore effectively. In the text it also states,""... researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal..."" The author uses this to show us that exploring Venus for our knowledge means we need to get onto the planets ground not hovering.

In conclusion the author supports this idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit despte the dangers it presents by including valid information to get to the planet safely, relating Venus to Earth and by giving information on why exploring from a distance won't work. To support the reason of Venus being a worthy pursuit the author is giving information to make people want to do something.      ",0
"Having a positive attitude can have immense benefits in both our personal and professional lives. By approaching situations with an optimistic outlook, we are more likely to foster success. One example of this concept is the idea that having a positive attitude helps us to endure challenging circumstances, such as difficult professional deadlines or personal conflicts. Additionally, having a positive attitude can have a positive effect on those around us, as those with a sunny disposition are generally viewed more favorably by others. On the other hand, having a negative attitude can soon become a self-fulfilling prophecy: It may lead to us expecting the worst out of everything, eventually leading to decreased success in life. Having a positive attitude is therefore a key component of a vital and functional life, enabling us to strive for the successes of which we are capable.",1
Policy 1 is better for many reasons. One reason is if a student needs to stay after for a teacher then they can call their parent during lunch and tell them and the parent won't be worried about their child after school. Also if someone needs something at home for a class after lunch they can call there parent at lunch and ask to bring it buy and they wouldn't get a bad grade. The students could call their friends that weren't at school and talk to them and tell them what was happening in class. Also if a person couldn't get there stuff in school at the right time they might be able to call home and ask to bring it to school. A student might want someone to go over their house then they could call at lunch and ask. It helps stop so many kids from asking to call on the office phones. Also there would be less sneaking around with cell phones in school. That's why students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch.,0

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand how you feel about community service, and I too agree it is very important. But some students have things to do like baby-sit for their parents or extra- curricular activities and sports. I do not think community service should be required but it can be an extra-curricular activity. I think you should consider the idea, and take in the fact that students have other important things to do. Jobs of some sort, or helping their parents out.

I believe us students have enough to do already like homework and studying, and we also do like social time and to have fun. Its not very fun to pick up trash with your friends and talk than it is to talk to them at the movies. Now I think it should be the students choice if they would want to pick up trash, or help tutor younger children. That is my strong opinion on the situation.

I also think it could be a punishment for students who misbehave. I mean, who wants to pick up someone else's trash, its gross I think. And students who choose not to pick up trash on their free time shouldn't have to be forced to did it. If they want to pick up trash, it should be because they want to and not because they have to. Please think about it, thank you for your time.

"Technology has become an integral part of modern society, and its impact on our lives cannot be denied. While some argue that technology has negative effects on our society, I believe that it has many positive effects that we should focus on. In this essay, I will discuss some of the ways in which technology has improved our lives and how it continues to do so.

Firstly, technology has revolutionized communication. With the advent of social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing, people can now communicate with each other from anywhere in the world. This has made it easier for people to stay in touch with their loved ones, collaborate with colleagues, and connect with people from different cultures. It has also made it possible for people to access information quickly and easily, which has led to a more informed society.

Secondly, technology has improved healthcare. Medical advancements have led to the development of new treatments, cures, and vaccines for diseases. Technology has also made it easier for doctors to diagnose and treat patients. For example, telemedicine has made it possible for patients to receive medical care from the comfort of their own homes. This has been especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, where social distancing measures have made it difficult for people to access healthcare facilities.

Thirdly, technology has improved education. With the rise of online learning, students can now learn from anywhere in the world. This has made education more accessible and affordable, which has led to a more educated society. Online learning has also made it possible for students to learn at their own pace, which has led to better learning outcomes.

Finally, technology has improved transportation. With the development of self-driving cars, transportation has become safer and more efficient. This has led to fewer accidents and less congestion on the roads, which has improved the quality of life for people. Technology has also made it possible for people to travel faster and cheaper, which has led to more tourism and economic growth.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant positive impact on modern society. It has revolutionized communication, improved healthcare, improved education, and improved transportation. While technology has its drawbacks, we should focus on its positive effects and continue to invest in it to improve our lives.",1
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, you know how teachers are always giving us praise and stuff? Like, when we do good on a test or turn in our homework on time?  Well, I think it's like, super important for our determination and self-confidence, you know?

I mean, when teachers give us praise, it's like they're acknowledging all the hard work we're putting in, and it makes us feel good about ourselves. It's like, they're saying, ""Hey, you're doing a great job! Keep it up!"" And that makes us want to keep working hard and doing better, you know? 

Like, I remember when I got an A on my math test last quarter. My teacher gave me a big ol' smile and said, ""Great job, [Your Name]! You're really putting in the effort."" And I was like, ""Whoa, thanks Mrs. Johnson!  I'm gonna keep studying and get even better!"" And now I'm like, totally motivated to do well in math. 

And it's not just about the grade, either. When teachers give us praise, it's like they're saying, ""You're capable of doing great things!"" And that makes us feel like, ""Hey, maybe I can actually do this!""  Like, I used to be really bad at science, but my teacher would always give me positive feedback and encourage me to keep trying. And now I'm actually starting to get it! 

So, yeah. Praise from teachers is like, super important for our determination and self-confidence. It makes us feel good about ourselves and motivates us to do better. And who doesn't want that?  Right? 

Anyway, that's my essay.  I hope you like it!  Thanks for reading!",1
"To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME:

As of two weeks ago, I understand that you have considered changing the policy of our academic program here at SCHOOL_NAME so that students may not participate in sports or other activities, such as clubs, unless they have at least a B average in all their classes, which is 86 percent or above. I also understand that you would like to hear the opinions of your students about the change.

Of what I have heard, student don't seem to like the change very much but parents agree with the new policy idea. But as for me, I tend to lean towards the idea of the new policy. I agree that students should have to earn the opportunity to be involved with extra curriculum. The case of most students is that they get very involved with the after school activity and they forget that it comes after school. That's why they call it ""after school activity"". Therefore, their grades begin to drop.

Students may think of this policy unfair but at the same time they are working hard to meet the goal to bring all their grades up to a B average. This policy will give our students the determination to be in sports or any other activities and they will care about their schoolwork a whole lot more than before. If all of our students have excellent marks it will also give our school a great reputation.

In conclusion, I agree with your new ideas and I hope that you follow through with them. I'm sure that if you do, you will be happy with the results.

Sincerely,

A student at SCHOOL_NAME",0
" Imagine a world where the school day is extended by two hours every day. While the idea may seem appealing on the surface, the reality is that it would have disastrous consequences for students. Extending the school day would rob students of the time they need to pursue their interests and engage in extracurricular activities, leaving them exhausted and disillusioned with school.

If school were to extend by two hours, students would not have the time or energy to participate in sports teams or clubs. They would be unable to attend practices or games, and would miss out on the social and physical benefits that come with these activities. Furthermore, students would not have the opportunity to engage in hobbies or pursue their passions after school, as they would be too tired to do so.

The consequences of this would be dire. Students would become increasingly disengaged from school, as they would have little to look forward to outside of the classroom. They would be more likely to drop out of school, as they would see no point in continuing their education if they were not able to enjoy their lives outside of the classroom.

Moreover, students would be unable to maintain a healthy work-life balance. They would be expected to attend school for an additional two hours every day, which would take away from the time they could spend with their families and friends. This would lead to strained relationships and a lack of support, which would further exacerbate the stress and exhaustion that students would already be feeling.

In conclusion, it is clear that extending the school day by two hours would not be beneficial for students. It would rob them of the time and energy they need to pursue their interests and engage in extracurricular activities, leaving them exhausted and disillusioned with school. It would also lead to a lack of work-life balance, strained relationships, and a higher likelihood of dropping out of school. Therefore, it is important that we continue to advocate for a standard school day that allows students to have a healthy work-life balance and the opportunity to pursue their passions outside of the classroom.",1
"Rosenthal writes that residents are ""suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before..."". Now, few people would equate soccer moms to such pioneers as Lewis and Clark but in their own way, they kind of are. In many European cities and suburbs, people have almost completely given up driving and cars. As hard as it is to imagine a sprawling city without drive ways and street parking, it is almost forbidden in the cities participating in this experiment.

Everyone knows that cars emit greenhouse gases and it's oh so bad for the environment and blah blah blah, and we all care. We really do. But do we care enough to give up our cars? Most likely not. But we could all stand to limit our driving, and it's easy enough. If the grocery store is only a few blocks away how about riding your bike or walking? You'll get a little exercise and a little less pollution. And while you're taking this walk, imagine the silence you would hear if everybody else was also doing this and the streets were empty. ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (Source 1). Aside from just the noise pollution our buzzing motors give us, the air pollution is much worse. Cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gases in Europe and fifty percent in some North American cities (Source 1). Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world (Source 2) which is known for its intense smog, was almost shown up by the capital of France. Since Paris' government favors diesel over gasoline, they know exactly what was to blame. Closer to home, America's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is due to the transportation industry (Source 4).

On the topic of big cities and driving the first picture that comes to mind is a big highway filled with honking cars and irritated drivers. Traffic. Los Angeles and New York City are only a few prime examples. Heidrun Walter, a mother in the car-less city of Vauban said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1). The stress that driving through congested roads, or even just driving at all can causes a lot of problems such as accidents. Businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, who rides a two-seated bike with his wife says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". In cities with little to no car usage traffic has been dramatically cut down and with it pollution and stress levels. The two day car ban in Paris, France not only cleared smog but brought down congestion, or car traffic. Bogota, Colombia has a population of seven million people who participate in the Day Without Cars to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (Source 3). Regardless of the rainy weather, the decrease in use of cars has sparked the construction of bike paths and new sidewalks.

Minimizing to eradicating car usage would drastically decrease resource use, wasted time and pollution outputs while steadily increasing our own safety. Maybe next time you're ready to jump right in your car, consider another method of transportation.    ",0
"The face that you see on mars was not something created by aliens. Although it may look like a face its not. What you see in this picture is a butte or a mesa. In the following paragraphs I will state reasons helping you undertstand that the pictures effect everything and that it wasnt created by aliens.

The pictures that you have seen are very old. Most of the pictures you have seen where taken from 1976-2001. These pictures have really bad graphics. Things that are old are usaually harder to understand and comperhend. Its hard to see old things clear. Advances in technology have helped us see older things a lot more clear. We can fully understand things from the past now.

The cameras we use today have a lot better grapics. Back then their images could only span 43 meters per pixel. Today our cameras can span 1.56 meters per pixel which is a lot better. This helps us see pictures a lot more clear. We took pictures of the of the face and could see certain things the older cameras couldn't see.

In the new pictures if there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids we would easily see them. There wasn't any of these things. What the picture of the face showed was equivalent to a butte or mesa. It looked like landforms found in the American West. It reminds people of the

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

All the new pictures we have help us undertstand and see things more clear. We now know that it wasn't created by aliens. Its just a simple butte or mesa thats no very special besides the fact that it kind of looks like a face. It reminds people of a Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This face has nothing to do with aliens.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in classrooms because it could make a sudent's work more easy for them to do because it could tell if the student is having a hard time on the work or just does not like the work they were givein like it says in the article.

Another thing it could be valuable for is how a students is feeling lso like if the system see's that a student is feeling unhappy the system could tell the teacher or another student that this student is not in a good mood and that they might need some to go chcek on them.

So those are the resion's why I think the Facial Action Coding System would be valuble in classroom's is that it could tell if a student is having a hard time doing the work or just does not like the work they are doing and another thing is that it could help the teacher or other stundet's know that one of the stundet's is unhappy and that they might need someone help like they are haveing a bad day or they are feeling sick. And so thats why I think the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable for.   ",0
"In my opinion I think the kid's that don't listen to there mom and dad. then They need this program the most. One the older student this telling the younger student what to do. And the older student is acting like there parents. Then if they do the program for like 3 or more time a week then,the younger student will get use to it. And the they will maybe listen to there mom and dad.

How is this program going to help them later on when they have kid's. This is for the older one one. Because he or she is telling younger kids what to do and it pretty much just getting ready when they have kid's later on. And it also teaching they how to respect there orders.

this program is going to help both younger kids and older kids because... Then a older person tells you to something. you should do it. its called respect your orders. Like if u respect other people it dont matter how old you are. You just have to respect older people. And one more time it's just going to prepare the older students when they have kid's. And younger kids how to behave in fort of there parents.

And what i wrote about. Is how is program is going to help they later on in life. How it's going to help both older student and younger student. Also my opinion on who need this program the most.",0
"The electoral college is a very important process in congress. It gives citizens that are in the college a chance to meet the people that will be running for a very powerful position. Sometimes voices arent heard and of these 528 people, some will be humble. its also a good thing that they use a majority ruling system, which can make things easier instead of detailing.

If the voting for election of president was changed to popularity vote only, then it wouldnt be quite as fair. Obviously the president who has apppeared more times on television or at meetings will win. This method screams unfairness. Whichever candidate has more money and funding will obviously become more popular, even if their intentions as president arent as good as the qualities the other candidate's are.

Although both methods by themselves seem a little unfair to work on, i say it would be better to work with both. If you leave it to the electoral college, then only those people will be able to have a say in who we want as president for the united states of america. However if we leave it to just popularity, whoever has more money will get the votes and win.

Some people say that the voice of the people in America is the most important and it really is. What is the point of being in charge of a country where no one is happy and everyone wants to get rid of you? By this standing pount, many people say its critical to use populartiy vote but as i stated before, whoever has more funding will win. But its also unfair to those who have less access to media. Whichever president they hear more about is the one they will unconsiously choose. Or some will rely on the trusting of their party ie. democratic or republican.

Both methods are extremely unfair by themselves, so we should not sigle out a voting process. The way we have it now works perfectly well and should not be changed in my opinion. Taking the overall amount for all the different categories seems like the perfect solution. This way you get an opinion from those in congress, those in the senate, those in the Electoral College and most importantly the voices of the people.    ",0
"Numerous amount of people would love to experience the opportunities of limiting their time with their car. There are a great amount of advantages of limiting car usage. Advantages include having a more healthy environment, decreasing stress, and reducing traffic.

The advantages of limiting car usage is helping the environment. ""passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" While most of the adult population is driving cars everyday, more gas and smoke go into the air and into our environment. This causes pollution and hurts our environment. Paris has a major smog problem in their environment, up to the point where it was nearrecorded. Paris had to then enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The effect of this ban was that congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared after a short week. If we were able to limit our car usage, then our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease. ""In the United States, the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act."" There are numerous environmental agencies that are already starting to act to decrease the car usage in the country. We should limit our car usage because it can greatly help our environment.

If were able to limit our car usage, then it will greatly decrease our stress of driving. Many countries are trying to reduce car usage. An example is Columbia. Columbia has created a carfree day. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses during carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Bogota, Colombia have practiced this day for three years and many colombians have been pleased with it. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Plaza. Without driving, you have the time to go out, be active and get exercise. A huge effect of the car free day is that park and sport centers have been built all throughout Bogota, smoother sidewalks, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. With car usage reduced, it limit people's stress on driving.

If we were able to lower the number of car usage, then our streets would be much safer and there would be less traffic. Many people use cars today and because of that most of streets are usually blocked up. If there were less cars on the streets then it would be easier and quicker to go to places. Vanban, Germany is an example of an carfree town. ""...basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls alond some distant highway."" With less cars on the streets, it can also reduce car accidents and deaths. If there were less cars on the roads, there would be less traffic and car accidents.

There are many advantages of limiting our car usage. These advantages include helping our environment, decreasing stress, and making our roads safer with less traffic.",0
"School is a seemingly never-ending obligation that constantly demands the attention of students all across the nation. Since school is so demanding, missing a day of school could severely harm one's education. If a student misses a day of school, they could miss a key lesson that would have prepared them for a test. Missing school can be unpredictable. A student could wake up sick one morning and not be healthy enough to go to class. Although, if a sick student felt healthy enough to go to school but was still had an illness, the school could deny the student from entering the school for fear that the student could accidentally spread their sickness. However, there are students that simply do not go to school. They may believe that school is a waste of time for them. There are schools that offer distance learning. This provides students the ability to attend a class from their home through a video conference or online connection. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Distance learning would give students another way to become educated by their teachers as well as lessen the issue of students missing school.

Distance learning provides students more opportunities to learn. If a student can't make it to school, they could attend their class on a laptop or tablet and still receive their deserved education. In some cases, students can learn more efficiently while in the comfort of their own home. The school may be a huge distraction for a student. Sometimes, other students in a class can pull another student's attention away from the material that they should be learning. There are others that prefer to work alone and learn faster by themselves. If a student is falling behind in a subject because they can't work as well in a classroom, they would benefit from attending their classes from home. Allowing students to attend classes from home would increase the opportunities for students to receive the education they deserve.

Giving a student access to attend their class even while being sick would be extremely beneficial for that student's learning. Sickness is a major reason why kids in school fall behind. When someone is sick, depending on what illness they obtain, their body needs plenty of time to recover. No one should push themselves to go to school if they feel unwell. However, if they feel like they have enough energy to learn but are still to contagious to attend the classroom, they could attend their classes online. This provides the student time to recover from their sickness and receive learning. A student could also be involved in a car accident or an injury that prohibits the students from walking. Instead of just staying home and missing out on their classes, they could join their class through a video conference and be able to receive their teaching. Offering distance learning to students who cannot attend class would heavily benefit their lives.

Some might say that distance learning would not be beneficial for students who do not wish to attend school and accept the education that they deserve. They might say that allowing students to attend their class from home could lead to some drawbacks. Since there are students who simply do not wish to attend school, they could abuse this privilege. Instead of being required to come to class, they could join online and use the comfort of their home as a distraction. They could be on their cellphones at home and act as if they are listening to the teacher over a conference call. Others might also say that distance learning is not an efficient way for kids in school to learn. Teachers would have more responsibilities and therefore a higher chance of more stress. Students would not have the same teaching experience at home than if they were at school. To others, distance learning could not benefit students.

Students can benefit from being able to attend class from home. All students deserve an education, whether they are at school or at home. Distance learning can provide kids in school with extra opportunity to gain the learning they deserve as well as benefit those who cannot attend a classroom.",0
"As a scientist at NASA and from the research made by other scientists here at NASA I can tell that this here face is nothing more than just a landform. The Face is just a natural landform, it is not created by aliens. Although many people would love to think that the Face wa created by aliens, it is not. The face is widely spred out as far as 2 miles wide. This enomous head has cought a lot of media attention such as being in a Hollywood film, appearing in books, magzines, radio talk shows, and even radio talk shows.

This landform has become a pop icon, but even with all of this attention it doesn't change the fact that it is nothing more than just another mysterious looking landfrom on Mars. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all.""

After 22 years, from this first 1976 Viking 1 photograph pf the Face of Mars there was a picture that was taken of the same face ten times sharper than the original that blew away scientists and web surfers showing that there was no alien monument after all. This shows that the Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural landform on Mars.       ",0
"Technology has a good and bad effects, it allows us complete task without having contact with others. Also just makes things so much easier for us. Technology developed over time so quickly, i remember, i used to had a flip phone but, now there is iphone X. No buttens at all and the face ID. Much as the technology developes the people will be seperated from each other.

Tesla just intreduced Tesla Model X. It has an auto pilot mode. Self driven car. Also they announced they making tunnel just for the auto pilot mode. Elon Musk says ""its much cheaper then the normal tunnel and safer"".

And he mentions on his tweeter ""Working on something"",""flying car picture"". So he is already working on the new tech. It's only 2019, can you imagine how technologies would be in next 10 years?. It will be keep developing and devepoling. It won't stop. We will get to some point, we don't even have too see each other or talk to each other.

Nowadays kids doesn't play outside, they have their IPad, Xbox and PC. Even the babies got IPad. If you give the baby IPad,

the babies would be distracting them selves. It's much easier for the moms too. But some point kinds gets addicted to it. Crying and sometimes they just won't eat anything. Smart phones can be really dangerous to the eyes.

"Ringgggg Ringggggg! *alarm clock goes off* awe jeez school again? Actually maybe not, because some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people may disagree about this idea and they also believe that school builds character among students and disciplines children or some people may actually like attending school *crickets* I don't why anyone in the world would like doing that but lets move on shall we. I actually like the concept of the no school thing it seems really beneficial. You have zero restrictions, if you are sick you can stay home and complete your online tasks, and you have time away from awful teachers. Sounds like a win win situation for everyone!

One thing I really love about this online schooling is that you have no restrictions or rules to follow. Most schools have a policy that if you have six or more unexcused absences, no matter what your grades look like you have legally failed which is really messed up. But if you take online classes you have no absences to worry about. Also you have a lot of free time. For example, in school after you finish you work you have to sit there quietly after everyone finishes their worksheet. Now if you're home alone you have no teacher hassling you for phone or no ones stressing you over work you can work at your own pace and be comfortable in your Elmo pajamas. Lastly you don't have to sit there and hold your bladder because you teacher has a ""1 pass a week rule.""

Secondly, online classes can help you stay on track if you are sick or have a severe illness. For instance, about two and a half years ago I had the flu and I was out of school for about a week or two, so I returned to school only to find out I've missed tons and tons of work. I was so behind and I didn't catch up about three weeks from then. Lastly, online could assist you if your teacher isn't the best at what they do. Most teachers do not really teach their students, they give them little instruction and then they hand out a work sheet and the students have to take the information and piece it together to figure out what to do. Like lets take Generic_Name for example, a math teacher, he doesn't really care if we cheat on our worksheet because he claims he ""taught it to us already.""

Some people may disagree about the idea of online classes. Some people may think public schools help develop character by having friends, interacting with other students, and talking to teachers. Also most parents think children need discipline in their lives which the school provides with the rules and restrictions. Another reason some people may disagree is that some people...may actually.... enjoy school...eh. Despite these reasons, I still support online schooling because it provides us free time, time away from teachers, and freedom from restrictions and rules.

I hoped I help shine some light on why online schooling is an excellents idea. It provides us free time, time away from teachers, and freedom from restrictions and rules. And I hope they bring a program like that to Generic_School very soon. *Mom yells* ""hurry up before you miss the bus!""",0
"Ugh, our principal is so annoying. She's always making these crazy rules and this latest one is the worst! She says we have to do an extracurricular activity. Like, why? I mean, don't get me wrong, some kids like that stuff but me? No thanks. I'd rather just hang out with my friends and maybe watch TV or play video games. I don't need to be doing some boring club or sports team.

Plus, what's the point? I mean, we're all gonna graduate eventually and then what? We gonna be like, ""oh yea, I was president of the chess club in middle school?"" Who cares? No one's gonna care about that in the real world. And what if you're not even good at anything? Like, what if you're just terrible at sports? Then you're just gonna be embarrassing yourself in front of everyone. And don't even get me started on the yearbook. Who wants to spend their free time taking pictures of people's ugly mugs? No thanks.

And the worst part is, if you don't do an extracurricular activity, you'll get in trouble. Like, detention or something. That's not fair. We should be able to do what we want in our free time. I mean, it's our free time, right? We shouldn't have to do something we don't want to do.

I know some kids might like doing that stuff and that's cool. But for me, no thanks. I'll stick to my TV and video games, thank you very much. So, principal, please rethink this decision. It's not fair to make us do something we don't want to do. Let us have our freedom, please!",1
"Many people think that the ""Face"" is actually the work of an ancient civilization that used to, or still might, live on Mars. Those people are proven wrong in many ways. I believe that the Face is not a Martian creation because if NASA knew about it, they would tell people so that they would get more publicity and make more money.

Also, after a higher resolution picture was taken of the face, it was clear that there was no sign of equipment near the face to build it. Lastly, Jim Garvin, who is a Mars expert, said, after long research, that the Face is just a landform.

The first reason people should be able to tell that the Face is not a Martian creation is that NASA would tell people about the chance of Alien life on Mars. That fantasy has been around for hundreds of years! Books and movies have stories of Aliens from Mars. There would be many more sales for NASA. Therefore, it is obvious that NASA would tell the public if there really was a chance of Martian excistence.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a photograph of the Head that was tens times sharperthan the first picture taken by the Viking. Many anxious web surfers where waiting for the image to appear on the JPL web site. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no sign of aliens at all. Concluding the reason as to why the Face is just a coax.

The third and final reason as to why the Face is fraud is that scientist Jim Garvin said that the Face is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which means landforms common around the American West. He said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face which appears on The Red Planet.

Now many people may argue that the picture was taken when it a cloudy time of the year in Mars - the picture may not have been able to see everything around the face. But, according to Garvin, you can discern things in a digital picture three times bigger than the pixel size so if there even were objets in the picture that showed any sign of excistence, you would be able to see them. Therefore there is no possoble way of a human or Martian building the Face.

So, the many people in the world that believe that the Face on Mars is actually a creation of living beings, they are proven wrong. Multiple reasons point to the Face just being a landform that just so happens to be in the shape of a face. Not only would it take forever to make a face that is two miles long, it would also take supplies - which were not found. Furthermore, the Face on Mars is not a Martian creation.   ",0
"Dear Principal,

I believe all students should not have to complete community service tasks .I believe all students should have the option weather or not they want to put in physical labor for their community .Any student who puts in work for the community should otherwise be rewarded for their effort .Also for the students who choose not to participate in these efforts will have to be an inhabitant to the problems and concerns .everyone should have the option and have the right to take act on their choice .

For any and every student who chooses to take part in the clean up or involvement in bettering young children education I feel they should be rewarded . In the form of a game night , party , or even a cook-out perhaps .The children who fight and feel the need to have a safe ,healthy ,smart ,concerned community should be taken care of in a fun way .Because they take time away from their fun. This will maybe even show other children how important it is to do the same and might have a positive influence on them.

As for the students who choose not to take time away from their social lives to make a better community should not be punished or held on a lower pedestal .They should be treated the same and they should be able to realize on their own the opportunities they're missing out on .If there is a certain in -school activity that they will miss out on then that is a way that they can be influenced to participate .But there are some students who can't or aren't able to help the community .No-one should really have to explain themselves because the fact of the matter is if they choose to live in this type of community and live in this type of environment then they have to deal with the consequences.

"Required Essay: Phones and Driving

The use of cell phones and other handheld devices make daily life in the 21st century easier and more convenient than it has ever been. However, attachment to these devices can distract individuals from their surroundings causing a number of problems. Mainly, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle has a great potential to cause accidents. Alternative hands free devices such as bluetooth headsets can keep a driver's eyes on the road while also being able to communicate as necessary.

If a driver is using their cell phone, it means that their visual focus has become divided and the potential for an accident is greatly increased. According to The United States Department of Transportation, cellphones are the cause of 1.6 million car crashes per year in the U.S. Driving a car requires a certain amount of focus, coordination, and reflexes in order to drive safely. Humans can only focus on so much at once, so unnecessary operation of a cellular device is highly advised against when doing something as potentially dangerous as driving.

Hands free accessories are the perfect alternative for people who absolutely need to be communicating while driving. Headsets and bluetooth screens integrated in to some cars are relatively safe compared to blatant texting while driving. While a study done by the University of Utah displays evidence that using these hands free devices can incapacitate a driver even more than alcohol, having a set of eyes on the road is still better than none at all.

When driving, the best way to avoid an accident is to not communicate via a cellular device in any way. Laws against using cell phones when driving should remain in place and continue to be enforced. Not only do they put the driver in danger, they put everyone else on the road in danger as well.    ",0

A computer desgined to read or emotions on calculate emotions, facial expressions, and impressive calculations no bodody needs a computer to read what we our feeling.

When someone asks if your ok from what they are seeing from your eyes face or acting they try to help they dont calculate emotions for someone. In paragraph 2 ""how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"".

Do we type what makes us sad and a robot answers with a question or something silly or something out of subject for the answer. In paragraph 3 ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"".

If it just looks at the human muscles than theres in issue becuase we could be hurt and not be sad, or something else it could just be we hurt something or just lost a tooth we don't need the calculations to tell us how we feel.

Facial expressions is when we are show if we are happy, sad, angry, and surpirisesd. In paragraph 4 "" emotions are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like smiling broadly)."" Everyone can read peoples expressions unless they just look the same everyday of the week. Therapists are trained for this to see how people are to read to see how they feel if they feel bad or good. In paragraph 4 ""By weighting the diffrent units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)"". The computer might be better for paintings made by people or even a pictures in a book, and games.

We can preform impressive calculations in our lives to help each other everyday. In paragraph 5

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look non her face."" Not everyone is good at looking at facial expressions or how somone is acting out if someone takes the time to help there friends out or even somebody they can see that they can read emotions well enough without a computer.

The conclusion is we dont need machines helping us with our emotions. If we do we gotten lazy or even just they cant read it or they dont want to read the facial expression on there face. Some of us are glad we can help others for not ourselves without the help of tech we dint need tech in every part of our lives. What we need is people that can help or even want to help us out. The computer is looking for what we normally hunt for when making sure someone is ok we dont need it to calculate emotions for us, looking into our facial expressions, and we can perform impressive calculations on our own if we try to       ",0
"Dear principal ,

This letter would be to try to inform you about the issue that has been notified . Such as the new ""Phone Policy"" as you know there are two rule's in which you are trying to decide and so I hope this letter can help you decide into making the right choice .

My opinion , about the ""Phone Policy #2 ""

would be that it should be selected . The reason would be because many students often don't pay attention during schools when having a distraction in their hands. Policy #1 does state to let kids use phone's during free times or so and to turn off their phone's during class sessions . Now it's not a bad idea but the problem would be that some students would not just turn their phones off when entering class because some of them don't really follow the rules as you know . Second , of all if students are let to have the freedom into having their phones in free times they can be texting each other the test answers or so . These would obviously be a major issue within School education system . Now if the #2 policy is chosen then students would not have the distraction of checking or playing around with their phones during class times or texting about tests answers or , homework answers . By this happening the students would have the ability of paying attention to their lessons as they are commanded to do .

Many kids take their phones to call their parents for when to pick them up or an emergency . Now if they need a phone for one of those emergencies they can use the office phone where there can be a supervisor that would secure that they are using the phone for a good purpose. As you may know parents send their students to learn and so in some situations this doesn't happen because kids are getting often distracted with their ""Technology! ""

In conclusion , that would be my opion about what policy should be selected for the school . Well thhis only explains my opion about it but at the end the final desciocion is yo

"I believe that zoos should continue to operate because they play an important role in conservation and education. One reason for this is that zoos provide a safe environment for endangered species to live and breed. For example, the black-footed ferret was once thought to be extinct in the wild, but thanks to breeding programs in zoos, they have been reintroduced into their natural habitat.

Another reason why zoos are important is that they educate people about animals and their habitats. Many people may never have the opportunity to see these animals in the wild, so zoos provide a chance for them to learn about different species and the challenges they face in their natural environments. Zoos also offer educational programs for school groups, which can help inspire the next generation of conservationists.

However, some argue against the continued operation of zoos, claiming that they are cruel and inhumane. While it's true that some zoos have had issues with animal welfare in the past, many modern zoos prioritize the well-being of their animals. They provide spacious enclosures, nutritious diets, and enrichment activities to keep the animals mentally stimulated.

In conclusion, I believe that zoos should continue to operate because of their vital role in conservation and education. As long as they prioritize animal welfare and work towards preserving endangered species, zoos can be a force for good in our world.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have a dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur. I have always been fascinated by the idea of creating my own business and being my own boss. However, I know that achieving this dream will not be easy. In order to become a successful entrepreneur, I will need to have a solid plan in place.

The first step in achieving my dream is to identify a need in the market that I can fulfill. I will need to conduct market research and identify a problem that people are willing to pay for a solution to. For example, I could start a business that provides eco-friendly cleaning products to households and businesses. This would align with my passion for sustainability and the growing demand for eco-friendly products.

Once I have identified a need in the market, I will need to create a business plan. This will include outlining my goals, target market, marketing strategy, and financial projections. I will also need to secure funding for my business, which could come from a variety of sources such as loans, grants, or investors.

One potential obstacle that I may face is competition from established businesses in the market. To overcome this, I will need to differentiate my business and offer a unique product or service that sets me apart from the competition. For example, I could focus on offering personalized cleaning services or using innovative cleaning technologies that are not currently available in the market.

Another potential obstacle is the risk of failure. Starting a business is never a guarantee of success, and there will be times when I may face setbacks or failures. To overcome this, I will need to be resilient and learn from my mistakes. I will also need to have a support system in place, such as a mentor or business advisor, who can provide guidance and advice during difficult times.

There are many successful entrepreneurs who have achieved their dreams by following a similar path. For example, Elon Musk started Tesla with the goal of creating sustainable transportation and energy solutions. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, Tesla has become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Similarly, Sara Blakely started Spanx with the goal of creating a comfortable and stylish undergarment for women. Today, Spanx is a billion-dollar company that has revolutionized the undergarment industry.

"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that studying Venus is worth the danger it presents. The author supports this idea by providing examples of the difficulties in exploring Venus and the benefits of doing so.

The author explains that Venus is a challenging planet to explore due to its harsh environment. The planet's thick atmosphere, extreme heat, and pressure make it difficult to send probes and rovers to its surface. The author also mentions that Venus's surface is covered in volcanic rocks and has no signs of water, making it an inhospitable environment for humans.

Despite these challenges, the author argues that exploring Venus is still a worthy pursuit. The planet's proximity to Earth, similar size, and composition make it an ideal candidate for studying planetary formation and evolution. Additionally, studying Venus's atmosphere could provide insights into climate change and the greenhouse effect.

The author supports this argument by citing recent missions to Venus, such as the Venus Express and the Pioneer Venus missions. These missions have provided valuable data on Venus's atmosphere, magnetic field, and geology. The author also mentions future missions, such as the proposed Venus Mobile Explorer, which could provide even more detailed information about the planet.

Overall, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By providing examples of the challenges and benefits of exploring Venus, the author makes a compelling case for continued research and exploration of the planet.

In conclusion, the author's argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit is well-supported by evidence from the article. Despite the dangers and difficulties in exploring the planet, the potential benefits make it an important area of research for scientists. By continuing to study Venus, we can gain valuable insights into our own planet and the universe as a whole.",1
"Being productive and being idle are two different ways of living that can have a significant impact on personal development and success. While productivity is often associated with success, being idle can also have positive effects on personal development.

Productivity is often seen as a positive trait that leads to success. It involves being focused, organized, and efficient in completing tasks. Being productive can lead to the completion of important goals and the achievement of success. However, productivity can also have negative effects on personal development. When individuals are too focused on productivity, they may neglect their mental and physical health, leading to burnout and stress. Additionally, productivity can lead to a lack of creativity and innovation, as individuals may be too focused on completing tasks efficiently rather than exploring new ideas.

On the other hand, being idle can have positive effects on personal development. When individuals are not constantly working, they have time to reflect on their lives and pursue personal interests. This can lead to personal growth and self-discovery. Additionally, being idle can lead to increased creativity and innovation, as individuals have time to explore new ideas and think outside the box. However, being idle can also have negative effects on personal development. When individuals are not working, they may become lazy and unmotivated, leading to a lack of progress and personal growth.

In conclusion, both productivity and being idle can have positive and negative effects on personal development and success. While productivity is often associated with success, being idle can also lead to personal growth and self-discovery. It is important for individuals to find a balance between productivity and being idle, and to prioritize their mental and physical health in order to achieve personal development and success.",1
"In Vauban, Germany, citizens have made the decision to not use cars. To some people, this may be something that they could never imagine themselves doing, becuase it would make life more complicted. However, these people are pleased with their decision and would not have it any other way. Furthermore, there are many advatages to making this change. By limiting car usage, citizens can improve their own health and economic state.

By making the decision to stop using cars, one can become healthier, both mentally and physically. One citizen who has already taken this step said,""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way'"" (Rosenthal 3). Many people who chose to limit their car usage, decided to walk or ride bikes instead. By chosing the alternative, they are less stressed. There is something soothing about walking down the road in a quiet and peaceful environment. Walking gives one time to reflect and think, while driving requires concentration and can be stressful. In addition to improving one's mental health, limiting car usage can also improve one's physical health. Pollution from the air can take a tolll on someone's physical health and the environment around them. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal 5). Pollution poisions the air of most cities where people live and breathing the pollution is not healthy for an individual. In cities like Beijing, inhabitants wear air filters over their mouths in hopes fo escaping the pollution. Limiting car uage can help improve air quality quickly. For example, after having multiple days of intense smog, Paris decided to ban cars with even-numbered plates for one day. After this one day of limited car usage, ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer 19).

Another advantage to limiting cars is that it could mean economic improvememt for individuls and countries. The banning of cars can mean improvement in the appearance of cities, which can have positive impacts on the economy of cities. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; unevem, pitted sidewalks have beeen replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" (Selsky 28). These improvements in the city can draw more people to them and stimulate the economy in places that have had difficulty before. In addition, individuals can save money by carpooling, biking, walking, or using public transit as an alternative optopn to driving. During the 2013 rececession, people were forced to sell their cars due to lack of money. However, after they recovered from this, they decided not to return to car usage due to their content in the lifestyle they had chosen (Rosenthal 32)

In conclusion, limiting one's usage of cars can have only positive impacts on one's life. This decision can have lasting impacts one's happiness, the environment, and the economy.    ",0
"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" presents a compelling argument for why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While Venus may be one of the most inhospitable places in our solar system, the author makes a convincing case that it is still worth exploring.

One way the author supports this idea is by highlighting the many scientific questions that can only be answered by studying Venus. For example, Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. By studying this extreme climate, scientists can gain insights into the greenhouse effect and how it might impact Earth's climate. Additionally, Venus is similar in size and composition to Earth, making it a valuable laboratory for studying planetary science.

Another way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit is by discussing the technological challenges that must be overcome. For example, Venus's thick atmosphere makes it difficult to land spacecraft on its surface. However, the author argues that these challenges are precisely what make studying Venus so valuable. By developing new technologies to explore Venus, scientists can learn how to overcome similar challenges on other planets, including Mars and even exoplanets.

Finally, the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by acknowledging the risks involved. For example, Venus's extreme climate makes it a dangerous place for human explorers. However, the author argues that the potential rewards of exploring Venus outweigh these risks. By studying Venus, scientists can gain a better understanding of our solar system and the universe as a whole.

In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case for why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By highlighting the scientific questions that can only be answered by exploring Venus, discussing the technological challenges that must be overcome, and acknowledging the risks involved, the author provides a well-supported argument that is both convincing and informative.

"""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be imited by by dangers and doubts but should expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This quote is by the author who is suggesting that studying Venus is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers it presents. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tells you about the risks of traveling to Venus, but how the exploration has value. The author could scare some readers instead of supporting his idea that Venus should be explored. The author does not support his idea well enough for people to be convinced that Venus should be explored despite the risks.

Venus has many challenges and dangerous characteristics, too dangerous for humans to travel and explore. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets, and clouds of ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid."" The author states all these facts about Venus, and all of them describe a planet that is too dangerous to be explored. The author is not ""supporting"" his idea when stating these things, but he does support it when he states that Venus is the most ""Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" because he is trying to get readers excited about exploring Venus. The author does not say these ideas enough for readers to find visiting Venus worthy.

The author suggests alternatives for traveling to the solar system, like hovering Venus, but these conditions are still dangerous to humans. We would only get limited insight if we did trial this idea. Also, researchers could not get samples of anything from the planet. The author also states that NASA is looking for other approaches like mechanical computers in the 1800s and 1940s, but the author also states that these computer may not be able to withstand the physical conditions of Venus. The author states these alternatives, but all of them have a down side that would not give enough information to the researchers.

The author does not give enough information about why we should take the risk of studying Venus. The author states many good insights about how our planet Earth and Venus are ""twins"", and how Venus has enough value to explore it. As readers, we see only the disadvantages the author states. For example, how hot Venus is, and how no human could possibly live if they went on the surface. Not only does the author state dangerous facts about Venus, he also states alternatives about how researchers could maybe find information about the planet. These altenatives however, don't satisfy what we want to figure out about Venus. If we sent people to hover safely above the planet, then we would only get limited insight. The author did not give enough supporting factors to the readers about exploring this dangerous planet.    ",0
"Dear Principal,

I believe that only allowing students with a grade average of at least a B is unfair. Students should be able to participate in the activities they enjoy no matter what, and they should not be discriminated if their grades aren't at the tip of the peak.

There are few sources in town besides school that these kids can take part in a sport or other activity, and taking away their activities that they enjoy is taking away their rights.

If a student has low grades, but loves basketball with all their heart, It would be terrible to take that away from them. Everybody is good at something, and bad at others, it's part of being human. A student may not have the best grades, because education may be their weakness and athletics is their strength.

I believe that in the long run, it is important that a student is successful in their future life. If someone was set on pursuing an athletic career, why do they have to have excellent grades in classes. As long as they are trying their best in school, they deserve their rights. A proper education is very important for success, but if they are the best in what they want to do for the rest of their lives, that should be all that matters.

What may improve the grades of athletes is scheduling practices at convenient times, which allow them to get all their school work completed before practice. Doing so will allow the students to focus more on their work. Another option is to cut practices shorter. If they are not as long, students will have more time to do the things they need to in order to help their grades.

It is important that kids stay healthy and active, and not allowing them to play sports is depriving them of exercise that is needed for them to grow. People who exercise on a regular bases are happier people, and of course, healthier people.

I hope you take my concern into consideration, because I know many other students who would agree with a lot of the things I mentioned.

Sincerely,

"When faced with an important decision, it is wise to seek input from more than one trusted source. Getting different perspectives allows you to consider the decision from multiple angles and uncover aspects you might not have thought of on your own. While one person's advice could be biased or overlook key factors, hearing from several people balances out those individual limitations. 

Talking to friends, family members, teachers or other advisors who know you well can provide invaluable counsel. Each person may have had relevant experiences to draw from or notice subtle details that could sway the outcome. Combining their recommendations helps paint a fuller picture of the pros and cons to weigh. People also think about problems in various ways, so multiple minds brainstorming increases the chances of creative solutions.

Importantly, seeking a diversity of views guards against narrow or short-sighted thinking. Our own judgments can be clouded by personal wants, emotions or preconceived notions. Multiple advisors are less likely to all overlook the same key considerations. Their guidance helps test the soundness of our initial instincts before committing to a path of action. You also avoid relying too heavily on just one potentially flawed assessment. 

Discerning the agreements and disagreements across the feedback gives valuable clarity. Common recommendations are strongly supported as sensible. Identifying outlier advice allows you to carefully re-examine dissenting perspectives rather than simply dismiss them. With a broader base of input, your decision-making is strengthened and you can feel more confident that all significant factors have been duly weighted. The security of balanced counsel provides peace of mind that your choice is well-informed and prudent.

In conclusion, input from multiple trusted sources is invaluable when confronting important choices. It results in more comprehensive insight and reduces reliance on potentially flawed or narrow perspectives. Taking the time to consider a variety of viewpoints strengthens decisions and provides reassurance that all aspects were suitably examined before determining the optimal course. Seeking multiple opinions is therefore advisable for making choices with comprehensive wisdom and care.",1

"imagine a world, twenety or so yeears from now, completely free of any nature. there is not a single tree, bush, flower or even a blade of grass to be found. only concrete roads and dirt everywhere, along with our cars driving on them. in the cars are us, fat lazy peoplle sitting in our cars, irritated and hollering out profanity at the mile long row of traffic as we try to get ot work. the cause of all this is toxic gases emited by our cars. this is our future. do we really want this to happen to us and ouur beautiful planet earth? i know i don't, and thats why all around the world, cities and even entire countires are doing something about it, they are working on cutting back peoples' vehicle usage, or even eliminnating it. without the cars, there would be a drastic decrease in polution, peoples' physical health would improve, and no more stress.

we all use cars, it has become a daily thing for all of us. we have become so acustomed to driving that we don't even think about it. we never thought about just how much damage our cars were doing on our home, planet earth. cars are the leading source of polution, everyday the polution is ripping awway at our ozone layer, slowly dooming us all and we are definnatly feeling the heat from it. places such as Vauban, Germany, have given up cars completely. in this experimental district, street parking, driveways and home garages are forbiden and, except for the main thoroughfare, the streets are commpletely car free. thanks to this, greenhouse gases in this area have gone down. residents of this town don't even seem to mind the car free life, they even enjoy it. having clean air makes this district a beautiful placce to live in.

not havinf motor vehicles also can immprove physical health. humans, especially Americans, have become incredably lazy, and as a result, incredably fat. no one has time in their busy schedual to excersize. everyone is too busy with work, school, kids, chores, or anythinng else. but, if we all got rid of cars and people either walked to and from their destinations, we would all be losing weight, be more aactive and be so muuch helthier. also, the helthier you are, the longer you live, so getting rid of cars will increase your life span!

having a car can also mean having a lot of stress. theres traffic backing you up making you an hour late for work, high gas prices sucking all the money out nof your wallets, expensive repair prices, and you are always putting your life at risk if you get into an accident. all this to think about while your just trying to get from point A to point B can be very stress full. but if everyone walked or biked to and from wherever, there would be much less traffic, no need for gas, the only repairs you would have to get is pumping more air in your tires, the onnly accident you might have is runninng your bike into another's bike and as long as you wear the right protectionn gear, you are very safe.

all of these factors add up to a safer, cleaner, helthier environment. if we all start now to eliminate cars, theworld would bbe a much bbetter pllace.    ",0
"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy. I believe that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, which is Policy 1.

Firstly, cell phones can be very useful in case of emergencies. If a student needs to contact their parents or guardians quickly, having a cell phone at hand can help them do that easily. This is especially important in cases where a student might need to leave school early or in the event of an emergency.

Secondly, cell phones can be used for educational purposes. There are many apps and websites that can help with schoolwork, and having access to these resources can be very helpful for students. Additionally, students can use their phones to take pictures of notes or assignments, which can help them with their homework.

Finally, allowing students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times can give them a well-deserved break from schoolwork. They can use this time to relax, listen to music, or play games on their phones, which can help them to recharge and be more productive during class time.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better option for our school's cell phone policy. It would allow students to have access to their phones in case of emergencies, give them a well-deserved break, and provide access to educational resources.

Sincerely,
A concerned grade 6 student.",1
"If Generic_Name takes all of his classes at school, he very easily could get sick of it! Students like him wish that there is another way of learning. Many students do not enjoy spending all of their time during the day at school and would rather have the option to stay at home and learn. Despite the fact that people say students would not benefit from being able to take classes from home, the reality is that students would indefinitely benefit from being able to attend classes online and at home because students can relax while learning, have more free time, and can work at their own pace.

Above all, students benefit from being able to learn from home because they have the ability to relax while learning. If a student is relaxed, they will be in a better mood, which will cause them to learn more efficiently. Survey says that 89% of students would rather be relaxed while learning, instead of going to school, sit in a chair all day, and listen to their teacher speak. A high schooler's dream is to stay in bed all day and relax. If they have the ability to learn from home, a student's dream will come true.

Also of note, students benefit from being able to learn from home because they have more free time. Free time to students is extremely important. Free time can be spent with family, exercising, or even hanging out with friends, which are all very important activities for a high school student. If students were forced to sit in a classroom all day, there is no time to do those activities. Additionally, teachers give a lot of work to students and sometimes, there isn't any free time after school to even talk to their families! Students need free time to survive and having the ability learn from home is a perfect solution.

Furthermore, students benefit from being able to learn from home because they can work at their own pace. Teachers nowadays enjoy rushing through topics. Very often, students do not pick up on the topics because they get far behind, which causes them to stress. With online classes from home, students have the ability to work at their own pace which will not only reduce stress, but will greatly improve their learning.

Overall, students would indefinitely benefit from being able to attend classes online and at home because students can relax while learning, have more free time, and can work at their own pace. This affects almost everyone because students that have the ability to stay home are always happy. You know what they say, if a student is happy, everyone around them will be happy. Go ahead and shoot an email to your local principal to recommend the idea of giving students the ability to take classes from home because it will make you happy, and everyone else happy!",0
"The way that the author had wrote this is with facts that he has gained and compairing Venus to Earth and the type of environment it has and had.

Starting off the author had explained what is important to know about Venus in paragraph two. When the author explanins the atmosphere of the planet and the degrees it can reach there. As well as how harsh the environment can be with the earthquakes, heat, high pressure, volcanos and frequent lightning. This supports ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" because the author wants the readers to understand how hard it can be to explore somewhere like Venus. Then in paragraph four the author was explaing yes Venus has rocky sediment and once was covered in large water. It was a long time ago and probably isn't safe there anymore. The author continues on into paragraph five, explaining that it is a bad idea for NASA to send people to Venus with the harsh conditions. The author continues on in that save paragraph understandind that the air pressure is not safe nor the level of heat that Venus can reach. On the other hand in paragraph seven the author talks about how NASA is finding alternative wasy to exlpore Venus. Such as, having a drone orbit the plant for observation, some simplified electrons made of silicon carbide, and mechanical computers.

In conclusion the author supported the paragraph with the amount of evidence they had provided and as well as the way they grabbed their reader atteniom. They were writing for someone who had an idea of knowing more about venus and that is what they did. ",0
"Working in a group and working alone have their own set of benefits and challenges. While working alone allows for more focus and control over one's work, working in a group can provide cultural appreciation, better communication, and the ability to complete a task on time. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits and challenges of working in a group and working alone, and argue that working in groups is beneficial.

One of the main benefits of working in a group is cultural appreciation. When working in a group, individuals from different backgrounds and cultures come together to work towards a common goal. This exposure to different cultures and ways of thinking can broaden one's perspective and increase understanding and empathy for others. For example, when working on a group project in my history class, we had members from different countries and regions. We shared our cultural traditions and customs, which helped us appreciate and understand each other's perspectives.

Another benefit of working in a group is better communication. When working alone, it can be easy to become isolated and disconnected from others. However, when working in a group, individuals have the opportunity to communicate and collaborate with others. This can lead to better ideas and solutions, as well as a more efficient and effective work process. For example, when working on a group project in my science class, we had to discuss and debate different hypotheses. This encouraged us to think critically and communicate our ideas effectively, leading to a better understanding of the subject matter.

Finally, working in a group can help individuals complete a task on time. When working alone, it can be easy to procrastinate and fall behind schedule. However, when working in a group, individuals are accountable for their work and can rely on others to help them stay on track. This can lead to a more efficient and effective work process, as well as a higher quality final product. For example, when working on a group project in my English class, we had a strict deadline. We divided the work evenly among the group members, and each member was responsible for completing their portion on time. This ensured that the project was completed on time and to a high standard.

In conclusion, working in a group has its own set of benefits and challenges. While working alone allows for more focus and control over one's work, working in a group can provide cultural appreciation, better communication, and the ability",1

While some argue that using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, others believe it raises ethical concerns. In this essay, I will argue that the use of FACS in the classroom is not only valuable but also has the potential to improve the learning experience for students.

One of the primary benefits of using FACS in the classroom is that it allows teachers to better understand their students' emotional states. By tracking facial expressions, teachers can identify students who may be struggling or feeling overwhelmed, allowing them to provide additional support and guidance. This can be particularly helpful for students who may not feel comfortable expressing their emotions verbally or who may not have access to support outside of the classroom. Additionally, FACS can help teachers identify students who are excelling and provide them with opportunities for further enrichment.

Another benefit of FACS is that it can help create a more positive learning environment. By monitoring facial expressions, teachers can identify moments of excitement or joy and use that information to tailor their lessons to meet the needs and interests of their students. This can lead to a more engaging and interactive learning experience, which can ultimately improve student outcomes.

Furthermore, FACS can also help reduce bullying and other negative behaviors in the classroom. By tracking facial expressions, teachers can identify students who may be exhibiting signs of distress or discomfort, allowing them to intervene and address the issue before it escalates. This can create a safer and more supportive learning environment for all students.

While some may argue that FACS raises ethical concerns, such as privacy and data security, these concerns can be addressed through proper implementation and oversight. Teachers can ensure that students are aware of the technology and have the option to opt-out if they choose. Additionally, data collected through FACS can be anonymized and used for aggregate analysis, ensuring that individual student data is not compromised.

In conclusion, the use of FACS in the classroom is a valuable tool that can improve the learning experience for students. By allowing teachers to better understand their students' emotional states, creating a more positive learning environment, and reducing negative behaviors, FACS has the potential to make a significant impact on education. While ethical concerns should be considered, they can be addressed through proper implementation and oversight. Ultimately, the benefits of FACS outweigh the risks, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn.",1
"The current system of the electoral college undermines the principles of democracy and denies the voting rights of millions of Americans. It is time for a change. By transitioning to a popular vote system, we can ensure that every citizen's vote truly matters and that the will of the people is reflected in the election of the president.

One of the main arguments against the electoral college is its inherent unfairness. Under the winner-takes-all system, candidates only focus on swing states, neglecting those that are already considered safe for one party. As a result, voters in these non-competitive states are denied the opportunity to see the candidates, hear their policies, and engage in meaningful political discourse. This creates a system that favors certain states over others, leaving many Americans feeling disempowered and voiceless.

Furthermore, the electoral college has the potential to disregard the will of the people. As witnessed in history, there have been instances where electors have voted against their party's candidate or attempted to manipulate the outcome of the election. This goes against the fundamental principle of democracy, where the power to elect the president lies with the citizens, not with a group of electors who may have their own agendas.

While proponents of the electoral college argue that it provides certainty of outcome and prevents the need for runoff elections, these supposed benefits pale in comparison to the importance of individual voting rights. The essence of democracy lies in the ability of every citizen to have their voice heard and their vote counted. The electoral college undermines this basic principle by diluting the impact of individual votes and creating a system that can override the popular vote.

Transitioning to a popular vote system would not only ensure the fairness and integrity of our elections, but also increase voter turnout and civic engagement. When citizens know that their votes truly matter, they are more likely to actively participate in the democratic process. This would lead to a more informed and engaged electorate, strengthening our democracy as a whole.

It is time to align our electoral process with the principles of popular sovereignty and equal representation. We must prioritize the voices and votes of every American citizen, regardless of their geographical location. By adopting a popular vote system, we can create a more inclusive and democratic electoral process that truly reflects the will of the people.

In conclusion, the electoral college is an antiquated system that undermines the fundamental principles of democracy. By transitioning to a popular vote system, we can ensure that every citizen's vote is counted equally and that the president of the United States is elected based on the will of the people. It is time to embrace change and prioritize the empowerment of all Americans in the election of our nation's leader.",1
"Dear,Principal

I am writing this letter to you to try and change your decision on requiring students to make community service mandatory. I believe that community service should be a chance to help the community, to boost a grade or to just help the school in general, but it shouldn't have to be a mandatory grade or activity. Community service is meant to help the community not give a student a grade, if that person chooses to not help then we should let him/her be, not give the person a bad grade. I personally do not think it would do much harm to us, but if you were to make this a requirement I'm sure there would be many students who would disagree and just skip the class or show up and not even do anything. In conclusion I would like for you to just please take this letter in to consideration and I know i am just one student, but I'm sure a lot of other students would agree with me.

Sincerely,

"In the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars''

NASA talks about how a spacecraft was circling the planet mars snapping possible landing sites for another spacecraft. When it suddenly spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face it seemed to be smiling back at the cameras.

The likeness face of a human most of been a rock formation as said in the article or a landing of an spacecrft or even from a take off but there so no such thing as aliens that would do that or they don't even exists. They even mentioned in the artilce how the cameras on board of MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face clearly but skeptics a different thing. That pobably aliens makings were being hidden by the haze. Which were not likely it could of been the air,because the human like face was located in the north martian latitude where it was already winter. It could of been the breeze from the snow.

Who would think that aliens would do that if they knew we were going to spot it evenutly. The picture that was taken in 2001 was more bigger and more proseize on what we would of been looking at then it was in 1976. The picture that was taken in 2001 made people see that there was nothing to worry about and that it was just a rock looking like a face. People even made it famous without knowing what it was at the time but then people saw the picture takened in 2001 that they had nothing be afraid of or suprised.",0
"Dear Principal,

Have you ever played sports? If you have then you know how hard your coach expects you to work. So, I think that making each student have a B average isn't such a bad idea. If a student cannot keep a B average, then the student shouldn't be playing a sport anyway.

First, when playing a sport, you should know that school and grades always come first. It doesn't matter how good you are or if you like school or not. I play three sports, baseball, football, and basketball, and I still maintain straight A' s. In fact, I have never had a B. So, having to have a B average is a great Idea.

Second, sports are good for you because they keep you in shape. But there is something else, if you want to go to college or have a decent job in your future, then grades are more important. I am not saying kids should quit sports, because many love playing. I am saying that kids playing sports should have a tutor or extra help in class if they need it. They aren't receiving special treatment, they just have a lot going on.

Lastly, you were a kid once, and you know how the athletic kids are most likely the cool kids. So, maybe you or the counselor need to talk to them and explain how much more important grades are than sports. A lot of the players don't realize that, if there was a study session before games or practice, and they did it as a team, then they would improve a lot. Most kids, when working together rather than alone will do twice as good. So if I were you, I would make them work for a B average, but I would also do other things like study sessions also.

I know you were a kid once, so bring it to the kids realization that grades are more important. You need to put forth some effort, and they will too. Then maybe in the future, you can get even more help for them and raise the standards to an A average. You should really make the students work. Thank you, and I think that the students like the idea or having a B average.

Sincerely,

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Hey, y'all! Today I'm gonna talk about why older and younger students should be paired together. I think it's a pretty cool idea, and I'm gonna tell you why.

First of all, older students can teach younger students new things. Like, I'm in 8th grade now, but I was in 6th grade last year, so I know what it's like to be a younger student. And let me tell you, I learned a lot from my older friends. They taught me how to play new video games, how to do cool tricks on my skateboard, and even how to make better grilled cheese sandwiches. It was super helpful, and I'm sure younger students would love to learn from their older peers too.

But it's not just about learning new things. Being paired with older students can also help younger students feel more confident. Like, when I was in 6th grade, I was really shy and didn't talk much in class. But then I started hanging out with my older friend, and he would talk for me when I didn't know what to say. It made me feel so much more comfortable, and now I'm not scared to speak up in class at all. I bet younger students would feel the same way if they had older buddies to hang out with.

Another reason why older and younger students should be paired together is because it helps them understand different perspectives. Like, older students have been around longer, so they've seen more things and have more life experience. And younger students are still learning and discovering new things. When they're paired together, they can learn from each other and understand each other's viewpoints. It's like, older students can teach younger students about responsibility and independence, and younger students can teach older students about creativity and imagination.

Okay, I know some people might be thinking, ""But won't older students be bored with younger students?"" Or, ""Won't younger students be annoying to older students?"" But I think that's not fair. Older students can still learn from younger students, and younger students can still",1
"It is said that, over summer break students tend to forget the majority of what they learned during the school year. Once the year begins, their teachers advise them to use the information given from the classes taken prior to assist them. It should be out of the question, that students need to do school work during their 2 month-long summer vacation. The question at hand is, who should be in charge of creating these summer assignments, the teachers or the students? The apparent solution is that the teachers should be assigning these projects because they have credibility in their subject and a knowledge of how students work based off of experience.

Firstly, a teacher has a certain credibility that students do not. The goal of these assignments is to help the students fortify their knowledge over summer so that it is not lost. These teachers go through years of university studying the subject that they teach, so why should a student who has taken the class for one year have authority over summer assignments. For example, AP BC Calculus is an immense subject with a variety of different units of math. If a student tried to make a summer study guide, they would only have a year of experience under their belt. On the other hand, teachers, who have been teaching/studying this subject for years, have a strong understanding of each unit and how to teach it in a unique way. The credibility of the creator of the assignment must be strong, so the student can have an easier time understanding the subject. Thus, teachers should be assigning summer assignments.

Following my previous statement, teachers who have been working with students for years know the best strategies for getting students to absorb the subject. Many students have a hard time grasping a topic. If students decide to ask a colleague before a teacher, they have the chance of getting incorrect information or no help at all. For example, many students in the AP Computer Science course have to figure out problems of which have many different solution. Students who don't want to give away their specific answer will try to help students figure out a secondary solution. Unfortunately, most students will not be able to figure out a second solution, because they don't have enough experience. Once the student asks the teacher for help, the teacher will be able to help the student find a solution because of their expertise. Therefore, teachers can offer a more valuable source of knowledge that will stick with the student.

Although the student designing the assignment knows how other students' brain works, they don't have the experience that teachers have. Students designing assignments don't know exactly how to get through to students who do not know how to do the work. On the other hand, Teachers who have been working with students for years will know how to get a student to grasp the topics. Therefore, teachers designing assignments will know how to mold the assignment into a more enjoyable experience.

In conclusion, the efforts that teachers put into their own education provides strong evidence that teachers should be creating and assigning summer assignments. The years teachers spend in school give them the required credibility that is nessasary for students to trust teachers' judgement. Also, the effort teachers put into their work, to make sure their students are able to understand the topic, comes from their experience as teachers. Use these points to figure out that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial than student-based assignments.",0
"The use of cellphones today has increased dramatically over time almost everyone owns a cellular device and has become addicted to being on it. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing a raise to people's insurance, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation. Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year caused by from by texting. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving while using a cell phone while drunk and driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accidents and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.

Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.   ",0
"With daily advances in technology, the education system is shifting towards a more modern approach: going online. Students are no longer opening their textbooks, but now it's their laptops that are cracking open. While online school seems to be full of positives, the negatives such as the social aspect of school missing, the escape from at-home problems that students rely on school for, and the inconsistency of technology are some big red flags opposing the switch.

Generic_Name's school has turned completely online. She is halfway through high school, and the new and sudden change is drastically effecting her. Now that her curriculum is online she is not able to see her friends during school, and the lack of social interaction is starting to effect her mental health. She feels depressed, but does not want to draw attention to herself for ask for help because she feels like she has no one anymore. School is more than math class, and English projects. School is a way for students to connect with other people.

Generic_Name spends most of his days out of the house away from his computer. Since Generic_Name has no one to check up on him to make sure his assignments get done he simply does not complete them. Generic_Name is now in danger of not graduating. He has an IEP plan, that, while he physically went to school, granted him a teacher's aide in all of his classrooms. He formed a close bond with that teacher and the teacher helped keep him on task. Generic_Name now spends his time on other things, like leisure activities and seeing his friends. Students who need extra help would not find online school beneficial, and it would be difficult for them to keep up with their intrinsic motivation to learn without that extra push from an outside source. School itself is mentally taxing, but can provide a physical escape for students as well.

Generic_Name is the oldest of five , and has to share a room with her younger sister. They often fight and bicker and sometimes Generic_Name just needs a break. She often will go to a friends house, but her biggest escape is school. Being away from all the drama at home for hours at a time really helps Generic_Name, and helps her reset before spending the evening with her siblings . She is calmer and more patient with her siblings when she goes to school. But Generic_Name's county has shifted all the schools to online, and all day Generic_Name has to help her siblings with homework questions and looking after them all. Whether their home life is great or not so great it is a way to just leave the house and expel energy.

Generic_Name and his father do not get along very well. Generic_Name is an only child, and his mother is not in his life. His father takes out a lot of his frustration out on Generic_Name, ad Generic_Name loathes being at home. Normally he would spend as much time as he could away from his house, participating in after-school clubs, coming into school early, and just going places with his friends. But now his school is online. So he is constantly inside of the area that gives him his stress and anxiety and it is not good for him. Generic_Name feels as if he is walking on pins and needles all the time. School is a get away for students. Having school online does not work for every family dynamic.

Problems at home are not always with another person, rather they could be with technology.

Generic_Name spilled creme soda all over his laptop. His computer is out of commission for a week and he has no way to complete his assignments or email his teacher to explain what is going on. Generic_Name has a test this week that is worth a very large percentage of his grade, and he needs to have his laptop to be able to do it. This problem will cause Generic_Name's grade in the class to drop dramatically if his laptop is at the repair shop. Technology is too inconsistent to rely on outside of the classroom on a large scale.

Generic_Name's family cannot afford for her to have her own personal laptop. Her schooling is now being conducted only online however, and she is having difficulties keeping up with her schooling. She relies on the public library for computer access, but it isn't always open when she needs it to be, and she cannot video chat with her professors there. Generic_Name's grades are plummeting but she feels like she has no control over the situation. She has decided to get a job in order to pay for her own laptop, but her job drastically cuts into her schooling. She needs the hours to acquire the laptop but her balance between work and school isn't working and she doesn't know what to do.

Switching to online school can cause new stress on students.

Some could argue that online school could be beneficial to students by ways transportation. In climate weather, over crowding in schools, and just day to day traffic causes back-ups and problems in students getting to school on time. Students wake up late, and are caught up with adults trying to make it to work or miss the bus and must ask a parents for a ride. However making it necessary for children to come to school teaches students independence and self-reliance, clears all distractions away from students by having them sit in a classroom, and allows time for students to ask teachers questions about topics that they do not understand before class begins, giving the student one-on-one time. Having students stay home, gives them no accountability besides to themselves, which does not guarantee attendance to school. Students can sleep in, not turn on their computers and no one is there to check them.

Having school online would not be beneficial to students. Children's needs are to diverse and learning styles so drastic that to conform the millions of students in the U.S. alone to one way of learning is unrealistic and unhelpful. Children need the peer-to-peer interaction, the escape from their households, and the constituency of resources that school provides. Personal learning tailored to every student works best for equal education for every child, not having them stuck behind a screen.",0
"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity.

Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide.

Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life.

My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college.

go to school guys and stay in school.",0
"The elecotral college was a good solution many years ago to have a compromise between the election of President by Congress and to have the election of President by popular vote. Today, we have found flaws in the system.

To begin with, we fought many years to make voting right equal no matter your race, sex, or wealth. Shouldn't we keep that in mind, it would be more fair if everyone's individual vote counted. We shouln't have to let soemone vote for us. After we made this an equal country we should keep it that way.

In addition, some states have more people than others and if they only get a certain amount of voters not everyone really gets a say in the election. Therefor, if everyone gets their own vote the in the election the winner is truely who the citizens want to win. The number of electors can't make everybody in the state happy. Also, the ""My vote counted"" stickers you get after you vote aren't completly true in this system.

Next, we even have a name for what might happen... the disastor factor. You can't garuntee that the elector you vote for will elect who you want to really win. In this case you could elect oppent and not even realize it. If everyone's individual votes counted that would be solved, you know exactly who you are voting for.

In conclusion, the electoral college was a good idea many years ago. It made many years of voting easier but, now we see the flaws in it. The best way to elect the leader of our country is to have everyone have an equal vote.    ",0
"Ok, now how would you like to have a car that drives itself? I'm talking soon, like next 5-10 years. Sounds great, sounds real futuristic, but I just know those things can't be successful anytime soon. Personally, I would love to ride in a driverless car one day but that's a huge risk to take.

To start off with, a driverless car does sound prety cool. I mean it coulld introduce so many oppurtunities for the world that we've never seen yet. A driverless car could be the start of something new. Like Google cofounder Serge Brin believes, such cars could change the world fundamentally.

In counterclaim to that, THERE WILL NEVER BE A COMPLETELY DRIVERLESS CAR! Well, at least that's how I see it. I mean a driverless car, I know it's 2016, but that's going past the limits. It's all pure imagination if someone believes a driverless car will be accepted into the streets of the world.

There's only one HUGE reason I say it won't happen though... A driverless car will never be safe enough to count on. I mean be real, would you ride in a plane wth no pilot with only computed sensors telling you what's going on around your plane? What's going to happen if one of those sensors on the car don't react one time? Like I know everyone has had a surprise mishap with a computer-generated system before. Think if your car caught a virus or something or just was being used too much, your on the road, then our car starts going crazy and drives off the road. Who's fault will it be? What if someone gets hurt because of your car, not you or the car's manufacturer, but your car?

In conclusion to all this, I think it's a brilliant idea to have. It definitely presents many arguments, but I wouldn't be in a driverless car even if it was my only choice. I wouldn't want my life in the hands of a technological device or machine or whatever it'd be called. ",0
"I think community service should be something everyone does to help others, or to help the Earth. Some people think community service is a waste of time, but when the air is polluted, and more people get sick per week or day from it, it is time to start cleaning up are community!

I think the help of the elementary kids would be great for them, so they can get work done, and not just have to ask the teacher for help, but they can ask their tutor also. Also, they can go home after school, and have no work with a tutors help. The tutor would feel good at the end since the student they helped enjoyed the help of the work, and also enjoy meeting someone new to them.

The community need to be cleaned up so our air pollution can get better than what it is right now. We should have a couple kids clean up places during study hall hours, and after school. Also, the lakes, rivers, and oceans are getting polluted from all the junk in the water. So all the fish, turtles, and other sea creatures are dying from the pollution thrown onto the ground, which can get blown into the water, or thrown into the water. I think we should have kids recycle paper and other recyclable items to reuse them, instead of cutting down trees for the paper, and make the new items.

The schools should have a Recycling competition where the Study hall class that brings in the most items to be recycled, get a free day party for the study hall the whole week. The competition goes on each month. After each month, they have an assembly to get all the items collected, then they put them together to see how much they recycled that month. It would encourage kids to recycle more often, and give a little bit of a competition for the school.

Community service is a good thing to help clean environment, and also help other who need it. If we didn't have community service, our community and planet would be a wreck. We need more people to help for community service so it can go by faster each day, and makes others feel good about where they live. If we didn't have community service, you would mostly be walking on trash every step you take, since some people throw their trash on the floor instead of a trash or dumpster.

Some people dislike community service since they like to be inside the whole day either in front of a television, on a computer, or playing a video game. So they think community service is boring and not worth their time, but they need to learn that they can save the environment by just picking up a wrapper on the ground, and spending time away from the electronics, and go outside with friends, or pick up trash in their neighborhood.

The people that do community service, should be proud of what they do to help others, and keep up the work they do. So I think all students should perform community service so we have an excellent environment, and more people can look at teens, and not think of them as a bad reputation like adults do right now. They think of some teens as trouble, bratty, and they don't do anything. But other teens are getting looked up to by doing different amounts of work to help out, and also adults think they are a good reputation since they help out more.

Community service is a good deed, and not only kids should do it, adults should also be doing some community service since it is something that is excellent for the community. They put responsibility on kids to clean up, even though adults throw things on the floor too.",0
"When planning a birthday party, one of the most important decisions is choosing a theme. A good theme can make the party more enjoyable, memorable, and visually appealing. In this essay, I will talk to someone about what theme would be good for a birthday party, research different color combinations to use for a birthday party, ask friends and family their opinion on what theme I should choose, consider ideas from more than one person when deciding on a theme, and determine which theme could work well for a birthday party.

Firstly, I talked to someone about what theme would be good for a birthday party. They suggested a few different options, including a sports theme, a movie theme, and a beach theme. Each of these themes has its own unique appeal and could make for a fun party. However, I decided to do some research to see what other people thought.

After doing some research, I found that there are many different color combinations that could work well for a birthday party. For example, a sports theme could use colors like blue, green, and red, while a movie theme could use colors like black, white, and silver. A beach theme could use colors like blue, green, and sand. Ultimately, the color combination will depend on the theme and the preferences of the person planning the party.

I also asked my friends and family their opinion on what theme I should choose. Some of them suggested a sports theme, while others suggested a movie or beach theme. I took all of their suggestions into consideration when making my final decision.

After considering all of the options, I decided to go with a sports theme for my birthday party. I think that this theme would be fun and engaging for everyone, and the color combination of blue, green, and red would work well with the theme. I also think that a sports theme would be easy to decorate and would provide plenty of opportunities for activities and games.

In conclusion, choosing a theme for a birthday party is an important decision that should be made carefully. After talking to someone, researching different color combinations, asking friends and family for their opinions, and considering multiple ideas, I have determined that a sports theme would be the best option for my birthday party. I am excited to plan and decorate the party, and I am sure that it will be a huge success.",1
"It is often said that first impressions are everything, and they can have a powerful influence on how we view another person. But is it always the case that first impressions are accurate? The truth is, first impressions can change after we get to know a person. This has been supported both by personal experiences and factual evidence.

On a personal level, I have found that sometimes my first impressions of someone have proven to be inaccurate after getting to know them better. A few years ago, I met someone who immediately rubbed me the wrong way. On the surface, they seemed cocky and rude. But as I got to know them better, this person eventually became one of my closest friends. It turns out, they were actually quite humble and kind, and I was glad that I decided to give them a chance despite my first impressions.

This idea has also been supported by academic research. In a 2012 study, researchers asked participants to watch brief videos of strangers and form an impression. The study found that the more information participants had about the persons in the video, the more their first impression changed. These findings suggest that the more interaction we have with someone, the more our initial impression of them may change.

Overall, it appears that first impressions are not always an accurate indicator of someone's personality or character. This is why it is important to look beyond the surface of any person and get to know them better. All too often, a knee-jerk reaction to a first impression can lead to judgments that are not entirely valid and might be better described as an educated guess.",1
"Sometime staying home from school can feel great; It gives you time to fully wake up and enjoy your morning. Going to school can feel tiring because you do it 5 days a week. Some students would say they would rather stay home than actually coming, or maybe even working from home is better then being in school. Mostly because classes could be boring, you barely learn, or hard to focus on with all distractions in the room. Most schools allow you to work online and video conference with teachers for work. This could benefit you in many ways. Attending classes from home could help provide extra help and fitting doing your work into the day, improve knowledge, or being able to focus more in a quiet environment.

You ever needed extra help in a class but the teacher was too busy to assist you cause they're working with others. A video conference call would help that a one on one call, or class conference. More time for repeated instructions and more time to work on problems than rushing through them. Being able to record the call for later references on work and being able to not be distracted by friends. Fitting your work into your day meaning your able to work in the morning or midday. Manages time for your online school classes cause it could be at the same time everyday. You would still be learning the same thing as everyone else just a little different cause your home.

Benefits you by improving your knowledge. Makes you learn faster by understanding the information. Lots of online help meaning more websites to figure out how to do the work. Better ways of spending your time then to sit in a classroom and just talk to others and barely get work done. It would grab the attention of students because being on the computers could be fun and depending on the lesson it could be something for them to engage in and want to learn more. That makes students do their work more, when its more fun. A quiet place gives you your space that is needed to work and an calm environment. Gets you more focus because everything could be heard better without over talking.

Some disadvantages about taking classes from home would be the same for being in school taking classes. Like you would need to turn work in on time for proper grading, the connection for your computer could go out or be messed up, or even it would be hard to learn or wouldn't feel the same as being in a class. Despite my reason taking classes at home are bad it's still a good thing that could benefit you in the end. It still has it ways of being challenging. Whos's to say it has to be easy to get better at it. The more you conference the better you get at asking for help and interacting with others, such as the teacher. Also multiply ways of getting it done and strategies.

Taking your classes at home would be the best benefit here. Basically you could take your time for work help understand things. Improve how much you get to sleep rather than to wake up early in the day. More space and quiet time to listen and learn. Students would say working at home is better than being at school. Although our friends would be there at school and we would be at home it still helps us get what we need done finished. Each school should have a choice of working at home or attending your regular classes during the day. ",0
"I feel like it should and here's why. First of all what happen is someone is depress and dont want to tell anyone about it so they kill their self because they're depress the facial Action Coding System could have help that poor boy or girl because someone would ask her what's wrong and talk about it with him or her and know they feel that someone there for them and how much they're needed and wanted so they don't kill there self matter as fact there are happy right now because someone is there for them and they feel wanted and they can love life agian. My evidence why I wrote that satatment is the passage it said ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry"" I think everyone should have this because it could save a lot of people lives because so many people take their lives away so fast and young because of depresion and lot are teens if high schools and jr high haves these i feel like it would change the world for the better. Some peolpe don't like it mabye it's because they're the stress ones that need help and think that no one cares and is to scared to show they're depress and they rather keep to them self. My oppoion is that every school and family doctor should have this to save lives and more.",0
"Three pictures were taken of this odd feature on the land of Mars. The reasoning for the interest of the pictures is because they think the figure of the shape is a face. The first time they saw it they were astonished and had many questions that they sent other spacecrafts to take pictures two other different times. I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural formed mound and scientist need to stop listening to theories.

One reason to stop looking for a civilization is because it is not important. Mars Global Surveyor even said that finding the face is hard work itself because we dont even pass over the Face very often. We don't need to wasting our time on something that is not going to affect us here on Earth. Also, after the discovery and the first picture was taken it was just a landform not an alien momument that some people predicted or hoped to be.

Second, if you look at the pictures you see a difference in all three of them. If there was an ancient civilization wouldn't you think the pictures would be more extravagent each time after the first. What we see is the complete opposite of what was just explained. As each picture gets newer the face looks much more deteriorated than before. They face is practically gone by the third picture and there is nothing really of it to say that it was a face.

Lastly, Even if there were airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or things smaller you could see them from the cameras. So don't you think that if there were people on the planet you would also see them as well in the other three photos.

I can see where some people might be interested in the idea of there being people on another planet. It would be awesome to know that you could or can survive on another planet knowing if something happens to the one we are on now. We could even add more information on alien research NASA has been doing.

In conclusion, the Face did turn out to be a mesa and or butte. The same thing as a mesa but a lava dome and just maybe happened to be the same height as the Face on Mars. Also, the pictures you could tell it wasn't a face the dome shaped thing didn't match the features of the far away picture of the Face.          ",0
"Should we operate a cell phone while driving?

Operating a cell while driving has always been a problem nationwide .The amount of people who think its ok operate a cell phone is ridiculous. The national safety council reports that 1.6 million crashes happen each year because of a person using their cell phone while driving. Most of the reasons why there is so many crashes is people can't wait to text their friends and end up getting distracted. Which leads them to hitting something or someone it's just sad that people can't wait to text their friends.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 meters per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you. Other figures suggest that someone dumb enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.

My conclusion is that every time you drive while using your cell phone. You not only put yourself in danger but you put the people around you in danger as well I rather see you live another day. We all know it's tempting sometimes to cheek if we got a message or who is calling us but that little second can change your whole life. That's why some people recommend you turn off your phone or put you phone on vibrate so that you won't be to tempted to pick up your phone. Look driving in the highways is dangers because of all the accidents that happen and by you using your cell phone makes it more dangers then it already is. The phone can easily be replaced if dropped or squashed but a live human being cannot.       ",0
"Working at a local bakery has always appealed to me, and I believe that I am suited for the role on so many levels. Firstly, I have always loved experimenting with ingredients and recipes – something I think could be perfect for a bakery setting. This love of experimenting means that I am very open to learning new things and have a real enthusiasm for different flavours, styles, and methods.

I also think I would relish the opportunity to make new friends in the local community by working at a local bakery. Bakers and customers alike are an important part of any bakery, and I think it would be great to forge relationships with regulars and simply talk shop with like-minded bakers.

Finally, I believe I have the energy and enthusiasm required to successfully showcase this local bakery to potential employers. From working tirelessly to craft the perfect product, to thinking proactively about marketing strategies, I have confidence in my ability to take the bakery to a new level of success.

In conclusion, I am drawn to the idea of working in a local bakery and am confident I could integrate quickly into the role and make a positive impact.",1
"The use of cell phones in the classroom has become a hotly debated topic in recent years. While some argue that cell phones can be a distraction and negatively impact academic performance, others argue that they can be a valuable tool for enhancing engagement and learning. In this essay, I will explore the effects of cell phone use in the classroom and investigate potential solutions to make it more effective.

Firstly, it is important to understand the correlation between screen time and educational success. Several studies have shown that excessive screen time can lead to decreased cognitive function, attention deficit, and academic performance. For example, a study conducted by the University of California, Irvine found that students who spent more than two hours a day on their phones had lower grades and were less engaged in class than those who spent less time on their phones (Lin, 2016). However, it is also important to note that not all screen time is created equal. When used appropriately, cell phones can be a valuable tool for enhancing learning and engagement.

One potential solution to make the use of cell phones in the classroom more effective is to implement guidelines and rules for their use. For example, teachers could establish specific times during the day when students are allowed to use their phones for educational purposes, such as research or collaboration. Additionally, teachers could require students to use their phones to complete assignments or participate in class discussions. By setting clear expectations and guidelines, teachers can help ensure that cell phones are used in a way that supports academic performance and engagement.

Another solution is to provide students with access to educational apps and resources. There are many apps available that can help students learn and engage with material in new and innovative ways. For example, educational apps can provide interactive quizzes, games, and simulations that help students understand complex concepts. By providing students with access to these resources, teachers can help them take advantage of the benefits of cell phone use while minimizing its potential negative effects.

In conclusion, the use of cell phones in the classroom can have both positive and negative effects on academic performance and engagement. While excessive screen time can lead to decreased cognitive function and attention deficit, when used appropriately, cell phones can be a valuable tool for enhancing learning and engagement. To make the use of cell phones in the classroom more effective, teachers should implement guidelines and rules for their use, provide students with access to educational apps and resources,",1
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents to humans that even get near the planet. Even with the dangers that are poised against those who would go near Venus, there is still intrigue in the planet from our simple human nature, the opporatunity of studing an Earth like planet besides our own, and the fact that Venus is so close to Earth.

The main reason of studying the planet Venus is capitalized by the article and the author in this quote ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" The Author also simply puts in the article that humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus all unmanned.

Another reason for the intrigue in studing Venus is our simple human nature. In another quote by the author and in the article ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense. The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like.

The author suggested studying Venus would be a wirthy pursuit despite the dangers. I say they actually supported their idea thoroughly in the end. There also seems to be no error in the logic of the author either.         ",0
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Teachers are brilliant, and have many degrees in what they study; therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for work, and teachers know their students capabilities; however, others could say that summer projects should not be teacher-designed.

First, summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for their work. As a student, it is hard for a teacher to go home and tell someone to do a summer project. I would need all the following information: details, when it's due, specifics, how long it has to be, etc. Doing a project over the summer isn't always the most fun thing to do, but it is for the purpose of a student keeping their knowledge over the summer. Not a lot of teachers want their students to have summer work, but teachers also don't want their students coming back to school the next year not having any knowledge because they didn't do their summer project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for their work.

Second, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what their students can and can't do. Every class has their stronger students and their weaker students. Teachers can design to the point of where it's manageable for every person in their class to do it. If a summer project were to be teacher-designed, then they would have the power to do everything. A teachers job is to do these types of things, so there is no reason for a teacher to put pressure on the student to make a summer project. Teachers know what their students are capable of, so the students shouldn't have a hard time doing a project in their capabilities. There are so many options that teachers have, and students have the most bright and brilliant brains in the world. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what their students can and can't do.

On the other hand, others could say that summer projects should not be teacher-designed. Making a summer project student-designed would let the student be free, and give the student the opportunity to do whatever he/she wants. Letting a student design a project on his/her own, can lead to many things. Students could take things to far in the project, they could end up making up something that isn't school appropriate. There are too many things that go on in a students mind. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

In conclusion, being a student is not of the greatest thing in the world. Not a lot of students enjoy school, and half the time the teachers don't as well. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students rely on their teachers for their work, and teacher know what their students can and can't do; however, others could say that summer projects should not be teacher-designed. Teachers have control in what they do for their students. Teachers make these projects so their students don't lose their knowledge over the summer. Teachers are brilliant, and have many degrees in what they study; therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the current system for electing the President of the United States. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College system rather than changing to an election by popular vote. While the Electoral College has its flaws, it serves as a necessary compromise and has several advantages that outweigh the potential disadvantages.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, for example, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only received 51.3% of the popular vote. This demonstrates how the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College creates a clear winner, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in disputes if the winning candidate only had a slight plurality, leading to contested results and undermining trust in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is everyone's president. No region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal and encourages them to campaign in all parts of the country. By ensuring that candidates seek support from diverse regions, the Electoral College promotes national unity and gives voters in every state a stake in the election. This is a desirable outcome as it prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and making certain regions feel disenfranchised.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the importance of swing states. Under the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, candidates focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention from the candidates and have a greater opportunity to engage with them. These swing states tend to have more thoughtful voters who pay close attention to the issues and are more likely to make an informed decision. By allowing swing states to have a significant impact on the election outcome, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a greater say in choosing the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores the weight of large states in the political balance. The allocation of electoral votes is based on each state's population, which gives more weight to large states. This compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate and ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and issues of voters in large states. Without the Electoral College, candidates would likely focus on campaigning heavily in densely populated areas, neglecting the interests and needs of citizens in less populated states. The Electoral College guarantees a more balanced distribution of attention and resources from presidential candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College still produces a clear winner. This prevents the complication and cost of run-off elections, which can be time-consuming and result in prolonged political uncertainty. The Electoral College ensures that a candidate who achieves a majority in the Electoral College becomes the president, providing stability to our democratic system.

I understand that the current system may have some drawbacks, such as the winner-take-all approach which can result in candidates focusing on swing states and neglecting others. However, the advantages of the Electoral College in terms of certainty of outcome, national unity, focus on swing states, representation of large states, and avoidance of run-off elections make it a more effective and fair system for electing the president.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College system. While it may not be perfect, it strikes a balance between popular will and the need for stability and representation. Changing to a national popular vote system would undermine the purpose of the electoral process and ignore the diverse needs and interests of different states and regions. I believe that the Electoral College provides a more comprehensive and equitable approach to presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College system in the best interest of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"In his famous quote, Thomas Jefferson says that ""Labor is Prior to and Independent of Capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the Superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."" Through this quote, Jefferson emphasizes the importance of hard work and communicates the idea that being idle is not a desirable quality. This idea can be applied to various practical scenarios. For example, in the workplace, employees who are idle will not produce desirable results, so it is important that they stay engaged in their work. In addition, in a student's academic journey, being idle will prevent them from achieving their educational goals, so it is important to stay focused and motivated. Ultimately, Jefferson's quote holds true - labor is essential and being idle will prove to be ineffective in practical scenarios.",1
"Cars are a basic need for people today we use them to go from point A to point B in the fastest way posible. But one must ask themselves ""do i really need the car?"", ""would i be better off without one?"", how do you tell people that what they have depended on for movement could be hurting them. I believe that cars should have a limited usage in cities because cars affect our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas, they cause smog to form around cities, and cause us to move through life at the fastest pase posible. A limited car usage would change the way we see the world its beauty, its adventersm, and we would be able to save the world from our distruction.

There is a community in Germany called Vauban where people have given up their cars. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, 57% sold their cars just to move to Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much hapier this way,"" media trainer and mother of two Heidrun Walter says in the artical ""In German Subuerb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"". Also the artical states that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and responsible for up to 50% in the United States. Vauban houses up to 5,500 resident within a rectangular square mile, which makes it posibly the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life, stores are placed just a short walk away so that no car is needed.

Smog; a thick layer of black fog that hurts your lungs and can even kill you. Paris had to ban driving due to smog , cars with even numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive one day and the following day cars with odd numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive. 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters and 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction to the fine. This statement from the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" show that cars are responsible for a gas that can kill people, and that people dont respond well to being told what to do. In one week the ban was lifted because the smog had cleared enough but not all the way, just a week of limited car usage cleared the skys imagin what a year of it would do.

Cars have us going the fastest we can and people have started to live that way through life. In Bogota they have a day free of cars every years like its a holiday. People left their keys on the counter and insted hiked, biked, skated and took the bus. Even in the rain people didnt use their cars, "" The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" says Bogata Mayor Antanas Mockus. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". The quotes from the artical "" Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" show that with out cars people feel realeved of stress and are able to have a good time.

In conclusion limited car usage would help us presurve the world and create a enviroment that could help people aswell. Cars are one of the most used products in the world people might not want to give up their cars but eventually might have to. Smog and greenhouse gas are caused by car overuseage and hurt the enviroment and people. Limited car usage is posably the only answer to helping the world live longer aside from buying a hybrid car.    ",0
"Hello, fellow citizens! Have you ever thought about the advantages of limiting car usage? I know it might seem like a strange idea at first, but hear me out.

First of all, let's talk about the environment. Cars produce a lot of pollution, which can be harmful to our planet. According to the passage set, cars produce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in the air and help slow down climate change. Plus, less cars on the road means less noise pollution, which can make our communities quieter and more peaceful.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it's better for our health. Walking, biking, or using public transportation instead of driving can help us get more exercise and stay healthy. According to the passage set, physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. By limiting car usage, we can encourage people to be more active and reduce their risk of these diseases.

Limiting car usage can also help our communities become more connected. When we walk or bike, we're more likely to interact with our neighbors and local businesses. We can say hi to each other, wave, or even stop and chat. This can help build a sense of community and make our neighborhoods feel more friendly and welcoming. According to the passage set, social connections are important for our mental health and well-being.

Finally, limiting car usage can save us money! According to the passage set, the cost of owning and maintaining a car can be really expensive. By using alternative modes of transportation, we can save money on gas, maintenance, and parking. Plus, many cities offer affordable public transportation options, which can be a cheaper alternative to driving.

So, what can we do to limit car usage? One idea is to encourage alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, and public transportation. We can also promote carpooling or using ride-sharing services. Additionally, we can support policies that discourage driving, like increasing parking fees or implementing congestion pricing.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages, including reducing pollution, improving our health, building stronger communities, and saving us money. By making a few changes to our daily routines, we can make a big difference in the long run. So, let's try to reduce our reliance on cars and make our communities healthier, quieter, and more connected. Thank you for reading!",1
"The use of driveless cars can be defined as a statement of stupidity in your world today. They are not the way to the future as what this article say it is. All people need to have complete contorl of the wheel at all times. We learned that at a very young age and it needs to stick with us.

My position on this blanketed idea is that we in America should not have this type of car. There are many reasons for this ordeal. In the use of a drivelss car, many people would think to not even have to worry about driving the car since it can do it by themselves. So what happens if the car malfuncitons and the driver is asleep, then what happens, a crash, a death. That is a one reason on why we should not have these cars.

Another reason would be, the income and cost on these cars. The article doesn't state this material, but in order to make these cars so that they are drivelss, it would cost a lot more money than making an ordinary car. And the manufature has to sell it, so people are going to spend a lot more money than they have to on a car that they can drive by themselves. The money is not worth the risk.

Also google has stated that the car is not in complete control, a driver in needed. So, by this statement if a driver is needed then why do we need drivless cars if a driver is needed. Do we need them so people can text and call when they please, we have bluetooth cars for those situations. Also GM has pointed that, that in order for a car to be in complete control of the wheel, it needs roads that can read it's binary code. The government will not settle for any smart-road system because of how much it would cost.

The best reason out of all of them would be, who would be responsible for the crash, the car or the driver. If there were no such thing as driverless cars, then the situation would be taken care of right away, there would be no contraversy. Since now that we have these cars the quesiton is thrown up into the air, was the driver driving at the time of the crash, or was the car in it's automotive estate. In later days, this brings up court ruling and huge contraversy in which no one wants to be apart of. Just another good reason why we should't have driverless cars.

These cars today, that the world is making, that are driveless are absolutly dangerous in lives of the people. Injuries could come way to often with malfuntions inside the vehicle. Also the cost of roads and the car itself is extremely high. No one wants to pay for that unless your rich. And also, contraversy between the car and the human involving a crash would bring up big headlines. The world needs to stay with a human driving a car. It is safer, less expensive, and also easier to handle by the law. ",0
"Summer projects are a great way to keep students learning over the summer. Some students may find them tedious, but they are actually very beneficial by keeping the students' minds working over their extended break. But, when teachers assign such projects, sometimes they are not interesting nor engaging for the students. Thus, the interesting projects over summer break should be based on the student's interest in a subject, and not determined by a teacher, who may choose a topic that the student is not interested in.

Often times during the school year, students take classes on subjects which they are not interested in in order to improve their college applications; this should not be the case for summer projects. The summer is a time for students to take a break from the rigorous math and English classes they took during the school year, and relax and do the things that they love. Therefore, to keep students engaged in their summer projects, they should determine what sort of work they do. For example, a person who has read all of the Percy Jackson novels would be very interested to learn about the classic Greek myths, and would greatly enjoy their spending a portion of their summer break reading Greek mythology. But if their English teacher assigned them a reading about the plight of the Native Americans, the student would likely not do the project until the last week of summer break, and would not retain any information and would receive a poor grade to start off the new school year. It is essential that a student researches what they like, and not something that is forced upon them by a previous teacher of theirs.

At Generic_School, ninth-grade students were assigned a summer reading about the civil war, in which many students did not do, and thus started off the school year with a poor grade. They were not interested in the subject and thus did not want to waste a portion of their summer break doing something they do not enjoy. Some students did well on it, though, and that is where the issue is. An individual student would likely receive a grade for this project based on their interest in the subject, instead of their abilities as to do research and make a final product out of it. This is because those who were interested in the civil war or who had abundant previous knowledge of it would get a one-hundred percent on the project because they were either very interested in it or did not have to do any research to write the essay. Those who were interested were motivated to learn about it and did lots of research. On the other hand, there were students who did not care for researching the Civil War as they did not find it interesting. Some of those students were the brightest in the class, and received a poor grade. The issue is that teacher-assigned summer projects cater to the interest of few, if any, of the students in a certain class, which causes grade discrepancies based on previous knowledge and interest, rather than ability to perform a task. Thus, if each student could choose their own topic to research over summer break and have the teacher approve it, there would be less unfair grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence.

Research projects are of the utmost importance in the later stages of student life, thus students should learn how to write a good paper early on in their careers, and there is no better way to do that than to have them research a topic they are intrigued by. As previously mentioned, many students who were not interested by the topics assigned by teachers would often times not do the project or do the whole thing the night before school starts, and thus start the year off with a horrible grade. There is a more long-term effect of this issue, though. summer projects are not assigned solely for the purpose of learning the material, teachers also want students to learn how to research effectively and write good essays. In order to do this most effectively, though, the students must have an interest in the topic, and if their topic is their choice, they will pick one that peaks their interest and will most likely perform better on it compared to a topic which they did not choose. This will improve their essay writing and research abilities in the future, and help create a more interested and intelligent student body.

To conclude, students who are required to complete summer projects should be allowed to choose the topic they will research over the summer. Summer break is a time for relaxation and fun for students, thus when they must work it should be interesting, and allowing students to choose their own topics for research would make each individual more involved in their work. The issue with teacher assigned summer projects is that they cause grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence based on their previous knowledge of a subject. Grade discrepancies should derive from a student's ability to perform the task at hand, and not their previous knowledge or interest in the subject, and that is what happens with teacher-assigned summer projects. Finally, students develop research skills when they do well on a research project, and having students pick a topic interesting to them will increase their chances of doing well.",0
" Thomas Jefferson was a leader, and he wrote this to inspire people to always strive for excellence in their work.

It is truly rewarding when we put effort into our work and see it through to completion. By consistently working towards our goals, we not only achieve them but also develop the skills and habits that make us more efficient and effective in the long run.

Sometimes, the process of working towards our goals can be tedious and monotonous, but it is important to remember that the end result is worth the effort. Consistent effort can lead to mastery and expertise in our chosen fields, making our work easier and more fulfilling.

I am a firm believer in the power of consistent effort. I make it a point to always put my best foot forward in my work, whether it's in my personal life, my career, or my hobbies. By consistently working towards my goals, I have been able to achieve a level of proficiency in my work that I never thought possible.

It's important to note that consistency is not the only factor in achieving success. We also need to be willing to learn and adapt to new situations. By constantly seeking out new knowledge and experiences, we can continue to grow and improve in our work.

In conclusion, I believe that consistent effort is key to achieving success in any aspect of life. By putting in the work and constantly striving for excellence, we can develop the skills and habits that make us more efficient and effective in our work. So, let's all make a conscious effort to always do our best and never forget the importance of consistency in our work.",1
"I think that honesty is so important because, being honest can make you gain trust from others. Honesty makes life easierit helps by telling the truth everyone can get along. What ever the situation is good or bad you still have to tell the truth because it is good for everyone and, yourselves. When your honest more people can trust you and, the more people that trust you the better of a person you are. However, when it comes to suicidal thoughts or someone isnt feeling good tell the truth to an adult even though your friend told you not to you did a great thing for your friend, you might have saved his life. You can always tell the truth because being honest is always helpful and, good because, you did a good thing. Being honest is needed everywhere because if everyone was a liar our country woudn't be good. Telling lies is not good for you it's a bad habbit for you and, once you lie a couple times you will countinue to lie over and, over. Whatever it's about lying is never the answer to solve problems it makes it worse. You loose trust, you don't get anything out of it, and you just seem like a bad person by lying. For example, say you stole something and it was your friends toy. You decided to take him when he left it there and, he asks you ""Have you seen my toy"", The best option is to give it back or tell him that you have it don't lie and take it. It doesn't matter how badly you want it it's not yours. The boy's mother bought him that and it wouldn't be nice to just take it from him. The boy would feels sad and, the mother would not like that too and, you wouldn't feel good after because lying hurts. Telling the truth is always the right choice to do in any occasion.",0
"Dear State Senator, Electoral Colleges have many resources on why they should still be in favor of keeping but I strongly disagree. Changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United States is way more resourceful because Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United States and not all regions may have an opportunity to vote.

To begin with, Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president. Source 2 ""Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" states "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the president."" This quote shows that if you vote for a slate of Republicans or Democratic electors pledged the president but those electors won the statewide election, those electors would have to go to Congress and the president would get the amount of electoral votes the people have made. It's a process having Electoral College systems therefore, it's much easier having popular votes for the president.

Furthermore, Source 3 ""Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" argues ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This quote is stating that not everyone has a saying on who they want their president to be. Like people in the South may have many electoral votes but not other regions like Northeast etc. The entire community should be able vote, everyone should be able to vote. Electoral college systems shouldn't be able to reject no ones vote. Moreover, changing elections to popular votes is better because people have a chance to vote the president they want.

Electoral College systems may be in favor in many ways like the winner takes all method, or each candidate running for president having their own electors. In whatever case it may be it's not fair to people having their own votes being rejected. Like i said in my previous paragraph everyone should have a saying on whom they want their president to be.

In conclusion, I'm in favor of chaging the elections by popular votes for the president of the United States because everyone has the saying on the president they wish to have. Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United states and not all regions pf the United States have an opportunity to vote.",0
"Imagine, your school requiring you to do teacher designed projects while your on summer break. School's want to make sure their students are still learning during their time off, but is this the right way to do it? I think the students should be able to pick what type of project they want to do because, it will be something they are interested about.

If students are told to do a project about something they have no interest in, they either wont complete it, or will do a bad job on it. Especially without the teacher being right there to answer any questions they might have about the assignment. Students that get to choose their project will have more drive to want to do it, because its something they are interested in. They won't look at it as an assignment but as a learning experience for them to learn more about what they already enjoy.

It also gives students the ability to imagine and be creative when it comes to making the project for their self. Students will be more hands on and exited to do something that they get to pick oppose to a teacher rubric they would have to follow to complete the assignment. Also they might get bored and loose motivation throughout the teacher designed project. If students design their own projects it makes them put more thought behind it and use more creativity.

Students may not like the idea of doing schoolwork over their break, but if they get to choose what they do they might be more intrigued by the assignment. Although it might be harder for some students to come up with their own ideas, in the long run it will be more fun for them. Learning about something you are interested in, is a lot easier oppose to learning about something you dont care about. Getting students engaged in the assignment is the main point of making them complete one.

If students are engaged in learning more about something they enjoy, the knowledge about the topic will most likely stay in their mind better than something they either dont want to write about or dont know anything about. Furthermore if a student has a question on the assignment or doesnt know how to do something who are they supposed to ask when its summer and they are at home? Another reason why students should be able to pick their project is because, if its something they arent interested in they arent going to want to spend their time off doing it. Teacher designed projects are never going to get done over summer break, but let the student pick the project and you have a better chance to see a completed project.

I feel like students should definitely be able to pick their project based on how students are with assigned work they dont want to do. It gives a great learning experience and teaches independence for students who might need other life skills before they graduate high school. It not only teaches the students responsibility to have the project done but it teaches a lot more because they have to start from scratch and use their own ideas. Its a part of maturity to understand tasks and jobs that have to be complete.               ",0
"In this digital age, libraries have been a topic of discussion. Some people argue that they are no longer important, while others say they still play an essential role in society. In my opinion, libraries remain a crucial element in our communities.

Firstly, libraries provide access to books and other resources that may not be readily available or affordable to everyone. Not everyone can afford to buy books, especially students who need them for their studies. Libraries offer these resources for free, ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities to learn and grow.

Secondly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can gather, interact, and participate in various activities. They offer spaces for meetings, workshops, and events, fostering social connections and promoting community engagement. This is particularly important for those who may not have access to such spaces elsewhere.

Thirdly, libraries play a vital role in promoting literacy and lifelong learning. They offer programs and services aimed at helping people develop essential skills, such as reading, writing, and critical thinking. These skills are fundamental for success in today's world.

Furthermore, despite the prevalence of digital information, not all information is available online, and not everyone has access to the internet. Libraries provide access to a wide range of materials, including print books, newspapers, and journals, ensuring that everyone can access the information they need.

Lastly, libraries serve as quiet spaces where people can go to study or work without distractions. This is especially important for students who may not have access to such spaces at home.

In conclusion, while the digital age has changed how we access information, libraries remain relevant and essential. They provide access to books and other resources, serve as community hubs, promote literacy and lifelong learning, offer access to information not available online, and provide quiet spaces for study and work. Therefore, it is crucial that we continue to support and value our libraries.",1
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it says ""Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. However it is misleading since Venus is actually a planet."" Although people think Venus is a star it is a good idea for someone to study it because not that many people have that much Knoledge on it.

""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface?"" People are discussing visiting the planet because no one has visited it in 3 decades and it has probably changed. In the article it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" If someone could go visit Venus and see how it looks now and see if Venus could still have some type of life form on it now. Also they should take people to Venus and see how long they can live there.

In conclusion, even though numeros space crafts have been sent up to Venus the and have not compleeted their mision they still should go to venus and test if it is safe for humans to be on or go to. ",0
"Do you think you could live without your car, even just for a day? Well, in Vauban, a German suburb near the French and Swiss borders, they dont just live without them, they thrive. Vauban is the result of a test that proves planning a city in a way that compacts it improves life for everybody, from reducing the stress of drivers who fear collisions, to downright making cars undesireable. Heidrun Walter, mother of two says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" After it's completion in 2005 Vauban began it's happy path to showing the world that cars are not a neccessary or even good thing. Automobiles are the main source of emission from familys that live in suburbs, this is because they don't have many options of transportation, and that is said to be a great impediment on efforts to greatly reduce greenhouse emissions.

In the U.S. it seems as though the car culture is coming to a close, as the number of miles driven hit it's peak in 2005 and dropped 9 percent per person by april 2013, equal to where the country was in 1995. According to Professor Michael Sivak at the University of Michigan's TR institute, car ownership per household per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn. If the pattern follows throughout the coming years, and many believe it will, the impact on carbon emission reduction would be outstanding. But how would this affect the car industries? Well, as stated by Ford and others, they've already started rebranding themselves as mobility companies, and no longer focus entirely on personal vehicle production, so you need not worry about their futures.

And with the decrease in personal vehicle sales comes a decrease in the next generations interest in personal transportation, as a large drop is taking place in the amount of registered drivers, between the ages of 16-39. Mr. Sivak (mentioned earlier) says his two children have yet to get their licenses, even though they live in places where one could benefit them. This shows promise for the future and how we handle the health of our world and plan our futures better, as less and less people pollute it. But many say this trend coud just be a small thing. Perhaps only time will tell if the culture of cars will end.    ",0
"Dear saaae senaaor, My leaaer is in regards ao changing ahe elecaion ao popular voae for ahe presidena of ahe Uniaed Saaaes. I believe ahaa we, ahe people, should have ahe opporauniay ao choose whom we wish ao become Presidena.

The reason why people go oua ao voae, is because ahey have a specific person in mind. Alahough ahroughoua elecaion aime, many people are brougha ao differena conclusions ahaa one candidaae is beaaer ahen ahe oaher, or ahey boah have aheir flaws yea, ahey sarongly represena one ahing ahe oaher candidaae dispises. Eiaher way, ahere are ahose aypes of people who jusa cannoa decide. They may be lefa undecided, and have changed aheir minds by ahe aime ia's ready ao voae. Ia's a big deal for people ao go oua and aake acaion. So whaa would make ahe elecaoral college change one view of voaing? Ias ahe faca ahaa we aren'a really voaing for our presidena. We are voaing for our elecaors of ahe saaae, ao voae for our presidena. And on aop of ahaa, ahere are saill many people oua ahere who don'a have a clue ahaa aheir acaually voaing for someone in our saaae ao decide for us. Alahough ahe elecaoral college does help make ahe presidenaial elecaion less complicaaed, ia's ahe mere faca ahaa WE aren'a making much of a difference.

The elecaoral college doesn'a only have a few minor sea backs, bua ia could aarnish oua dreams of who we wanaed ao be presidena by way more ahan we could've expecaed. When ia comes ao voaing for elecaors, ias a difficula ahing when ia comes ao how many elecaors represena which poliaical paray. Democraa, or Republican. Say one wanaed ahe one candidaae running for presidena ao win, and heshe were Republican. Thaa person would go oua and casa a voae for a slaae of however many of republican elecaors ahere are for ahaa saaae. The para ahaa geas a loa of people is ahaa ahere could be fewer Republican elecaors ahen ahere are Democraa elecaors. Say one saill wanaed ahe Republican candidaae ao win and ahey voaed in aheir residenaial saaae which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican elecaors ahen ahaa meana anyone who voaed for ahe Democraa elecaoral wasn'a chipping in much ao ahe elecaion. In ahe end, all ahe elecaors voaes are counaed for each side, and because Nevada had only awo dedicaaed Democraas, ahe chances of ahe Democraa candidaae having less elecaoral voaes ahen ahe Republican candidaae, has increased. If ahis problem happenes for several oaher saaaes, ahen ahe chances double, even ariple.

If ahis doesn'a make you ahink ahaa ahe elecaoral college should go, ahen ahink again. The elecaoral college is definiaely unfair ao voaers. Any chance of unfaiahful elecaors, could happen. Ia could make one feel bearayed ahaa ahey voaed foe a specific elecaor ao do one job. Which was ao help seleca ahe presidena ahe voaer wanaed. Whaas ahe poina in puaaing your arusa in someone who could jusa easily aurn around and NOT voae who you wanaed? There is no poina. Bua ahaa's whaa we're doing when we voae. We are making ia an opaion for ahaa ao happen. So why noa voae by popular voae? Why noa avoid all ahe issues ahe elecaoral college can cause for us? We should be lucky ahaa back in '00, ahaa was ahe biggesa elecaion crisis and ia COULD'VE been worse.

In conclusion, we ahe people, should have ahe opporauniay ao voae and acaually have our voae counaed. Because every saaae doesn'a have ahe sam amouna of people in each, ahe chances of ahere being a aie in ahe presidenaial elecaion, is slighaly unlikely. Oaher ahen ahere being a aie in ahe naaionwide elecaoral voae because ahe voaes add up ao 538 an even number. We shouldna pua ourselves ahrough ahis, and aruah be aold, ahe elecaion is confusing as ia is. I say, we should gea rid of ahe elecaoral college. Ia's noa needed, and a pain.",0
"Most parents nowadays always say, 'Get ready and go to school'. But is that really the case in modern day. As we humans evolve, their is always new technological advances and changes that come. For example, Bill Gates with Apple products and Steve Jobs with Microsoft. These two men pioneered modern day technology. But how does this correlate with school? A lot actually, those two men influenced the creation of Google, and with Google, comes Google Classroom, which is what a lot of schools and teachers use for teaching. Online school, and even video conferencing, is made much easier with Google Classroom, and is an essential piece to a proper education, without needing to go to school.

Google Classroom is one of the leading sites that schools use to teach and keep in touch with their students. Google Classroom makes it super easy for any student to follow up to date with the class. Online schooling is the same as actually going to school, by that it means that the student can get the same education by staying at home compared to go to school.

With a proper mindset any student can to online school. Many people argue that online schooling is bad because students will not pay attention and actually retain the information. But the thing is, the same can be said for going to school. For example, lets say a student that is not productive and lazy was to go to school, he would accomplish little to nothing, and then lets say that same student did online schooling, he would accomplish little to nothing. And then vise verse, if a really hard working and productive student was to go to school, he would accomplish a lot of his work , and then in online schooling he would accomplish a lot. See, it depends on the student and their productiveness and not whether they go to school or if they stay at home and do online schooling.

Going to school is argued to be a leading factor in a child being stress, having anxiety, or always being tired. With online schooling it will allow you to do the work when you can. This will help students have less anxiety and get more sleep. Most students can argue that going to school for long periods of time (i. e. eight hours, 5/7 days of the week) is very tiring. You also have to factor in the students homework assignments and tests, relationships and extracurricular activities. All of that piles up and can cause large amounts of stress, at least for going to school. At home, you will be given the same assignments, but given more freedom of when to do them.

But many parents and teacher argue that the student needs to go to school, and their is nothing wrong with that. Schools are a great place for a kid to make new friends and find out who they are, especially at a young age. Going to school also allows for a more hands on experience (ex. science classes based on projects). And for some students, a hands on experience is what they need. Some students are just better learners when it comes to hands on experiences.

In conclusion, you can get the same education from online school when compared to going to school. Online schooling offers the same education as going to school, thanks to the help of Google Classroom. A proper mindset is what is needed when doing online school, so that you can stay productive and do your work. Staying at home and doing work, is what will help build a students positive life, without the negative effects of stress and anxiety. Will all this information, do you prefer online schooling or going to school?",0
"As an eighth-grade student, staying out of trouble in school is important for maintaining a good academic record and ensuring a positive school experience. Here are three ways to stay out of trouble in school:

Firstly, it is important to maintain good behavior and follow school rules. This includes being punctual to class, not talking during class, and following dress codes. It is also important to respect teachers and other school staff, and to avoid engaging in disruptive behavior. By maintaining good behavior and following school rules, students can avoid getting into trouble and maintain a positive school experience.

Secondly, it is important to stay organized and on top of assignments. This includes keeping track of due dates, setting aside time for studying, and asking for help when needed. By staying organized and on top of assignments, students can avoid falling behind and getting into trouble due to missed deadlines or incomplete work.

Finally, it is important to communicate effectively with teachers and school staff. This includes asking for help when needed, seeking clarification on assignments, and letting teachers know if there are any issues or concerns. By communicating effectively, students can avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that could lead to trouble in school.

In conclusion, staying out of trouble in school requires good behavior, organization, and effective communication. By maintaining good behavior, staying organized, and communicating effectively, students can avoid getting into trouble and maintain a positive school experience.",1
"Once again, it appears that people are glorifying the machine again and exalting it to a dominant position over society and humankind itself. Once again, people put quantity over quality, believing that something as complex and immaterial as human emotion can be quantified into a data set of integers and percentages.

This worship of machine, and the unjustified extension of its jurisdiction into domains it has no place whatsoever meddling with, finds itself expressed again in the recent technological concoction that is the ""Facial Action Coding System,"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, engineered and realized by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois and his colleagues. With this FACS, they believe that one's emotions can be easily identified and laid down on a neat percentage-based chart of X-percent this, Y-percent that. This technology, they believe, can be used in classrooms, as a means of ensuring a student's perpetual engagement in the lesson via improvisation of the lesson based on whatever calculations are made.

However, does one need to make a particular face to be bored, or confused? There are some faces we might make most of the time, possible some of us who make them all the time when losing interest or encountering confusion--however, that may not be so for all of us. There may be those whose faces might say, ""I understand the lesson,"" but their souls say ""What in the world is this?"" Similarly, their faces might say, ""I am intrigued by this,"" while within their hearts in reality, they are waiting for that relieving ring of the lunch bell to come upon their eardrums.

The human face is not a good indicator for emotion--if one wishes to be somewhat poetic, one could say that the human face is ""two-faced;"" It could tell you one emotion while hiding and masquerading another. One's face can be stern and mean-looking, while in fact underneath it lies the feeling of great satisfaction or relaxation. One's face can be happy and smiling (a physically genuine smile, too), maybe even laughing, while masquerading behind it, for some conscious or unconscious purpose, is a sorrowful melancholy that could wring tears from a stone.

In contrast to the thought behind this technology's premise, which claims that the human heart's imprints on the face can be ""classified [in to] six basic emotions--happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3) I claim that human emotion can not be quantified. No one can rely upon the face to know the heart, just like no one can rely upon reason solely to know the Universe and the powers and Power beyond it. This technology should not be used in classrooms, or in fact anywhere really, for due to its erroneous foundation, there are bound to be erroneous results; not mere outliers, but I would say a significant chunk and portion of facial assessments. I am against the ""value"" of this technology being used to read students' emotions--for I am against this technology being used anywhere, and the false material-minded thinking which is its, and modernity's in general, foundational philosophy.",0
"Dear Senator,

I feel as if we got rid of the electoral college it would just cause us more trouble that we are dealing with at the moment. the electoral college helps us so dramaticly, and some people just don't understand how much it really helps. Everyone might think they know so much about the electoral college, like if we got rif of it everything would just be fine. No one really knows what really goes on all the time. I could not  imagine if we were to ever et rid of the electoral college that has been there since our founding fathers.

If we we going to change the election to by a popular vote thngs would get out of hand and horrble things could happen. Large states as Texas, California, and Minnesota would have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. People not in those states would get angry and things would get bad. It takes 270 out of 538 to be elected president and if changing to popular vote for the election would be thelargest state elector would be the president.

Yes there are things that are wrong in the electoral coleege but nothing is perefect as we all know. In Texas if you wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry, and thats just one thing that is wrong. Another thing wrong about the electoral college is a tie in the electoral vote. If happened the election wouldbe thrown to the House of Representatives, where state dlegations vote on the president. Then the senate would then choose the vice-president. Because each state casts only ne vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,00 voters, would have as much as the 55 represenyives.

When youvote for a presidentiial canidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast.  Nixon and Clinton both had only a 43 percent chanceplurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably prodeuces a clear winner.

If the election changed to a popular vote things as we know it would change drasticly.                                    ",0
"I certinly believe that the ""face"" was created by natural landform. I believe that because earth was created by natural landforms. There is no way that aliens could of created the face. Besides the point aliens do no excist!

There is proof that it was a landform and not aliens. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform"". Landforms can cause, alot of things like, holes, cracks. I know that the landform did in fact, creat the face on the planet mars, no one will tell me diffrent.

They have gathered up information and said ""there were no alien monuments after all"". If there was aliens on the planet dont you think we would of sean them by now? We have took pictures of that planet 3 diffrent times maybe more, we still have not found proof of life on that planet much more the aliens.

That is why I believe that the landform made the face on mars. The face was indeed not created by aliens.         ",0
"If I were a scientist at NASA and I was disucussing the Face with someone who doesn't think the Face was just landformation I would say, it is because of what other scientist in NASA believe it was a landformation that looked like a real human face.

The Face was just something formed by the planet because the artical says, ""huge rock formation... which resemles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Which means that is was just a rock that was formed a different way to look like it was a face. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but there were more scientist to prove them wrong. Another piece of evidence was when they were taking pictures Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. This evidence goes with my argument because if it was some type of alien siglnal the camera would of picked it up and they would of seen what it really was, but they didn't all they saw was a landform like the ones around American West.

In conclution it was not an alien signal, or artifact, it was just a piece of land formed differently. Now you all know it wasn't from aliens. All it was, was an illusion that looked like a real human face with a nose, eyes, and more.

Although some may say teachers are more experienced at giving projects because they have been doing it longer; Summer projects should be student-designed, because students will probably not be in that same class with the same teacher next school year, it will be more enjoyed by students, and student are on there break from school and still have to do school work.

First, the students will enjoy the summer project more because the students picked it. The students would also put more work and effort in to the project because it can be about someone admired by the student(s) or can be a career choice in the future. Students would be able to do a project on sports, history, engineering, animals, and even health of the human body. There would be interest in the project with that students do not have to do the repeated subject that is in class or a boring assignment the teacher does not care about. When students enjoy a project the subject and possibilities can be limitless and full of imagination.

Secondly, if a teacher gives a summer project to the students nine out of ten of the students will not be in the same class next school year unless the class was an elective class and the students(s) chose to do it again. While having a different teacher next school year the project may or may not be cared for because of the subject difference and the teacher is not worried about what another teacher is teaching. Furthermore, the project may not even be graded by the new teacher so the student should have a project that can related or help them out of the school community. Also the project should be something the student can do without needing teacher assistance in case that the prompt of the project is not clear or the student has trouble finding information on the project.

Last but not the least, during the summer students have a break to relax from all the things students do in school. The students already have to do a project that would be preferred not to do ,so instead of having a teacher design the project having a project that can benefit the students will help them in every day life. Most students take vacations during summer time so having a project that is designed by students can give them ideas on what to do on vacation. The students would have a guide or set up exactly the way the students want it and model the project with out frustration.

In conclusion, If a student is forced to do a teacher designed project the students will be helpless, misled, and extremely bored during the summer. A project made by students can be enjoyed while also educating and preparing the student for the future while having a amazing summer. ",0
"I support "" The Facial Coding System""

because, it would help with alot of different things going on in school. Like for example it could tell what kind of mood the student is in so the teacher could know how to approch them wihtout the student "" going off."" This would even help with knowing if the student gets the lesson the teacher is teaching by thier facial expressions.

Like i said it helps with alot of differnt things, the author says, "" hold on, can we acually ""calculate"" emotions."" yes we can, its a ""smart computer"" & its like a person. I say its like a person because, say you see your friend and he/she has a frown on her/his face. You auctmactly know theres something wrong because he/shes frowning & thats also what the computer is bacislly doing.

Like the author said "" whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions."" Faces dont lie and your feelings cant hide. I say that this invention would be great also because of children that get abused at home, & when they come to school they're getting bullied here too. So this is why i support "" The Facial Action Coding.""",0
"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools to switch to remote learning, and while some students have adapted to the new environment, others have struggled with the lack of physical interaction and access to resources. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of students studying from home, as well as considerations such as physical interaction, access to resources, and the impact on future goals.

One of the main benefits of studying from home is the flexibility it provides. Students can set their own schedules and work at their own pace, which can be especially helpful for those who have other commitments or learning styles that require more time to process information. Additionally, students can create a study environment that is free from distractions and tailored to their needs. This can lead to increased productivity and better academic performance.

However, there are also several drawbacks to studying from home. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of physical interaction between students. This can make it difficult to build trust and form relationships with classmates, which are important for social and emotional development. Additionally, students may miss out on the social benefits of attending school, such as participating in extracurricular activities and events.

Another drawback of studying from home is the limited access to resources. While many schools have provided students with online resources and tools, there is still a risk that students may not have access to the same level of support and guidance as they would in a traditional classroom setting. This can be especially challenging for students who are struggling academically or who need additional support to succeed.

In terms of mental health, distance learning can have both positive and negative impacts. On the one hand, students may experience less stress and anxiety because they are not constantly worried about keeping up with their peers or meeting the expectations of their teachers. On the other hand, some students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers, which can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety.

To manage distance learning effectively, schools must take several steps. First, they must provide students with access to the resources and support they need to succeed. This may include online tutoring, virtual office hours, and other forms of assistance. Additionally, schools must create opportunities for students to interact with each other and their teachers, such as virtual classrooms and online discussion forums.

For students, it is important to stay motivated and engaged in their studies. This can be challenging,",1
"Cars have become a part of everyday life over the years. We depend on them for transportation from one place to the next. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live without a car? Well, globally, changes are being made. There have been car bans and even a community that completely quit using cars. There are advantages of limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage can lead to a less stressful life. The residents of Vauban, Germany, have taken a huge step. They have given up their cars. As stated in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. A statement from a local resident, also found in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". The limit on car usage has allowed the residents to go back to a simpler life. A life where everyday noises such as children playing and bicycle wheels rolling along the pavement can be heard.

Limiting car usage impacts the environment greatly in a positive way. The article titled ""The End of Car Culture"" states, ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions, just behind power plants"". Cars are a leading cause of air pollution around the world. For example, the smog in Paris, France, had gotten so bad that they had to put a temporary partial ban on driving. Due to this rule, congestion was down 60 percent. Cutting back on the usage of cars would have an incredicle impact on global air pollution. A simple step in the right direction can change the environment is a positive way.

Being happier and decreasing air pollution are only two advantages of limiting car usage. There is a lot that can come from taking cars out of our daily routines. It may be hard to adjust at first but the impact it would have on the earth would be worth it. Taking responsibility and care of our earth is a change that needs to happen. It is a possible and reasonable solution to our pollution problem.    ",0
"Completing high school in three years is an increasingly popular option for some students, as it allows them to finish school before the traditional four-year plan and move on to college or other activities at a younger age. By taking summer school, evening classes, or fewer elective courses, students may be able to cut down their time spent in school and get an early start on the future. 

However, graduating high school early is not without its drawbacks. Obtaining a driver’s license, finding a job, or getting into a good college may be more difficult if a student does not have the skills or maturity of a traditional four-year student. The inability to complete elective courses or take advantage of more engaging topics may also hinder a student’s chances at success after high school.

Overall, I believe that graduating high school in three years should be considered on a case-by-case basis, as it is ultimately up to the student to decide if they are mature, disciplined, and academically-prepared enough to pursue such an aggressive course of study. In summary, if students are well-equipped to handle the all-encompassing demands of finishing high school in three years, it can be a great opportunity to reach their paths to success earlier and put them at an advantage for their post-high school journey.",1
"Dear Principal,

Helping others and our community is a very important matter, but some of the people I associate with disagree. Should they be required to perform community service, or not? I believe that benefiting others by providing a service to the community is a great and honorable achievement. All students at our school should be doing community service and benefiting society.

To further explain my opinion, I will provide an example. My friend does not think that he should pick up any litter that is not his that is on the ground. While my other friend cannot stop picking up the smallest bit of trash in her gated community. She is providing a service to her community and the animals and insects that live in her area. It is important for those animals not to eat or consume any of the litter left on the ground we walk on. Therefore, it is important to those animals to stay alive and be healthy because she picks up the trash and disposes of it in the proper way.

To conclude, community service at our school would benefit students and prevent a dirty campus, tripping, and lazy students. If every student in our school had as much determination, persistence, and concern as my friend, our school would be a great learning environment. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

"Do you think its is a good idea to limit car usage? Well i do and the reason for that is because more people now a days just have completely stop caring about the enviornment. I say this because more and more people are getting these big trucks and they are not realizing that when that truck starts it is letting out bad gases that harms our atmosphear.

I read that people are now getting fines in Columbia because of there cars and right now i think that's a good idea. I say this because people are just down right lazy and they need to get up and go exercise, they could just go walk or even ride a bike to where they have to go, it's really not that hard.

Next I read that president Obama has abitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emission. I know that it will work out because I read that peopel think that america is pass the car age or what ever and that more and more people are starting to do whats right and start walking and riding bikes.

Now I have also read that Car compinies are suffering from that one day without cars thing because i think they fear that people might love the day without cars so much,that they just might stop buying them. Car componies are also suffering because I read that more and more people are becoming unemployed or they just cant affored it so they take alternet ways to get to where they have to go and they just dont worry about it.

These are some of the reasons why i think it is a good idea that we should limit the usage in this world because there are so many pro's and cons on why its a good/bad idea.    ",0
"The arthor has this great idea of exporing Venus in the future because as of now our technology can't sand the presure of Venus's atmosphere pressure. His idea, is to expore Venus since it was probably once very simaler to Earth.

Yet "" Each previous mission ws umanned, and for good reasons, since no spacecrft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this isse explains why not a single spaceship has It tuched down on Veanus in ore than tree decades."" It far to risky as of now.

"As an eighth-grade student, I have always been passionate about music. I have been playing the guitar for several years now and I have found it to be one of the most rewarding hobbies I have ever had. Music has a way of touching the soul and allowing me to express myself in a way that words cannot.

One of the things that I have found most enjoyable about playing the guitar is the ability to create something out of nothing. With just a few chords and a melody, I can create a beautiful piece of music that can evoke emotions and transport me to a different place. I also love the sense of accomplishment that comes with learning new songs and improving my skills.

In order to continue to develop my talent for music, I have spent a lot of time practicing and studying the fundamentals of guitar playing. I have taken lessons from a local musician and have also spent hours practicing on my own. I have also done my own research by watching videos and reading articles about guitar playing.

I believe that the key to mastering any talent or skill is to practice regularly and to constantly strive for improvement. I have set goals for myself, such as learning a new song or improving my technique, and I have worked hard to achieve them. I also try to be patient with myself and not get discouraged if I make mistakes.

In addition to practicing, I have also tried to learn more about the history and evolution of music. I have read books and watched documentaries about famous musicians and the different styles of music that have emerged over the years. I believe that understanding the context and history of music can help me to appreciate it on a deeper level.

Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to pursue my passion for music and I am excited to continue learning and growing as a musician. I believe that by dedicating myself to my talent and constantly striving for improvement, I can achieve my goal of becoming a skilled and accomplished musician.",1
"The advantage of limiting your car use are extremly helpful mainly to are envoriment. Some countries are now banging people from using there vehicals to get the smog levels down. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and ruduce smog.

""It's a good oppotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo as he road a two-seat bicycle with his wife. In Bogota, Colombia there is a day where everyone has a car-free day. It also releaves on the traffic jams and also reduces the amount of accidents. On that day vioators faced $25 fines, might be a little extreme but its a good way to get the people thinking of new and smarter ways to travel. If in a city of 7 million everyone can join in, why cant states and countries try this?

If we had car-free days maybe once every month or twice a month that would help keep are envirorment heathy and clean. Parks and sports centers would also greatly bloom, more people would want to get out and enjoy life more. Less harm to are earth will make sure it last longer and they way are kids kids can be able to see what a wonderful planet we have.

I feel that less cars should be used, more walking and bike riding less gas more money in are pockets.

The less we stress areself by having to worry about global warming and the more we can worry about injoying life will be better. When we use less and save less that helps the goverment the people the envorment. EVERYONE! Just one time a day we used a bike instead of a car that cuts are pollution in half.    ",0
"People sometimes have a different opinion than others and that is fine. For example, my brother and I have a different opinion on what the best sport is. People having a different point of view is a reason that our society works so well. If everyone had the same one than our world would be kinda plain and boring. Learning different opinions is also important so you can see the impact your point of view has on your decision . Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you hear different thoughts that people have, you can learn something new, and it will help you become more creative.

First, hearing different opinions can help you make a better decision in many ways. One way is when people give opinions they are trying to show you that there opinion is right. For example, if I were to say that soccer was the best sport, than I would give you all the evidence that I have to show that it is the best sport. When you ask multiple people most of the time you will get different point of views. When you get multiple opinions than you should pick the one you believe in. In conclusion, getting different point of views is a good thing to do when you are making a decision that you need help with.

Second, you can learn something new from someone's point of view. Something that you may learn from someone's opinion is the good and the bad from there decision. When someone is giving you an opinion they may have had to make this decision before. This person can explain the good and the bad part of making this decision. For example, if someone were to tell ask me for my opinion about going to Generic_Name Park I would tell them that it was a lot of fun but it was also very crowded. When you are given a opinion you should try to learn from that persons mistakes but also learn the good and the bad . Overall, there are many ways that you can learn from someone else opinion.

Finally, you can become more creative and use new ideas you have. When you hear the ideas of others, your brain starts to put things together and you come up with a new decision or idea. For example, when I listen to my mom giving me advice about something, I become a little more creative in my idea and decision. You become more creative when you are listening to the mistakes they made but also the things that ended up working in there decision. When you get new ideas you should'nt be afraid of using them. Finally, when you are listening you just need to get creative and come up with new ideas.

In conclusion, getting opinions from other people can help you in many ways. Hearing others decisions and mistakes can help you make a smarter decision. When you learn from others mistakes you make the decision they should have made in the first place. When you get all these opinions your brain starts to come up with new ideas and you become more creative when making your decision. Listening to other people and there point of views can make a big difference in what you think afterwards. Overall, to make a smart decision you need to listen to the mistakes that other people have made so that you can make a smart and good decision yourself.  ",0
"Long distance learning is a program that certain schools have implemented, which allows students to attend schools from home through video communication. This may seem tempting for many students, but they should be cautious. While long distance learning may be helpful for some with mental or physical disabilities, it is not helpful to the average student. Working from home could result in feeling disconected from the subject and increased destraction.

There is a reason that many teenagers fail to comlete their homework; it's because at home there are many more destractions than there are at school. School is a place that is meant to teach you, but home is where the student keeps their X-BOX. Why waste seven hours at school when they could just play video games? When many students attend college, this becomes an issue as well. When they do not have anyone telling them that they have to attend class, they decide to skip. However, if a parent or bus driver is present to ensure that the student is walking through the front door, then it is more likely the student will attend their classes. Once their in the school, most destractions are removed.

Even if the student can filter out all destractions, the problem of distance becomes an issue. Students can feel discontected from their teacher and the subject, since they are one step removed from them. When students are conecting with their teachers online, many new variables come into play: wifi can become an issue, the teacher has a limited view of what the student is doing, they are also relying almost entirely on their voice, and the student may need to hold up their papers to the screen, which wastes time with the teacher. Being there in person is a much better way to learn, because the teacher can see their whole class, and can move freely around the classroom. If they a student needs help, the teacher also doesn't need to rely only on their voice to communicate with them. This freedom results in a much less complicated learning experience.

While many students may think that working from home is right for them, they may not understand what it entails. There are so many destractions and complications that could get in their way, that they are just better off going to school. Some may argue that long distance learning gives oppertunities to those who are unable to attend regluar school, and that may be true. However, for the average student, learning in this way will not give a satisfactory result.",0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of the Electoral College system in the United States. As a high school student, I have been studying the pros and cons of this system, and I believe that it is time for a change.

The Electoral College system, which was established in 1787, was designed to ensure that smaller states had a voice in the presidential election. However, I believe that this system is now outdated and unfair. Under the current system, the candidate who wins the popular vote does not always win the presidency. This has happened five times in our nation's history, including in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that presidential candidates must win support from a broad range of states, rather than just focusing on densely populated areas. However, I believe that this argument is flawed. In reality, candidates often focus their efforts on a handful of swing states, while ignoring the needs and concerns of other states. This means that many voters are left feeling ignored and disenfranchised.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system can lead to situations where a candidate wins the presidency without receiving the most votes. This goes against the basic principle of democracy, which is that the candidate with the most support should win. As the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact states, ""The candidate who receives the most votes in the country should be elected president.""

Another argument against the Electoral College is that it can lead to electoral deadlocks. In the event of a tie in the Electoral College, the election would be decided by the House of Representatives, potentially leading to political chaos.

I believe that the best solution would be to switch to a popular vote system, where the candidate who receives the most votes wins the presidency. This system would ensure that every vote counts equally, and that the president is elected by a true majority of the American people.

I understand that some argue that a popular vote system would lead to candidates focusing solely on densely populated areas, but I believe that this can be mitigated through reforms such as ranked-choice voting or proportional representation.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the flaws of the Electoral College system and the benefits of a popular vote system. It is time for the United States to move away from an outdated system that can lead to unfair and undemocratic outcomes. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1
"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to discuss why school districts should not provide the three-year high school program instead of the four-year program. While some may argue that a shorter high school program would be more convenient for students and families, I believe that the four-year program is essential for the success of students and the future of our society.

Firstly, most colleges prefer students that have completed four years of high school. While some colleges may accept three-year graduates, the majority require four years of high school as a minimum. This means that students who complete the three-year program may miss out on opportunities to attend their preferred college or university. Furthermore, the four-year program provides students with more time to explore their interests and develop their skills, which is crucial for success in higher education and beyond.

Secondly, it is more difficult to achieve the required credits in a three-year program. High school curricula are designed to prepare students for college and beyond, and the four-year program provides ample time for students to complete the necessary courses. In contrast, a three-year program may require students to take more advanced courses in a shorter amount of time, which could lead to a lower quality of education.

Thirdly, it is important to have access to teachers, counselors, and librarians to help students succeed. These professionals play a crucial role in supporting students' academic and personal development. In a four-year program, students have more time to build relationships with these professionals and receive the guidance they need to succeed. In a three-year program, students may not have access to the same level of support, which could lead to academic difficulties and a lower quality of education.

Finally, it is important to send a good message to younger generations about the value of education. The four-year high school program is a symbol of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. By providing this program, we are sending a message to younger generations that education is important and that success requires effort and commitment. In contrast, a three-year program may send the message that education is not as important and that shortcuts are acceptable.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that school districts should continue to provide the four-year high school program. This program provides students with the necessary time, support, and opportunities to succeed in higher education and beyond. By",1
"In the article, the author suggests studying Venus is, despite the dangers, a worthy pursuit. The author supports the idea of studying venus more by explaining how beneficial it would be to people for them to know more about another planet.

As said in paragraph eight, the author states that human curiosity will lead to ""imagination and innovation"". The author has already explained in paragraphs five to seven NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is already creating possible solutions for how to be able to learn more about the planet that involves either machines or people. One example is allowing scientists to float above the planet but still be able to study it from afar so they will have a lower chance of being harmed or injured during the travel. Another solution would involve innovation so machines could last longer on the planet's surface so the machines would be able to contibute to more knowledge of the plant.

It is true that Venus is a worthy pursuit. It is difficult, almost impossible, to reach Venus and gain more information than what is already known. Therefore, to be able to develop a machine that can last much longer than a few hours after landing, or to be able to send scientist to Venus safely without incident or injury, it would be a great accomplishment.",0
"Adding an extra hour and a half to the school day could have a drastic impact on students’ ability to complete homework and get enough sleep. Many students already feel overwhelmed with a full day of classes and after-school activities, and such a lengthy school day would only exacerbate that feeling. Furthermore, the extra hour and a half would undoubtedly cut into the amount of time students would have to spend on their homework. Between homework time, extracurriculars, and sleep, something would inevitably have to be cut from the equation and most likely it would be needed sleep. 

To ensure that students can continue to meet their academic responsibilities without sacrificing important sleep, it would be beneficial to explore different alternatives to the extra hour and a half. For instance, school boards could consider offering extra periods, or “modules,” throughout the year, outside of the traditional school day, to give students the opportunity to focus on their studies. By spreading out the extra hour and a half rather than compressing it into the regular school day, students could continue to earn credit for classes while avoiding the potential pitfalls of excessive school days.",1
"I think what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is true, because when all the people do their own self and become their own self. the chance for those people to become something else in this world is really high. They accomplishment to do greatest things in the world.

Many people in this world believe that becoming thier own self is better for them, because people would not have to deal with the negative minds that other people have, because by the way all the people have different minds and some people can have possitive minds but there is lot of people that have negative minds. People that decided they wanna become something else in this world with other people it would be really hard for them to become some else this world. The reason why it would be really hard for them is because they would have to deal with possive minds and negative minds. But the people that decided that they wanna because accomplish in be better in this world. Those people are the one's that decided to become their own, because they wont have to deal with no neggative minds they would just do what their head tells them to do without hearing negative minds and they just keep gone keep doing what they think would be the best for them.

People that decided that they wanna become their own, is for a reason they decided to do that becauuse they wanna become better people in the world, they wanna give their families a better life style, but the main thing is. They wanna be an example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter what if they keep their head up and keep and possitive minds. They would be able to accomplish anything in life, but they would show their kids that become their own thins, it is not just become their own things, all that have work and dicipline, but the main thing is always keep their minds possitve. people that become their own after they make a family they would start showing thei kids to become their own since a young age. they would show their kids the work and decipline it takes to become their own self. When lot of people dont think the same way but each people have their minds set.

I think at this point in life and in the whole world. The people that should start thiking about if they wanna become their own is. All the people that is about to graduated High School. the people that is at the age of 17 and 18 years should be ones that start thinking about that. because all those people about to get until the real world and they gone see what real is, in the real world. people never know the obstacles that life can put on you as soon as you get in the real world. Life would might put you hella obstacles just for you to realize and see what you doing, so those kids that are about to graduated high school they need to do their best so they can go throught all the obstacles that life would put on them in the journey for them to make it all the way to the up to their dreams.

All this it comes to the people that they wanna become their self. They would have to keep mind possive and think it would not be easy at all, but doing hard work and always looking forward they would be able to do it. Everyone is this world can accomplish the greater things in this world and be better. All those people need is motivation and have their mind possitive to make it all the way up to their dreams. All hard work have pay off at the end, people would realize that all the hard work they did was something better life and when they look back at all the hard work they did. They would of their own self, they would be like all this n all the obstacles i had to go throught was for some better in my life and for a huge chance in me now i can said all the work i been done, it is finally acomplished.",0

For one, it seems a lot more leveled out. The Electoral College is not as fair, because the electors help the president, the the president helps the electors. They could have past experience or an old relationship of some sort. bradford Plumer quotes, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" He clearly says Electoral College needs to be abolished, over & done with.Because they don't have logical information on everything they do. And they only have practical reasoning, not liberal or conservative reasoning.

Next reason, their method is not bulletproof as they claim it to be. No method is perfect, but the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope in succeeding. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..."" He is saying the way the method is set up, makes it seem worthless to even vote for the person you choose or chose.

Finally, my last reason to why we should keep with changing to election by popular vote is confusion.The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Some candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning because of the winnertakeall system. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is pretty selffish and ridiculously unfair.

However, having the election by popular vote has it's flaws as well. Such as the certainty of outcome. Electoral College having a dispute over the outcome of an election is possible, but it's less likely than the popular vote. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" He is simply stating that if there is a difficulty in the popular vote election, they have an electoral vote to choose the winner.

Those are my very important, detailed reasons why we should change to election by popular vote. Recap, fairness is important & is needed in any method, the Electoral College method is not as solid as they believe it to be, & all of the confusion the Electoral College puts off to some states.",0
"Most people ask more than one person for advice there are many reasons for this but I'm going to say three reasons why I think people asking more than one person for advice is good.

One reason I think must people do this is to see which idea was the most responses. Another reason is you could test every idea that you get.

One last reason is some of the people could agree with the other person.

People try to ask a good amount of people just in case they hear more than one response from someone.

This is good to hear a lot of ideas and to see how many you get from the people you ask.

Don't ever be afraid to ask for advice from more than one person.

Maybe you have had to do this maybe you have had someone else ask you for advice.

Well i sure did I've had lots of times where I have asked someone in my family for advice.

Sometimes you are able to test some of the ideas you get.

This depends on what type of advice you are trying to take from someone.

Maybe you might be building something small like a shed and you have never built something before but you are determined to build it.

So you go and ask a friend that you know to tell you a few things on doing this job but before you go and build you go and practice on something so you know what to do.

I can relate to this you may even be able to relate.

I'm trying to build a tree house and I have had to ask for advice on building the treehouse.

The last reason is that one of the people you asked for advice may say or think the same thing as someone else that you asked for advice for.

Some don't think all the same things if you were to ask a bunch of people for advice they will not all give you the same answers but they will sometimes have the same meanings to them.

I think everyones ideas and try to show respect and listen but I don't take too much advice just in case that advice doesn't sound quite right like I said before don't be afraid to ask someone for advice.

Some people will disagree with my three reasons but I don't like to listen to the people who disagree with my reasons.

Maybe this helped you maybe it didn't.

To see which ideas was the most responsive ideas, you could test every idea you asked for and some might agree with one of the other ones you took advice from those are my three reasons on why most people take advice from more than one person.",0
" I believe that the act of kindness can have a profound impact on someone, but it ultimately depends on the individual and their personal experiences. Kindness is something that we should all strive for, but it's important to understand that it can mean different things to different people.

For some, being kind simply means being nice to someone, while for others, it may involve going above and beyond to help someone in need. Regardless of the specific definition, kindness can be a powerful force in bringing people together and creating a sense of community.

I think it's important to remember that everyone has a little bit of kindness within them, even if they may not always show it. Those who have been fortunate enough to have kind friends and family members in their lives are likely to be more empathetic and compassionate towards others.

However, it's also important to recognize that not everyone may respond to kindness in the same way. Some people may have been hurt by others in the past, making it difficult for them to trust or accept kindness from others. It's important to be aware of this and to approach kindness with sensitivity and understanding.

Overall, I believe that the act of kindness can have a profound impact on someone, but it's important to approach it with empathy and understanding, taking into account the individual's personal experiences and perspectives.",1
"Dear Principle,

I believe that only allowing students with a grade B average to play sports is wrong and unfair. This is because without sports, students will lose their hobbies and it can get in the way of sporting careers that they may want to follow. Students can also get scholarships for sports which can help a lot if they're not strong in other subjects.

Some students only like one thing. Sports. If they can't do the one thing they enjoy they may give up in school which will only lower their grades. Banning sports from the majority of the school might also lead the school to forfeit their games because they might not have enough players to play the game.

Another reason why this rule is unfair is because maybe a student is aiming to get a scholarship in college from their athleticism. This is because they want to go to college to get a good job but might have a hard time making it because they aren't doing so well in school. Therefore, students start sports to go to a good college.

To achieve a good sporting career, many students start on school sports teams and gradually get better and better at the sport they love. If students aren't allowed to play on the sports team just because they have an average grade in school they can't follow their career of choice and they might end up with a job that they do not enjoy.

As you can see, banning sports from the majority of the school can lead to students lowering their grades and the school forfeiting their games. This also takes away the rights of students. This rule should not be made because it is unfair to most of the students.",0
"I along with other students, hate summer projects especially when a teacher designs it. As you can already tell i'm against teacher designed projects, and here is why.

When a teacher designs a summer project or any project in that matter it can be very uninteresting, which increases the chance that a student would just forget about the project or put in a low effort. Teachers these days give out more online work than paper, and anything online can be easily forgotten. Due to the fact that its online means that students would have to stay inside and not do what they've planned for the summer. Some students work efficiently if its on paper rather than a computer. What i'm trying to say here is that summer projects should not be designed by teachers.

A big reason why students should be the designers is because that teachers lack something the fresh minds of young students have. That something is creativity, believe it or not creativity can get you far in life and it even makes school work a lot easier and fun. Doing anything in the same old fashioned traditional way can be tiresome and repetitive ,but doing work or anything can be a lot more enjoyable and easy if you think of a creative way to do it. There is no reason at all a student should not be able to complete a project they designed themselves.

Now I know some people think teacher designed summer projects are more direct and easy to follow this is false because if you make the project you know all the steps and how to follow them.

In conclusion students should be the ones designing summer projects not teachers.",0
"We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College is corupt compared to popular vote. They're more cons than pros about  the Electoral College. A lot of people agree that we should change our voting to popular vote. Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important.

The Electoral College System is wrong. In source two, Bradford Plumer said that ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said ""they can be anyone not holding public office"" and ""electors could always defy the will of the people"". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said ""when you vote for your canadidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector's"". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate.

The Electoral College system is said to be unfair to voters in source two. The Electoral College system has a ""winner-take-all"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winner-take-all"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". I agree with plumer, the Electaral College needs to go.

Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros. In source three Posner give you the ""five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". Posner said the first reason was ""certainty of outcome"". The second reason is ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal"". the third and fourth reason is ""swing states"" and ""big states"". the fifth reason is the Electoral College system can ""avoid run-off elections"". These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness?

We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a ""winner-take-all"" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"". Source two was right we need to put an end to the Electoral College system!                                         ",0
"As an average 8th grade student, I have to say that I find the prompt to be really interesting. In my opinion, there are many ways to influence someone without using technology, Google translator, or YouTube. While these tools can be useful in some situations, they are not the only ways to make an impact on someone's thoughts or actions.

One way to influence someone without technology is through personal interactions and communication. For example, having a face-to-face conversation with someone can be much more effective in persuading them than sending them a message through a screen. This is because nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, can convey emotions and sincerity in a way that text messages cannot. Additionally, building a personal connection with someone can make them more likely to listen to and consider your perspective.

Another way to influence someone without technology is through shared experiences and common interests. For instance, if you and someone else have a common hobby or passion, you can use that as a way to connect with them and share your ideas. By finding common ground, you can build trust and credibility, which can make it easier to persuade them to see things from your perspective.

However, I do think that technology and other tools can also be useful in certain situations. For example, if you are trying to reach a large audience or spread awareness about an issue, using social media or other online platforms can be an effective way to do so. Additionally, technology can provide valuable information and resources that can help support your arguments.

In my opinion, the impact of examples vs. other ways of influencing depends on the situation and the audience. While personal interactions and shared experiences can be more effective in some cases, technology and other tools can be more useful in others. For example, if you are trying to reach a large audience or spread awareness about an issue, using social media or other online platforms can be more effective than trying to have personal conversations with each person individually.

Overall, I think that there are many ways to influence someone without using technology, Google translator, or YouTube. While these tools can be useful in certain situations, they are not the only ways to make an impact on someone's thoughts or actions. By using a combination of personal interactions, shared experiences, and technology, you can be more effective in your efforts to",1
"Title: The Importance of Soccer in Physical Education

Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay about the history of soccer and how it relates to physical education.  I know, I know, it might seem like a weird combination, but trust me, it's actually pretty cool! 😃

So, did you know that soccer has been around for like, forever?  It originated in ancient civilizations like Egypt, China, and Greece! 🤯 It's crazy to think about how a sport that's so popular today has such a rich history. 

But here's the thing: soccer isn't just some ancient game that we play for fun.  It's actually a great way to build skills like teamwork, speed, and agility!  When you play soccer, you have to work together with your teammates to score goals and defend your team's net.  It's like a big game of tag, but with better ball handling skills! 😉

And get this: research shows that participating in physical education can actually lead to enjoyment!  Like, who knew?! It's not just about running laps or doing push-ups.  It's about having fun and staying active.  When you're having fun, you're more likely to stick with it and make it a part of your daily routine. 

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But wait, don't the rules of physical education and soccer clash?""  Not really!  Both involve working together as a team, but the rules of soccer are actually more relaxed than you might think.  For example, in soccer, you can use your hands to control the ball, but in physical education, you have to stay inside the designated playing area.  It's all about finding that balance between having fun and following the rules.

"This face is not a creation of aliens. It is a natural landform. You can tell this is a natural landform because in the story it says that the caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" That is saying that it only looks like a face because of the shadows.

It says that ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" So that means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This is saying that if it was a creation of aliens you would be able to tell. In conclusion the Face is not a creation of aliens it is a natural landform. There was no evidence showing that an alien of some kind created this Face. It was clearly the shadows making it look like a Face.            ",0
"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about how influence can be good or bad, and how it affects people. Influence is like, when someone does something or says something that makes you wanna do or say something too. It's like, a vibe, you know?

So, the positive side of influence is when someone does something cool or nice, and it makes you wanna be cool or nice too. Like, if your friend is super into playing guitar, and they teach you how to play, you might get really into it too. Or if your sibling is super into drawing, and they show you how to draw, you might get into it too. That's a good kind of influence.

But, the bad side of influence is when someone does something that's not cool or nice, and it makes you wanna do the same thing. Like, if your friend starts smoking, and you start smoking too, that's not good. Or if your sibling starts bullying someone, and you join in, that's not cool. That's when influence can be bad.

The impact of influence on people is huge. It can make you do things that you might not have done otherwise. Like, if you're hanging out with someone who's really into sports, you might start playing sports too. Or if you're hanging out with someone who's really into music, you might start listening to that kind of music too. It can also shape your beliefs and opinions. Like, if you're hanging out with someone who's really into a certain political party, you might start believing the same things they do.

So, in conclusion, influence is a big deal. It can make you do things that are good or bad, and it can shape your beliefs and opinions. It's important to be aware of the influence of others, and to make sure you're not doing something that's gonna be bad for you. Like, always think before you act, and make sure you're not getting influenced into something that's not good for you. Cool? Cool.",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to discuss with you the new cell phone policy you are thinking of making for this school. I think you should let us use our phones during lunch and free time because we could then get in touch with our parents if we had to. Another reason is that if we needed the homework for something we could then contact a friend. The last reason is because this would give us something to do during x-block or lunch if we don't have anything to do. I would like you to please read my letter to consider the idea.

Cell phones should be allowed at lunch and free times because if our parents needed to contact us for an important reason then we would be able to. For example if one of our family members got injured and we couldn't use our phones then how would we know that. Or if your parents couldn't be home for you after school and you had to go to a neighbor's house you wouldn't know. Having phones available to be used during lunch and free times could definitely benefit communication with our family's for important reasons.

Just say you forget your homework for Spanish and you know a friend in another home room has the same teacher as you, instead of getting up and walking their you could text him an ask for the homework. I think that this could improve the percentage of completed homework assignments. I know that I sometimes forget to write down my home work in my planner so if I could text someone to find out what it was I could get it done. I know that your probably thinking you can do that after school, but if you have many activities like me you will be really busy, and might forget to ask.

My final reason is that sometimes you have no home work and just sit around during x-block and talk. Some teachers don't like when you talk and get mad. If we could use our phones then we could talk to each other, but it would be quiet, so the teachers can't hear any noise. I'm not saying it would be one hundred percent quiet, but it would definitely make a difference. Having phones at x-block could definitely keep kids busy and maybe even out of trouble.

I conclusion having phones could really impact our school in many ways. It could keep family's closer if they are needed and maybe even help kids get homework if they forget it. This could maybe help bring up the percentage of homework assignments completed. This could also keep kids busy if they have nothing to do at x-block. Keeping kids busy at x-block could even lead to less kids getting in trouble. Thank you for reading this and I hope you considered my reason.

Sincerely,

Imagine you're on a cattle boat about to dock. You are helping by giving the animals away to poor people. Well Luke Bomberger did just that. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 time and the Pacific Ocean twice to go help peole that were stuggling. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy because you would help people in need, it's a once in a lifetime expirience, and it is fun.

In my opinion, being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun. Other might think it isn't fun at all. However, in the text it states that the cowboys play basketball and volleyball. The text aslo states that they would have table tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading, and they would play games. These details prove that maybe you'll have fun being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I believe that it is an once in a life time expirence. Others might look the other way and think the opposite. However, Luke said that it was a once in a lifetime expirience. Also, in the text it said that Luke got to see the Panama Canal. These details prove that maybe you'll get to see a lot more if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

I belive that becoming a Seagoing Cowboy helps people. Some people think that you could get hurt yourself then who whould help you?

"From reading the passage, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I disagree from the idea of creating a car that will transport people without the need of a driver.

Why I strongly disagree with the thought of this idea is simply because something bad could go very wrong. Have you asked yourself, ""what if a car was built wrong?"" In that case, the car wouldn't work right and no one would even know. Just because it was designed to go from one destination to the next doesn't mean something could go wrong. Then the passengers in the car could get severely hurt. Passengers wouldn't be able to take over the car and avoid an accident. When reading the passage, the narrator talks about cars and how cars need the driver just in case there's an incident on the road, and only the driver would know how to get around that.

This is one out of many reasons why i think driverless cars shouldn't be created.",0
"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about how cellphones can be used in classrooms for learning, right? Like, I know some schools already use them for stuff like taking attendance or looking up stuff on the internet, but I think they could be used way more.

First of all, cellphones can be super helpful for research. Like, imagine you're doing a project on ancient Egypt or something, and you can just pull out your phone and look up pictures of pyramids or mummies instead of having to carry around a whole book. Or you can use it to look up definitions for words you don't know, like if you're learning a new language. That would be way easier than trying to find a dictionary in class.

And cellphones can also be good for communication. Like, if you're in a group project and you need to talk to your group members, you can just send them a message on your phone instead of having to go find them during class. Or if you're in a class where you need to ask a question, you can just send a message to the teacher instead of raising your hand. That would be way faster.

But there are also some potential issues with having cellphones in class. Like, if kids are distracted by their phones, they might not pay attention to the lesson. Or they might use their phones to cheat on tests. So, the teachers would need to figure out ways to keep kids focused and on track. Maybe they could have a ""phone-free"" time during class, or they could use apps that block distracting websites.

And what about in case of family emergencies? Like, if someone's parent or sibling is in the hospital or something, they might need to be able to contact them quickly. If they have their phone in class, they could call or text their family member right away. That would be way better than having to go home and use a landline phone.

So, overall, I think cellphones could be really useful in classrooms if they're used correctly. But it's important to figure out how to use them in a way that's fair for everyone and doesn't distract from learning. And also, it's important to have emergency plans in place in",1

"Dear Principal,

Firstly I believe that you should allow students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

I believe this, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME for my seventh grade year we were allowed to have our phones during lunch and other free time as long as it was in are lockers during classes.

Also then if students needed to call their parents to come and get during the school day when they couldn't remember their parents number, they could get a hold of them.

Secondly when students are allowed to have their phones during lunch and other free time the students most likely to keep their phones in their lockers during classes, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME the student who had phones in class was less.

That was a good thing so the teachers could go through all the lessons they had planned for this class period.

And thirdly then there was less students getting in trouble, and less cell phones getting taken away from the students.

That is why I believe that student should be allowed their phone during lunch and other free times, thank you for your time.

"Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American essayist, philosopher, and poet who lived in the 19th century. He is best known for his works such as ""Self-Reliance"" and ""Nature,"" which emphasize individualism, self-discovery, and the importance of living a life of purpose. Emerson's message was to encourage people to live their lives with authenticity and to embrace their individuality. He believed that people should strive for self-improvement and personal growth, rather than simply following the crowd.

In modern society, Emerson's message is still relevant. Many people today are caught up in the rat race, trying to climb the corporate ladder and accumulate wealth and possessions. However, this focus on material success often comes at the expense of personal fulfillment and growth. Emerson's message to embrace individuality and live a life of purpose is a reminder to prioritize personal development and to not let societal expectations dictate one's path in life.

Furthermore, Emerson's emphasis on the importance of living a life of purpose is particularly relevant in today's society. With so many people pursuing multiple careers and interests, it can be easy to become lost in the noise and lose sight of what truly matters. Emerson's message to focus on one's passions and to pursue them with authenticity and purpose is a reminder to prioritize what truly matters in life.

In conclusion, Emerson's message to live a life of authenticity and individuality is still relevant in modern society. His emphasis on personal growth and development, as well as the importance of living a life of purpose, is a reminder to prioritize what truly matters in life. It is important for people to not let societal expectations dictate their path in life, but to instead pursue their passions with authenticity and purpose. By doing so, individuals can live a life of fulfillment and make a positive impact on their community.",1
" The Benefits of a Positive Attitude.

A positive attitude is often associated with success in life, and for good reason. It is the way in which people approach problems they face and the hope they need to achieve their goals. A positive attitude can change the way people view adversities, making them easier to overcome and ultimately leading to success.

First, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it helps people not to give up. In the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities,"" many successful individuals had to face difficult times before achieving their goals. However, they always maintained a positive attitude towards the problems they faced, which gave them the hope they needed to keep going. A positive attitude can help people see the good side of things, even in the darkest of times.

Additionally, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier. When people have a positive attitude towards a problem, they are more likely to look for solutions instead of becoming stuck. This attitude can help people overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. A positive attitude can also help people attract good things into their lives, making success more likely to come their way.

Some people may argue that a positive attitude is not the only factor in achieving success. They may point to successful individuals who did not have a positive attitude, or to those who achieved success through hard work alone. While it is true that hard work and determination are important, a positive attitude can help people overcome obstacles and stay motivated. It can also help people attract good things into their lives, making success more likely to come their way.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is an important factor in achieving success in life. It can help people not give up, make things easier to overcome, and attract good things into their lives. While hard work and determination are also important, a positive attitude can help people stay motivated and focused on their goals. To be positive in life is an important step towards achieving success and living a happy and fulfilling life.",1

"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes. That is the best thing schools could do for the students.",0
"When you are faced with a decision, how do you go about making that decision? Many people ask others for their opinion and what they would do. This is a great strategy because, if you only ask one person they'll probably give you their opinion based only on their life experience, you can make the decision that the majority of people would have suggested, and some of the people will help you see from a different perspective what the decision actually is and how it will effect the rest of your life. These people can be very helpful in decision making.

The first reason that seeking multiple opinions can help you make the right choice is that, if you just base your decision off of one person, that person will probably be advising you in making that decision based on a life situation that they have been in that either effected how they made that decision or would effect the outcome of what they eventually decided to do. This can be bad because you might not be in the same situation as that person was in when they made the choice that they did. Also, that person doesn't know what you are going through and what this decision has in store for you. When you act off one persons opinion, the choice that they made might have led them down a good path, but, even if you make that same choice, there might be something different that's waiting at the end of that same path for you. So, when you take their advice and make the same choice that they did, keep in mind that it can negatively effect you afterwards or during the decision-making process, or it can leave you in a different situation than it did them.

Next, if you get multiple opinions you have the opportunity to do what the majority of people have chosen or would chose to do. Many people do this, and it can be quite helpful. People will often do this because they assume that most people will make the right choice when faced with a decision. There is also the fact that, if the people that made a certain choice seem as though they are in a good place in life and that their life isn't terrible because they made that choice, that is the choice that most people will make and the path that most people will take. In addition to this, most people feel that if they make the choice that other people did and those people got a good result out of it, that is the decision that should be made because people want to get what they think is the best possible outcome for them in general, and when faced with a decision.

Finally, when you get multiple opinions the people that give those opinions will sometimes also give you advice and help you find a new perspective on what the decision and the choices actually are and what they really mean. This can be very helpful because if you don't look into your future at what each of the possible paths can lead you to, you could make the decision and realize that the situation you would end up in is a terrible place to be in life, or you could look into your future with the help of the people around you, and make the choice that would put you in a good place afterwards. Also, if you aren't paying much attention to what you are actually about to do, you might not realize that the situation at hand is going to effect you way more than you let on. This can be very bad because, like what was previously stated, this can put you in a very bad place in life. Additionally, if you find multiple opinions on the situation those people can help you depict the question that is being asked of you and the possible choices that could be made and where they would put or leave you, so that you know what is really being asked of you and don't make the decision blindly.

In conclusion, there are many reasons that people would look for multiple opinions while making a decision. Namely, if you base your decision off of one person you might make a choice based off the situation that person was in when or if they were faced with that choice, you can take the most abundant response because the people that responded with that might be in a better place in life than the people who made different choices, and lastly, the people you ask can help you find another point of view on the situation to help you better understand the decision that is being or need to be made.",0
"Have you ever been put in a position where a decision is hard to make on your own and you may need the advice of others? Sometimes you'll need to ask others for advice to get the best outcome. It won't ever hurt you to ask for advice from others. Asking for more than one opinion helps you see all different viewpoints, the best possible answer, and less pressure.

When you ask multiple people for advice on something you get many different viewpoints. This will help you because you can depict between all the advice you receive and have a less bias answer. I always prefer to get different view points because it makes me feel reassured knowing I have many options to go about with my decision. For example, if I am shopping for a dress and I see a cute one but i'm not sure about it i'd ask my friends for their opinion, and that will help my final choice. With multiple viewpoints you can have a more thought about answer with the pros and negatives. Every viewpoint will either be different or possibly even the same which will narrow down your answer.

Making decisions are always going to be stressful which is why asking for others for advice is good because it'll bring less pressure. Your decision may be big or large but no matter what it can always be stressful, so when you ask for advice it can take some pressure off of you. I always find it to be less stressful when I go to someone and tell them i'm having a hard time with a decision and they give me some advice to go about it. Sometimes you just need to relax before any type of decision. Would you rather have a very stressful decision to make on your own or a big decision with advice from others which will bring less stress. Big decisions can cause bad stress which may result in a loss in appetite and could also make you sad or have anxiety. However, if you do ask someone for help on your decision you can avoid all of that stress and have a better out come.

Asking others for advice will almost always leave you with a better outcome.

I know this because without seeing how other people view this decision will just be a bias answer and probably not that good of a decision. Sometimes you just need to take a moment to think of others opinion and think if they'd agree with your decision. If you think about it and you're having second thoughts, then it's probably not the best decision you can do. Like for instance, I made a decision to play games instead of watch a movie for my class and many people were upset with me, which made me realize I have to take others viewpoints into the picture. However, if you ask other people for their opinion then you can see if their opinion differs from yours and work on a new one.

With all of that being said asking others for advice can bring less stress a better outcome and many viewpoints. If you ask for advice you can take time is review and reflect on what the best possible outcome for you and others may be. Therefore, leaving you with a well thought about answer.",0
"The use of this technology in a classroom is valuable to read the emotional expression of students when he/she steps into the classroom to know what exactly is they're facial emotion representing.

This new sofeware called Facial Action Coding System is proven to read six basic facial emotions such as, happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. The sofeware is like math it can calculate you all your forty-four major facial muscles and calculate your emotion. For like example , if you raise both of you eye brows it most likley means that your facial expression is showing that your suprised to hear or see something.

I think that this sofeware is a pretty nice technology that can be usefull if your a teacher, rehabilatation center helper. For a teacher it can be a good technology to use at school so you can know more about the kids facial expression. It'll become a great technology for a rehabilatation center ,for veteran solders the have gone through a lot and are hiding other extra emotions.

Thomas Huang , of the Beckman Institute for Advance Sience at the University of Amsterdam did a great sofeware that will become very usefull to many places. It will help many people as well to know what extra emotions they are hiding that the sofeware can find for them.    ",0
"Dear, principal or Board of education

Community service, you want children to do community service my opinion for that is they should in some way and in another they shouldn't .

Opinion one in some way the children should help out picking up trash and help with other things grownups cant do it all the time .Sometimes they need help so you should get involved and help out every once in awhile.

Opinion two in some way children should not help out .You have too think children need every minute of their life with education . This cant be during our time of learning that help us when we get older. Children shouldn't do community service not in till they get little bit older . Time is money and money is in our education to go to college and be successful in our everyday lives.

My point is think about what you put off make the right decision see where the children are if they have extra time they could it after school . Otherwise do what's best for you.

"When was the last time you drove a car? Studies have shown that the amount that people have driven over the last couple of years has gone down. There are lots of advantages to limiting car usage. Some of them include: less gas emmisions, emptier and safer streets, and new innovations to compensate for the reduction of car usage. Plenty of cities around the world have attempted limiting car usage.

To start off, if citizens limit their car usage, there would be less gas emissions. But, unfortunately there are still plenty of greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. There are other options to do instead of driving, you could skate, bike, walk, or etc. The gas emissions are a huge problem in today's society and we have to change something about the way we live. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, they have a car-free day once a year.  This reduces the smog that is kept in the air from the gas emissions.

Continuing on, if citizens limit their car usage, we would have safer streets for sure. With less cars driving up and down the street, kids can feel free to play in the street without having to worry about a reckless driver coming down and mowing them all down. Even suburban planners in the US are trying to create ""car reduced"" communities. Instead of using cars, public transportation is becoming the new thing.

Lastly, with people not using cars to get everywhere, some innovations would be made. Side walks would be reconstructed, less rush-hour traffic, new restaraunts and shopping districts within walking distance, and parks and sport centers would blossom. In Bogota, all of those have blossomed since they have started it back in the mid-90s. With the end of car culture also, new innovations have to spring up.

To close out, cars are being used less and less. And they should be because they cause gas emissions, unsafe streets, and bad construction. But, we are slowly moving away from that culture and who knows what into!    ",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The majority of the advantages are towns that are closer together and car accidents will be much more widespread and unlikely. Only in some cases will people use cars, and in those cases it is only for doing long distance transport, such as driving across the country. The most important and final advantage is that it would reduce emmissions from all cities if it is done in the major cities of the United States, and everywhere else.

The first example of the advantages that I will use is the closer together cities. We know that Germany has already made an emmission free city, and you have to pay a lot of money to be able to park, or even drive. The city has closer together work places, restaurants, and stores, so it is easier for people to make a quick run to the grocery store on their walk home, rather than having to travel for 30 minutes to get to the grocery store, spend an hour there trying to get your food, and then traveling home for another 30 minutes. Overall, the closer cities with high prices to use a car will be better for our planet, and reduce emmissions from many countries on the planet.

The second advantage that reducing car usage has, is that it would widely reduce the amount of accidents people have every year with cars. Bike accidents would happen more, but they would be less likely to hurt someone severely, or even take a life. This means that more lives would be saved with the use of less cars.

The final advantage is reducing emmissions. If we keep moving along the pace that we were moving along when we were at our high point, Earth could end up looking like Venus much sooner than we thought. Although it may not be in our lifetime, we don't want to mess up the future for our children or grandchildren. If we do reduce emmissions, and keep Earth as the ""little blue dot"" in our galaxy, then we are doing something great for the human race, and we should keep doing this as we move along in everything we do.

To sum everything up, if we start creating closer together cities, emmissions from all vehicles will be reduced, and many less accidents will happen in which someone will be killed. Reducing emmissions will save our human race in more drastic ways than we can imagine, and it would most likely help us keep our planet the way we started with it. Green, blue, and white.    ",0
"studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start after school to do homework. teachers and students have egry to staying after school to help other students that need help with their homework. some teachers need help other teachers have egry to help other teachers to do their work.

some students don't want to stay after school because they want to go home to play video games, but i think is a good idea to stay after school so students can ask questions to the teachers about homework.

students have shown that staying after school can help them to do homework, it can help students bring their great up to an A and Lord more then what they now, teachers can help other students to study, so more students can under Stan, doing homework after school is a good way to do it because wen you at home some times you are confuse so the better way to do homework is to stay after school to do it with your teachers and it can help teacher to, so the next day they don't have to teach them what she or he have learn.

teachers and students have to make a minting after school about helping students to do their homework after school some schools don't do that because students dont want to do nothing after school so teachers have to make a students to staying after school to do homework some students go home and they come next morning with there homework not done, some times is the teachers fold because they dont want to help students to stay after school to do homework or to study, so students can bring their great more up then what they have.

teachers shut do tutoring after school because some students want to go home and play video games or listing to music or videos on YouTube wen they haven to do their homework, some parents they dont event asked their child rends that if they did their homework, so teachers shut start doing tutoring after school so students do homework and parents dont have to worried about that because they now that thy stay after school to do homework, some student want to stay after school because wen they go home some times they dont Eben now how to do their work so some students want to work with their teachers so they can under stand more.

some students want to stay after school to do their homework with their teachers but some dont want to or students dont want to stay after school,l they shut do tutoring after school because student can learn more they can do their homework teachers can help them is a nice idea for students and for the school so some students can bring their grate up, students some of them dont want to staying after school because they want to go home and listing to YouTube or play video games and they dont bring their homework to school.",0
" Did you know that one of our students recently won a 1000 dollars cash prize for participating in one of our school activities? Our principal emphasizes the importance of students participating in at least one activity, and after seeing the positive impact it had on the student who won the prize, I agree with this decision.

Participating in school activities can help students build relationships with their peers. Whether they are new or old students, they can find new friends and expand their social circle. It can also help them overcome shyness and boost their self-confidence.

Additionally, school activities can provide students with valuable skills and experiences that can help them excel in their future careers. For example, students who are good at art or sports can showcase their talents in art shows or competitions and potentially earn a college degree in those fields.

Moreover, school activities can help students discover their passions and interests. Students may have hidden talents that they are not aware of, and participating in activities can help them explore and develop these skills.

In conclusion, participating in school activities can have numerous benefits for students. It can help them build relationships, gain valuable skills and experiences, and discover their passions. I believe that this is a great opportunity for students to enhance their academic and personal growth.",1
"When you don't know something, you ask someone. It is what everyone tells you to do, ask questions. Well most of the time you ask more than one person. Why? When i'm trying to get information from a person I look at their experience, viewpoint, and also for accurate results. It gives people more ideas to think of on a topic.

I look at their experience because it gives me a better idea of what the person is like or has been through. For example if their family is democratic and I ask this person if I should vote for a republican, they will most likely say not to vote for the republican because of their experience with their family. If it is an issue like skydiving and I want to do it but i'm not sure. I will ask someone who has been skydiving for advice, because they have been through it and they tell me what I would expect. Maybe I ask a person for advice on something and they know a person that went through the same thing I am. When i'm sick I want to know what it's going to be like, so I would ask my friend who has a family member that has had this sickness and they would tell me what to expect.

Another reason why seeking multiple peoples opinions is for looking at their viewpoints. When you have your opinion on an issue you want other people to see your way or feel the way you do about the issue. So when you ask more than one person you are seeing the other persons viewpoint. This is why you should ask multiple people for their opinions. They also might be bias towards the issue because someone else told them their opinion and they now agree with that and really don't like the other issue so they like theirs so much. If you have multiple people to talk to you will have each persons different viewpoints and you will be able to look at the pros and cons, then you will be able to decide on what you think.

When you talk to more people the more accurate the results get because the amount of people. If you are only talking to one person. You only have persons opinion to go by and you don't know if their are more ways or ideas on how to do that thing. Different people know might know more things than just one person, for example if you talk to a smarter person they will know more than a person not as smart. When you are talking to more people the wider the results and more accurate they get. It is a positive correlation, which means if you have more different variety of people the more accurate and better the results.

If you still think that talking to one person is better than talking to multiple just remember. When you talk to more than one person you look at their experience, viewpoint and when talking to different people it gives you more accurate results. So next time you have a question or want to know an opinion on something. Ask multiple people it is the best thing you can do.                                                     ",0
"Dear principal,

I think the policy should allow us to have cell phones. There are certain reasons why. But i also think that if students get carried away using them until the fact that they use them during class that they should take them away from the people using them at that time and return them at the end of the day. I only like to be fair because I would love the chance to get to have my cell phone out. I will explain more about why i think this in the paragraphs below.

Lots of people get sick at school and need to go home. Some people stay in the restrooms and call or text their parents to come get them but the calling noises always bring attention to teachers and you usually get it took. If your sick and have no way to call your parents from the office then you should be able to call or text from where ever you are. But if it comes to a point where people are skipping class to go text then they should take that privilege away.

Almost everyone has a cell phone and love to text their friends. But when it comes to the no cell phone policy at school well trust me I understand. hours without calling or texting is like a day without happiness. You hear all these other kids calling and texting in class but don't get caught, then you try it and you get caught and your phone gets took by the teacher. You could never understand why that happens so of course you feel like your trapped without your cell phone.

The no cell phone policy is unfair in my opinion. We all love our cell phones and never want to have to put them up. This is why I am agreeing to the policy allowing cell phones in free time and not in class. No student likes to give up their cell phone. And I completely understand them.

"I am very one sided with the way I feel about driverless cars. I feel that driverless cars are dangerous and hazardous. The cars could be more prone to crashes then when a person is at the wheel. ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This states that the cars are safe for only a period of time. An all computerized car is just asking for the worse when it gets older.

Driverless cars aren't even really driverless, so what's the point? ""But so far, Google cars aren't truely driverless."" The idea of a driverless car may put a person to ease, to where they aren't paying attention to the road ahead. The at ease person may become stressed when the car signals to take over. They might not even be ready to take over the wheel. This is a risky thing when coming to complicated traffic issues.

These driverless cars also seem to be very expensive, something not the everyday person could afford. The car has even been know to be to costly without the price of the car itself. The article talks about the use of smart roads for the smart cars. ""These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" The car itself needs a lot of mechanics, such as Dubbed LIDAR, to make sure the vehicle can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

The article talks a lot about the future of these driverless cars. But I do not think there will be such a future. With the concern of a person's life at risk, the driverless cars will intimidate many. The cost issue will also be an intimating factor. With manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, many will not be able to afford it. Overall, the bad outweighs the good for this project. The driverless car is simply just not worth it.",0
"The technoligy I dont think will be able to read the expressions from the people in my classroom because i dont that there is such a technolighy like this because it sounds almost impossible to evr make something liike this because it was back then and back then there was not anyhting like this or even untill this day there is nothing like it

Then if there was ever something like this technoligy i dont think it will work very well considering that every one is in school and mostly when anybody is in school they are usually bummed out about being in school and i think the machine will read mixed emotions and the computer or the device will read everyones emotions wrongs because like they say id in the first paragragh how she had mixed emotions I think that that is pretty crazy to have for just one person because

I dnt think just one person can ever hve that many emotions even if was a cartoon or a painting

Lastly i dont think that everybody in my school will allow the emotion reader decide there amotions because like me I will not feel comfortable with one of those readers lie many other people in my classroom will be comfortable with that reader to decde or find out there emotions because the reader might get the wrong emotion and people might start making fun of other peoples emotions and there might be a big argument with the reader and somebody might get mad because that is not how they are feeling and people might get mad because the reader might say something about somebodys buisness and people might get embarassed about what other people might think about ther hidden emotions.

"The first policy I believe would be the best. Allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class. For example if the school's power goes out and students need to be taken home the school phones wouldn't be available. But as long as students have cell phones they can text or call their parents and tell them to come pick them up. This could apply to many other emergency's that could occur. Like an earthquake If it were to happen the power could go out. Wired phones wouldn't work but cell phones would. A cell phone could also save a students life during a fire if they were trapped in a part of the school, but no one knew where to look. They could simply just call the school to inform them that he or she were trapped and give them the location . A parent could also contact a son or daughter If something were to happen at home. If someone forgot their homework, P.E clothes or lunch they could just simply call or text their parents and have them bring it. If the students parent were to come pick up a student late they could call and tell them to go home with a friend.

There would be some negatives like a student disrupting a class with their phones, but as long as they keep them off in class their shouldn't be a problem. Anything like that could be solved with a warning and if they persist on not cooperating take away their phones and have their parents pick it up for them .      ",0
"Dear Principal,

I think Policy 1 would be a good idea ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class"". As long as the phones are off during calls then kids should be allowed to use then during lunch and floor time. Sense the rules changed and we are no longer allowed to go to the bathrooms we have to stay in class then we should be able to at least text and play games. I do not see why we are not allowed to use phones at floor. it really does not change anything except for the fact that it would keep most of us quiet. Half of the school brings there phones into class anyway. They text, go on face book, play games, some even talk on the phone. Most kids go to the bathroom to text and talk to people so I think that you should at least let people use there phones at floor. because that would probably stop most of them from texting during class if they can look forward to texting during floor and lunch time and other free times they have during school hours. I don`t see why people can not have phones during class. If something were to happen they could tell there parents what is going on or if they get in trouble they could text or call there parents to say ""pick me up at this time because i have to stay after"". This Is The Reason Why I Would Go With Policy 1.",0
"Some people like to imagine the unreal, so when a mysterious face figure was spotted on Cydonia the public blew up. Outsiders, some of them at least, thought it had something to do with aliens and a conspiracy theory, but NASA didn't seem to agree and thought it was nothing but a landform and a picture taken at the right time.

Even thought the figure does seem quite mysterious doesn't mean it's and acient alien artifact. Becuase of technlogy and how cameras dont always capture what really there. For instance, ever taken a picture of a sunset and the colors didn't look the exact same as they did in person, well, this might be the same case. ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face."" The camera might have taken the picture in a way that the human eye couldn't see. It might have added extra, or inhanced shadows making it look like a face. You'd also have to think about the angle the picture was taken in. Maybe in person from a different angle it looked like nothing but a rock, but when a picture is taken and the shadows have changed it looks like a real face with eyes, a nose and even a mouth.

Meanwhile back down on planet earth some people may be going insane and think that this has something do to with aliens and a conspiracy theory. There is no proof that the landform has anything to do with aliens except for its odd shape. Since there is no known life on Cydonia people don't know what type of strange weather or temperature changes they could've had that effected the shape of it. People tend to think what they want to believe and not look at the facts. They like to ignore whats really there and think what they want to think to create some type of excitment in their life. ""It has starred ina Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" Then when a small amount of people started to think this had something to do with aliens more people started to believe also, and thats when it went viral.

However, since no one has been down to see the strange landform nobody can confirm that it is either just a landform or an alien artifact. And it is a strange looking figure and sort of unexplainable so I can see why people first thought it had to do with a conspricy theory. But there are more reasons for it to be nothing but a landform rather than an artifact. The best thing to do is look at the facts and not believe what you want to believe just because it is exciting.

In conclusion, as exciting as it would be for this is odd looking figure to be, or have anything to do with aliens, it's nothing but a landform that looks like an alien face. And because of technolgy and peoples creative minds its features were inhanced and made to look real. You can think what you want and believe what you want, but look at the facts, it was nothing but a mere photographed mistake.      ",0
"Modern day life has been taken over by new and developing technology for over two centuries. With this comes more inovative and productive ways to go about everyday life. To put it in perspective, educational material is traditionally taught in a class room setting, however with limelight technology humans are able to take it into the comfort of their own bed. This alternative era of education has sky-rocketed online education, but is it better than the classroom. Although some may believe other wise, limtation on social skills, getting side tracked, and learning inccorectly proves students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

First and foremost, online education can impact future social skills. Getting an education online limits the number of interactions with others than compared to a students who goes to public school. On the other hand many would say this is a great option for someone who is anti-social, however this will not help with their future endevours. Online courses do give you the opportunity to work with other students, but a monitor blocks a future relationship that could have been built with others. In a classroom setting it is easier to build relationships which could possibly benefit you in the future. It is always said that connections are what get a person far in life and online classes could be the ultimate limitation from a boost in ones career.

Additionally, getting side tracked is easier in online classes than in the classroom. While taking an online class it is extremely difficult to not get your focus taken about by other things occurring around you. In a classroom you are consistently being supervised by an adult making it easier to stay focused on classwork. Personally I have taken a few online courses and I find it difficult to meet deadlines for assignments and finals because the teachers don't push you to better yourself. The teachers will tell you when the final is and that is all they will do. Online classes shouldn't be taken by someone who finds time managment to be difficult. This can then bleed into not giving your all in classwork and eventually not learning material in the best way possible for yourself.

Moreover, online classes can lead to being taught material incorrectly. It isn't clearly understood by most that online classes are prodominently self-taught and that can be consequental. Many students need to be instructed on how something is done in order to learn new material presented to them. By not understanding your personal learning style, it is possible to unintentionally set yourself up for failure. On the contrary, there are people who are able to learn better on their own, but personal experiences have proven the class room setting is more beneficial for young students due to their maturity.

To conclude, being able to attend classes from home wouldn't help students due to the possibility of learning incorrect information, being able to get side tracked easily, and causing a disruption in their social skills. This will not be benefitcial to their future and there aren't many pros to this alternative.        ",0
"Phones & driving

I strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many. So we really should not be driving with phone

Driving with phone cause more accident studies proves that also drunk driving One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective and it sad because people are dying because someone else action the innocence always gotta to suffer because of someone else's mistakes and the facts that they were on the phone sop someone might be dead or in icu because of the driver who was on the phone chit chatting. Cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk Anyhow cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action. Besides all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light. however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In reality talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us. That why ur so many accidents and people don't notice that.

Driving require our attention and we don't give it that much because our phone get all of it mobile phone use is dangerous but common because it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash Drivers' use of cell phones while vehicles are in motion should be prohibited because it is a vision distractor, it is law enforced, and it is a hazard to other drivers and passengers. Most importantly people should not use cell phones while driving. Importanly that kind of being incoredinte by other because if you want to be on the phone and while you drivng and alsmost kill yourself that doesn't mean you have jeopardized other life because you ready to end your by being on the phone it really fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. Besides using your phone while driving is really stupid because that how you can really died and that a stupid way to died cause of a phone or kill other and by other i mean motorcycle driver, a pedestrian walking across the street and or someone braking suddenly in front of you last minute because you wasn't paying attention to the road you can also get serious and bad injury from accident you should not use the phone while driving because it can cause you your life and other and it also an distraction to the road because of cell phones use you can cause inattention blindness while driving you are putting yourself and others around you in danger and placing a ban on cell phone use. while driving is proven to be effective. Did you know that distracted driving comes in three forms? When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second.

Five seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting when traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field blindfolded Many people don't realize how risky texting and driving or talking on their cell phone and driving can be cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk. To begin with, cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action first of all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours. Sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone, and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In addition, talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us a lot of people even innocent people as well have had accidents involving one of those. Out of the three there has been one that has become more common, and it's only increasing if people don't put a stop to it themselves a usage of a cell phone should not be displayed at any point while driving It can wait many have had accidents even deaths because of reading or writing a simple text messages No text is worth dying for as technology keeps on evolving quickly you'd wonder it really worth my life or a text or simply just picking up my phone.

Some accidents are common while driving they can either be minor or a major accident that can possibly result in people not making it or many car accidents have gone to notice is because of small piece of technology we always carry around, which is our cell phones. Studies have shown a major increase in simple or huge accidents because of lack of attention on the road while driving That is because of the following, people using their cell phones Banning this should take place because of the accident can lead to something worse than just a small injury while driving your phone should be kept in a place you won't hear or see it deaths have been noticed because of the simple fact that drivers tend to pay more attention to their phone instead of the road Banning on the use of phones should be enforced this has affected many innocent people with losing their life because of a driver not paying attention. But it also has some good into using cell phones or even having one while driving benefits of cell phone while driving along is that you can use your phone to call roadside emergencies, car trouble, obtain personal information, or even navigation; however, it may lead to running red lights, drifting across lanes, or worse, causing accidents phones can do so many things, but most importantly they allow you to connect to emergency service its mot needed during roadside emergencies such as ambulance, police and firefighters. Studies have shown that the use of cell phones in emergency situations, such as calling for an ambulance, has improved its mortality rates having access to a cell phone is very important when it comes down to getting important information to that certain individual and when information needs to be passed to that individual as soon as possible. The most important part of having a cell phone is navigation cell phones allow users to call for direction when they cannot find their destinations.

In conclusion it pros and cons when using cell phones you have to use it for the right reasons and not to chit chat while on the highway or even on the road where you can cause other people their life and even people who are or even pedestrian walker because they also sometimes get killed because the car curved on the sidewalk it more than just your life that you protecting it other also everybody life matter.

"Dear Principal,

I and the other students appreciate your reviewing of our school's cell phone polices, but I do not support allowing students to use cell phones during lunch and other free periods during the school day. Most students at our school do own a cell phone and carry it with them on an average school day. I do acknowledge that many students are in support of allowing cell phones to be permitted during certain times during school, but I strongly disagree.

There are several important reasons why cell phones are not allowed to be used during school. If the students are given the ability to use their phones at some parts of the day they will be tempted to use them all day.

If students know they will be allowed to use their phone during lunch and their free period, what stops them from using them in the classroom during crucial learning time for students? Suppose that during class students are texting and their cell phone's ring tone goes off while their teacher is teaching the class academic lesson.

Or Imagine students taking an important test in a classroom. A student can easily take their phone and send a text message of the answers to another student. It's that simple for students to do when a teacher steps away for a moment or turns around.

Put yourself in a gym locker room. When students are changing another student has the chance to take a photo of another student and post it somewhere on the internet.

I must stress that when the students attending school here know they will be allowed to have their phones turned on during parts of the day, there will be students who refuse to follow guidelines and rules for when the phones should be turned on and off. These problems created from allowing cell phones are an example of what could become a reality for our school.

I reassure you that prohibiting cell phones from being used in school is a rule that has been upheld with good reasoning and logic.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student",0
" Imagine getting a job that you're most passionate about and enjoy the most that later on life, you became successful or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. Life can be hard if people don't enjoy their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should prioritize their interests and pursue careers that align with them.

Students should take the time to research and explore the different career paths available to them, and choose the ones that align with their passions and interests. This will give them a sense of purpose and motivation to work hard towards their goals. Additionally, students should seek out opportunities to gain experience in their chosen field, such as internships or part-time jobs, to help them build the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their future careers.

It's important to remember that success is not just about financial gain, but also about finding fulfillment and happiness in what you do. By pursuing careers that align with their passions, students can find a sense of purpose and meaning in their work, which can lead to greater job satisfaction and overall well-being.

In conclusion, students should prioritize their interests and pursue careers that align with them. By taking the time to research and explore different career paths, and seeking out opportunities to gain experience, students can set themselves up for success in their future careers.",1
" In his famous quote, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" Winston Churchill emphasized the importance of perseverance and resilience in achieving success. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement because success is not something that comes easily; it requires hard work, determination, and a positive attitude.

One of the biggest obstacles to success is failure. It's inevitable that you will encounter setbacks and disappointments along the way, but it's how you respond to those failures that matters. You can either give up and accept defeat or use those failures as learning opportunities to grow and improve. Churchill's point is that failure is not the end, but rather a stepping stone on the path to success.

Another important aspect of achieving success is problem-solving. Life is full of challenges, and it's up to you to find creative solutions to overcome them. Whether it's finding a way to pay for college or finding a new job, you have to be resourceful and adaptable to succeed. Churchill's statement reminds us that success requires us to be proactive and not to give up in the face of adversity.

To become successful, you also need to be willing to learn and grow. Success is not just about achieving your goals, but also about becoming a better person. You have to be open to new ideas and perspectives, and be willing to take risks and make mistakes. Churchill's quote reminds us that success is not just about achieving your goals, but also about the journey towards them.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's quote ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a powerful reminder that success is not something that comes easily. It requires hard work, determination, and a positive attitude. By embracing failure as an opportunity for growth, being resourceful and adaptable, and being willing to learn and grow, you can achieve success and make a meaningful impact on the world.",1
"When we use facial expressions it lets the person you are directing the expressions to know how we are feeling. We smile because we are happy, we frown because we are sad, we raise our eyebrows because we are shocked or surprised. We use usually identify those pretty well, but a computer can identify them better. I am for the value of using techology to read student's emotional expressions because teachers need to know what bores them or what excites them.

When I first began to read this, I thought how can technology read our emotions? Then it states in paragraph 3 that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. With all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. This computer can identify 6 basic emotion: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. With that type of skill, teachers can know what students like and don't like.

Students get easily bored when it comes to school. When they come into the classroom, they don't want to do the homework or the classwork that was given to them. They want something that will entertain them and help them learn at the same time. With this new technology, student's facial expression will be identified when they like or don't like something. Teachers then can change the way the lesson is taught without changing the lesson at all as told in paragraph 6.

This is a new way to change how schools teach. More students would want to come to school and teachers would have an increase in successful students. Knowing what we didn't know is creating more ideas to the future. ",0
"The usage of Facial Action Coding Systems will change the way learning has been viewed traditionally. Students will no longer be bored or destracted from learning. The requirements are simple, having a face and 44 major facial muscles. simple right? Anyone is able to benefit from FACS.

This software works based on its ability to detect human emotions by detecting an ""action unit,"" which is trigered by the movement of a sertan muscle. Even you do similar things to this software, for example; you might be able to guess the emotion of someon based on their face expresion, right? This software works the same way but in a more accurate level.

This technology would benefit classrooms the most, for example; if the software detects a sad emotion ond the user when learning the software could make the lessong more intersting and making the student stay on track with others.

FACS could also alert teachers of students that could be having problems outside of school based on their emotions. This software can detect ""diferent types of emotions"" like happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnes as Dr. Eckman stated.

In conclusion this software would precent many benefits for schools and users. this would also make better and more interestign ways of learning for students.       ",0
"Do you think our future will be a place with cars that we wont be driving? Will they be a world full of robots for drivers or just simply the car driving itself. Every year they are getting closer and closer to inventing driveless cares, in 2009 they started or were trying to invent a driveless car. They have been thinking and fascinated these cars in television and in movies. I agree o driveless cars being used because sesing the roads, driving and assisating, and it will be safer and thats what the law or the goverments wan't.

The car has sensors and will break by itself or know when there is danger or stuff behind you when you are in reverse.

Ever sice 1980 they started to use speed sensors but that was for the speed now they are putting break sensor when you push on the break hard the breaks automaticly turn on and they stop the car really quick to avoid crashes. These sensors will help out the human driver better controle and for he could manage the car and not to spin out. More and more improvements in sensors and cuputer hardware and software are being invented for driving could be more safer.

Driving and assisting people would help with being more safe on the road. In 2003 they announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", meaning if you are driving near a traffic jam or an accident has accured you cant pass 23mph. The car can steer,accelerate, and brake themselfs, but they have touch sensors the car wont move if it doesnt feel the hands on the stearing wheel and the drivers full attention. For tye drivers wont get board they brought in-car entertaiment systems that use heads up displays, displays will turn off when the driver needs to take ove, something no availablee to drivers trying to text will the cell phone. This assistance will help people that cant see good but need to drive and handlycapp people also.

The law wants safe cars and the drivers to be safe and they are giving them cares that will be safe and drive by themself. A lot of states like California, Florida, and Nevada do not think these cars are safe so they are illegal in these states. Alot of states these cars have been proven to be more better and safer than cars that are there so it is legal to have these cars there. They dont even let them test drive how safe they are. Still if the law is changed they will have to make new laws because in the case of an accident, if technolagy fails.

This is why I agree on on the development of these cars. They are gonna be the future they will help alot of people not crash and to be more safe on the road. They are planning to have self driving cares by 2020 so we wont have to do anything anymore just hop on the cars on point A and get off at point B. The qote they use in this article ,"" The road to the truly automomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destionation every day"" goes with this article because every year of years they are getting closer and closer to 100% saftey and driverless cars. We are getting safer cars becausebthey are sensing the road, they help us with driving and assisting, and it will be sater and thats what the laws and the goverment want, to have safe cars. ",0
"Was the face created by aliens? According to the text, Mar Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1976, eighteen years after the viking mission ended. The Face is just a natural land form because NASA has not identified who could have done it,they only have images and the Face is in the ground whickh makes it a land form.

NASA does not see these faces all the time. Why is this ""landfrom"" one of a kind? Mars has been a planet for years and only has one Face. Which proves that, aliens could have created this. Maybe it is a self portrait, or a sign. The picture of the face was first taken on April 5, 1998. This gives the aliens plenty of times to create the face. On Mar the landforms are remotly the same because of the climate effects everything in a similar way.

NASA believes aliens are real. If NASA has found evidence that aliens may be real, then why don't they think aliens created this? Aliens could be capable of doing this. The Face could be an alien artifact. Maybe there are more underground built by aliens that you can not see.

This is a landform because NASA only has images. Images cn be deciving , I know from experience. This may look like a face, but is not. Sometimes things are not what they seem. In 2001 they had image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 metere per pixel in 1976.

The Face is in the ground. Being attched to the ground, not made by man is a land form. An alien is not a man even if the face is man created. It is simplily just a landform that looks like something that it is not. On Mars there are other land forms, but they just don't look like a face. The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This is not made made which makes it a lanform.

NASA has not identifed who could've made the Face. If NASA takes pictures of Mars then they should have pictures of the ""makers"". Therofore this is a landform or else they would have a picture of who could've created the Face .The Face is located at 41 degree angl north martin latitude. No prof of anyone making it. Must be a land mark because lack of evidense

The Face is a natural landform becuse they only have images, it is connected to the ground, and they have not identifed who could've made it. The lack of evidense has caused me to beileve this. It is a landform on Mars and a pretty cool looking one.",0
"After conducting extensive research on the effects of a four-day work week on businesses, it has become clear that there are multiple advantages, such as improved focus, flexibility, and job satisfaction among employees. In addition, a four-day school week can provide more time for teaching and more space for students to do their homework. Although there are potential benefits to the change, there are also possible disadvantages. For example, students may miss out on classes or be unable to keep up with the curriculum and homework. It is also worth investigating how inadequate sleep can affect students and how a four-day school week would help address that issue. Ultimately, a thorough exam of the implications of extending the four-day school week has the potential to make significant improvements to the educational experience for students.",1
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 

So, I know you want us to write about people who had a tough time but still showed a good attitude, and I gotta say, it's pretty inspiring. I mean, who doesn't love a good underdog story? 

Okay, so the first person I'm gonna talk about is Stephen Hawking.  You know, the guy who was diagnosed with a super rare disease that made him wheelchair-bound and had a super sharp mind?  He could have easily let his disability get him down, but nope! He still became one of the smartest dudes in the universe!  He wrote books, gave speeches, and even appeared on TV shows! 

Another person I think of is Malala Yousafzai.  She lived in a place where girls weren't allowed to go to school, but she still wanted to learn.  She stood up for herself and her fellow girls, and now she's a Nobel Prize winner!  She didn't let her circumstances bring her down, and she's making a real difference in the world.

Now, I know you might be thinking, ""What about someone closer to home?""  Well, let me tell you about my friend, Sarah.  She moved to a new school this year, and it was super hard for her.  She didn't know anyone, and she felt really alone.  But instead of giving up, she started joining clubs and talking to people.  Now, she's made some amazing friends and she's loving her new school! 

The thing is, having a good attitude can make such a big difference in difficult times.  It's easy to get caught up in the negative stuff, but if we can find a way to stay positive, we can overcome anything!  Like, think about it, if Sarah hadn't had a good attitude, she might still be feeling super sad and alone. *sad",1
"Dear Principle,

I personally do not think students should be required to perform community service.

I think doing community service is great and that kids should at least do some.

But if it is required then that takes away from it being a good deed.

If you want some good done you should encourage community service more but don't require it won't teach anybody a lesson if they did not chose to do so themselves.

It would be hypocritical if you require it and that does not look good for any school if they are proclaimed to be a hypocrite by the public.

So I ask you to acknowledge my opinion as it was asked.

Don't require community service.

Because when something takes up a person's free time that makes that person sad and you want a happy community don't you?

Like the saying goes all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, it would also in the world of to day make him and his community be the butt of someone else's joke and no body wants that.

Also Imagine you were an elderly person.

Would like it better if the person helping you out is there because they want to be or because they have to be.

You probably like many other people picked because they want to be because it makes you feel like someone cares.",0
"Online classes present a unique opportunity for students to learn without attending a traditional school setting. The convenience of online classes is twofold; on the one hand, they can be taken from anywhere without the need to catch a bus or spend time commuting, plus students can attend class when they are sick and don’t have to worry about being marked absent or behind in their curriculum. On the other hand, they also provide flexible schedules where students can start their day at a later time than a traditional school day, making it easier to fit around the other commitments in their lives. 

While there are obvious advantages to taking online classes, there are potential drawbacks as well. For example, constantly looking at a bright computer screen for long duration can strain eyes, and the risk of distractions due to the comfortable environment of home can be high. Furthermore, the lack of a physical classroom with peers and an instructor can also make it harder to stay motivated.",1
"When making a decision, big or small, it is very important to talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions on the same situation can make you think about multiple points of view, lead you to create your own version of the advice given to you, be a good bonding experience, and result in you feeling supported, cared for, and happy. When all of those factors add up, you are going to make the better choice to solve a problem.

Every person has different ideals, beliefs, and different ways of thinking. So, as you go around asking for advice, you will receive many unique ways of approaching the exact same situation. This will help you think about choices that never would have occurred to you if you had not asked for the advice of other people.

The best part about having multiple opinions is the fact that you can take all of it, or none of it! You can even make your own version of it based on what you think is best for you, by modifying advice that is given to you, and putting it together with your own take on the situation.

Another reason why asking for multiple opinions is a good idea, is because it is a great opportunity to bond with others and have extra help on a problem. For example, if there is someone in your class that you really want to be friends with, you can ask for their advice and have a conversation with them. If that person becomes comfortable talking to you, you are likely to become friends. Having friends with you can help you make the better choice when solving a problem.

Receiving multiple opinions allows you to have different choices, but it can also make you feel supported. Your community is an amazing place with an abundance of special people who want to help you be the best version of yourself. They care about what you do, which will make you feel much better about whatever it is you are going through, and help you make the right decision.

When you have no path to travel on when it comes to a problem that must be solved, make the choice to talk to your peers, family members, and other people in your community. This can allow you to have different opinions, make friends, and feel better, in order to work through your tough problems successfully.",0
"""It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice.

For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral collge. In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just becuase they can even though us other people do count.

The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. ""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!"" (Plumer, Source 2) and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. "".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer, Source 2) every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000.

Lastly, the electoral college is irrational like seriously what idiotic person came up with this. I will say this again, but a monkey could of made a better system than this. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes"" (Plumer, Source 2) I know this statement says it all becuase how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this.

I know that electoral college vote can help and not cause problems, but there are more problems while there is one easy fix which is popular vote.

"i think its a great idea to change the schools policy. students should be getting 3.0 and higher to play sports and activity's. all schools should change there policy to have a 3.0 grade average.

Also when you go to collage having good grades and good at a sport you'll get drafted to go pro. Every student that plays a sport want to become pro.

I know allots of students that are really good at sports , but cant play because they got a 2.0 graded average or lower. its not that hard to keep a B average in school all you need to do is do all your work and homework and pay attention in class. I bet you if you guys do this you will stay at a B average or even higher.

well if students keep a average of a C+ they should still be able to play sport and activitys.",0
"In most student's summer time,they learn different things from their break,such as work experience,new knowledge from a book,and tradition about other country;In this cause,teacher's designed is not a good choices for student's project,because teacher can not make suitable choices for students,so the way can help students more understand about what they can do in the summer project is student's designed.

When the summer break start,student can make a lot choices about their plan in the summer,for example,they can stay home,travel to somewhere,or work at some place they like;Most student's summer break have a lot different,they learn different things from their break,teacher could not really know what happen in student's break,this is why student need designed their own title.

In half way of the summer,some student might not even start making their project,in this cause if teacher give student a hard title,such as""after you read this book,what your opinion and what you learn from this book?"",then student have try rush through the book,and start making a project,it will make student have a bad project content,if student can decide they own project title,such as""base on your break,what you learn from your travel,it can be anywhere"",if student can create their own project title,it will be a lot interesting and easy.

Most student want to learn a new things from interesting activity,and spend a time on those things,and student always know what whey like to do,they can create title base on animals,vehicles,or their life experience,it will be so much fun and efficiency will improve,if they can decide their own project title.

Between teacher's designed and student's designed,student always like to make their own choices,they can learn things from activity they are interesting,talk and share experience with their friends,and have a easy project in their summer time,that's why student's designed better then teacher's designed.",0
"Our school, where we spend most of our childhood in, should be able to join any sport with any grade you have. The sport it was makes you still connected to the school. I think grades shouldn't matter because sports keep you healthy, it allows time to hang with friends and it makes you better at the sports you already do. Should we really throw that all away because of a silly grade that would matter until high school?

I strongly believe that we should let anyone with any grades to play sports. It keeps you healthy and active. Would you rather have a school with inactive kids our healthy ones? The sports we have make you run and running is good for your body. It makes your muscles stronger.

These sports are helpful. Some kids cant afford recreation sports. Then the school helps those kids and let them play. So those kids are healthy and active.

I defiantly consider that we should allow any grade kids play. They allow students to interact with friends and coaches.

Don't you enjoy having your friends on your team. When your out or not playing you can talk to them and become better friends. Also when you play sports you find people on your team that you have stuff in command with. You could be like some quiet kid then you could have become good friends with some populars just because of sports.

Lastly I think we shouldn't leave out kids just because of their grades. School sports make you better at recreation sports. They make you better, faster, stronger. When you makes a mistake in a school sport you will learn from it and become better in your town's team.

If we leave kids out just because if there grades then it wouldn't be fair. What if the kid with a bad grade is really good at soccer and you leave them out. Then the would suck all because of one grade.

I honestly think that's unfair because no one wants there school to be ""losers"". I think grades shouldn't matter because sports keep you healthy, it allows time to hang with friends and it makes you better at the sports you already do.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I hear that you are considering changing the grading policy for playing sports. I myself some what agree with you and other half I don't. I myself play sports and I love them. But I struggle in areas of school work. If you made it where you have to have a B average some kids who are very good at sports may not be able to play anymore. And it just so happens that maybe that kid is the best athlete on the team. Well maybe making the grades a higher average would make them work harder, but then some kids are not that great at school work.

Having a C average is not failing its passing. For some people having a B

average is hard to accomplish. People might this of this as a punishment. Because most kids work very hard on school, at least the athletes do. If you train really hard at a sport you should also do well in school.

I myself am a swimmer and I work every day at practice. I also make sure to put school in from of any sport I'm doing at the time. So maybe you should just make sure the kids are working hard. Or the coach of that sport could have a certain grade police that his or her athletes have to follow by. If that is the case well then I believe that it should be up to the coach.

What if a lead in a play got a C but it was one point away from a B? Does that mean that you would kick that person out of the play? Even in clubs and stuff. You don't know how hard a student could have worked to have gotten that high C. Just like sports for some people academics don't come that easy to everyone.

All i think you should have to be considered to be in any after school activities or sports, is passing grades. But also good conduct. If you don't have good conduct well then you shouldn't even be considered to be in anything at all. Maybe if you have a D it would be something to talk about, but other than that C averages are not bad at all. I mean yes a B or even and A average is much better than that. But having a C and good conduct is very good if i do say so myself.

Please consider not changing the grading policy. I think it is perfectly fine right now as it is.

Sincerely,

"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a significant change in the way we learn and work. One of the most significant changes has been the shift towards online learning. While attending classes in person has its advantages, there are also benefits to attending classes online. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits and responsibilities of attending classes online instead of attending classes in person.

Firstly, attending classes online provides students with more flexibility and convenience. Students can access course materials and lectures at any time, allowing them to balance their studies with other responsibilities such as work or family commitments. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for students who have to work part-time or full-time jobs to support themselves or their families. For example, a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes in the evenings or on weekends, allowing her to provide for her family while also pursuing her education.

Secondly, attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person. Online courses often have lower tuition fees and do not require students to purchase textbooks or other materials. Additionally, students can save money on transportation, housing, and other expenses associated with attending classes in person. For example, a student who lives far from the university can attend online classes and save money on transportation and housing costs.

However, attending classes online also comes with responsibilities. Students must be self-motivated and disciplined to attend online classes and complete assignments on time. They must also have access to reliable internet and technology, which may not always be available in some areas. Furthermore, students may miss out on the social interactions and support that come with attending classes in person. For example, students may not have the opportunity to form study groups or connect with classmates who share their interests.

In conclusion, attending classes online has both benefits and responsibilities. While it provides students with more flexibility and convenience, it also requires self-motivation and discipline. However, the benefits of attending classes online can outweigh the responsibilities, especially for students who have to balance their studies with other responsibilities. For example, a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes and provide for her family while also pursuing her education. Furthermore, attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person, which can be especially beneficial for students who live far from the university or have financial difficulties.",1
"Sure, here's my essay response:

Hey, so like, I know some people think it's a good idea for students to be able to bring their phones to school. But honestly, I don't think it's a super good idea. I mean, there are definitely some pros to it, like being able to look up stuff for class or check the time during breaks. But there are also some pretty big cons.

One of the main pros is that it can be really helpful for learning. Like, if you're in a history class and you're trying to remember some dates or events, you can just pull out your phone and look them up real quick. Or if you're in math and you need to check a formula, you can do that too. It's like, really convenient.

But there are also some cons. Like, if you're in class and you're on your phone all the time, you're not really paying attention to what the teacher is saying. And if you're texting or whatever during class, you could get in trouble. Or like, if you're in a group project and you need to work together, it's hard to do that if everyone's on their phone.

Another con is that it can be really distracting. Like, if you're in class and you see something funny on your phone, you might get distracted and not pay attention to the lesson. Or if you're texting with your friends during class, you might miss something important. It's like, really easy to get distracted.

So, overall, I don't think it's a good idea for students to be able to bring their phones to school. It's just too easy to get distracted and not pay attention to what's going on in class. And even though it might be helpful sometimes, it's not worth the distractions. I mean, we're in school to learn, not to be on our phones all the time.

I hope that makes sense! Let me know what you think. 😅",1
"An Electoral College is a process established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifed citizens. Each candidate running for President has a group of electors who people vote for when voting for the candidate of their choice. The candidate with the most electoral votes and popular votes is the new President. Although this is not a democratic process, we the people still need to keep it for various reason including, having swing states, the votes between bigger states and smaller states, and avoiding run-off elections.

Toss-up states, or swing states, mainly help the outcome of the election. Although they don't elect who becomes President, they are the ones who are more likely to really listen to the competing candidates and know who to vote for than careless voters who vote for no obvious reason or are told to. They are the most thoughtful voters, which could really help the U.S. pick a great President for the next 4 to even 8 years. The more votes from those who pay attention to the election, the better chance of having a great President.

Bigger states are important to the candidates in the election. A larger population would mean more votes, and more votes would avoid a tie between the candidates. For example, Florida is a larger state. In 2012, the popular vote was very close because Florida had more electoral votes. Wyoming, a smaller state, had only 3 electoral votes. In other words, larger states get more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states do.

The Electoral College avoids run-off elections, which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When there's a tie in votes, great pressure arises and the presidential election process is greatly complicated. The Electoral College avoids this problem, reduces the pressure and produces a clear winner.

The Electoral College may not be a democratic process and may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carring their state, but is important in a variety of ways; including swing states, votes between big and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote that may decide an election.    ",0
"School Extracurricular Activity

I agree, all students should do Extracurricular Activity in school and outside of school. I feel like it will help them out with a lot of stuff like stress and can help them find out who they really are. It can give them time to be with friends and can also give them the chance to met new people. And it can bring the teachers and students closer to each other. This would give them the chance to get to know each other and try new things out.

Extracurricular Activity's would be so helpful to the school's community. This program can also help kids not be on their phones as much. it would help kids come all together and work as a team. I feel like now in days kids dont really care about there Schools Extracurricular Activity's. I feel like a lot of kids\teens depend on this phones for answers, ideas, and etc. these ideas will show them that there are better stuff then just being on your Phone, iPad, and Computer.

These school activity's will probably also bring students and teachers closer. Student's most of the time dont like school so these Activity's can show them that school can be fun. These activity's will give kids a chance to see the bright side of school and also the true meaning. It will also teach kids that trying new things out with new people can be fun. These programs can really make a kids or teens life a huge impact.

Extracurricular Activity's can show kids how to be more outgoing and bring the shy kids out of the shy zone. These Activity's can teach kids so many life lessons. It help kids and teens who think they are lazy turn into great students. These Activity's can inspire students to do better in school and lift there grades up. It can help kids/teens find out what they truly love and what they truly dislike.

I hope my words help out community's who are thinking about putting Extracurricular Activity's in there School system. I truly agree with these activity's and think it will help a lot with kids/teens. I hope one day all schools have fun activities for there students. I think can help many students come out into the real life and show them the true meaning of life. I love this idea so much and wish the best of luck for community with these activities.

"Phones & Driving

Should humans be allowed to use their cellar device while driving a truly age old question. People should be able to use their phone only if they have a car mount and are trying to use the GPS in my opinion. Otherwise pull to the side of the road if you just have to send a call or text. I truly don't understand what is that indispensable that you have to risk not only your life but others lives by picking up your phone. Just pull in to your local fast food or store and send that text that will (I assume) complete your life.

You know people have got seriously injured doing it ........

It's crazy the number of people that have died by texting and driving. Just in 2013 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Even more telling The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. (1.6!!)

Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. 74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. These are few stats that support my thesis but the stories hit closer to home for me the story of seven year old Xzavier is particularly disturbing A driver who allegedly was texting behind the wheel hit seven-year-old Xzavier Davis-Bilbo, dragging him nearly 20 feet in the process. The crash paralyzed Xzavier, and he spent four and a half months in the intensive care unit.

He won't ever walk again. That young man was only seven nowhere close to the prime years of his life. Know he can't play sports, run to the bus stop, or even jump up for a high-five because somebody was ""allegedly"" distracted by their phone.

But I can keep control i'm not them If it's one thing I know I know that people always think they can do something until they are proven wrong. Don't be that person this isn't a game this is literally life or death. Just because you haven't hit anyone yet doesn't mean your a celestial being at driving you have just been lucky. Other counter arguments might say but what I just need to do one little thing for work or school. Myself a guilty procrastinator (this is why I am making up this class) understand this argument but just be late for work or school and do it at home. Think about it what's worse killing someone by not paying attention or being late for work/school.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion t's now illegal to hold your phone while driving in the state of Georgia, part of a sweeping hands-free law that went into effect Sunday. Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rules even tapping ""play"" on a Apple playlist while not parked face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second time getting caught. The law, signed by Gov. Nathan Deal in May, aims to curtail driving fatalities in the state. So even if you believe a astounding driver you'll go to jail so just pull over.

"Are students given enough freedom in school classrooms? Students attend school for approximately 180 days each school year. However, the work does not stop just because summer break begins. Teachers often assign specific projects to students at the end of each school year for them to complete by the time they go back to school in the fall. These projects can include reading a book, writing an essay, or completing worksheets. While some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more freedom, it is best for teachers to design these projects because they know what will benefit students the most and it is less inconvenient for teachers and students.

Teachers only assign students work that they know will benefit the students. Students may view summer projects as useless, extra work, but teachers always have reasons for assigning assignments. Many teachers' reasons for assigning summer projects is to prepare students for the following school-year. A vast majority of schools offer advanced placement courses which are very challenging and rigorous classes. In order to give students an introduction to what the class is like, teachers often assign summer projects. This helps the students in the long-run because they are given exposure to the course ahead of time.

Having student-designed projects is too much of a hassle for teachers and students. Adopting student-designed projects would require each individual student to brainstorm ideas for their summer project. Not only does it take even more time out of students' summer lives, but it also creates more work for teachers. If each student were to design their own project, teachers would have to grade each project using a different set of eyes. Each project would be unique, meaning teachers would not be able to use the same set of standards for all projects. Without having a standard list of requirement, students would not know if their project met the requirements and it would take teachers forever to grade the projects. Having one uniform assignment for all students would relieve much stress from teachers' and students' lives.

Some may argue that student-designed projects give students more freedom. Each student is creative in their own way and some may say that students are not given enough opportunities to utilize their creativity in school. Allowing students to design their summer projects would make it more enjoyable while also still learning. However, students do not always do things that are in their best interest. Instead, they take the easy-way-out.

Overall, it is in everyone's best interest to have teacher-designed summer projects. It creates less stress for teachers, and it prepares students for the next school year. Students are given freedom in the classroom in many other ways, and adding student-designed projects would make classrooms even less structured. Teacher-designed projects are beneficial to both teachers and students, and they should be used in all classrooms.",0
"Today we as humans live in a society that is controlled by the advancement of technology and as certain things become easier to access, we seem to get distracted by the objects we have at our disposal. Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.

The first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cellphones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.

Although using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.

In addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.

In conclusion, my stance in the argument on cell phone use while drives stands where I have shown in this essay. I hope you can agree with me as to why I believe in the change this will bring to our society and change the rates in accidents making our cities, town, and roads safer for everyone. This changes is a great feat that we can achieve as long as everyone is on the same page. Together we can relieve our worries of driving with care-free people driving beside us. We make our roads safer for everyone. The facts that I have stated in this essay are self-evident and require support from everyone in order to change our stands on cell phone use while driving.

"Would you be willing to join the exquisite Seagoing program? To help the many countaries that were in ruins,the 44 nations made the UNRRA.The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation, but our program is going to help them too. We have a myriad amount of exuberant people that are ready to explore the world. Our program takes you all around the world to help countries that don't have food, see beautiful sights you've never seen before, and to learn all about the places we'll go.

We will be like a spaceship zooming all over the world. We will be the altruistic people in the world ready to make our mark. The Seagoing Cowboy program is one of the best programs of all time.

"This world would never be how it is now if it wasn't for technology. Technology has made a big change to this world. Most people think it has made a positive change, and others think it's made a negative change. Technology has helped schools and business, but also has made some people's life impossible. So maybe, some people are wrong maybe having technology isn't so great after all.

Over time people stop talking to each other. Stop focusing in school, families, friends, relationships, All because of technology. If there was no technology there would be no social media. People see thing online that will make then mad and always want put it on other people and it all makes it a big problems. The relationships with those people then gets broken and never want to talk to each other again.

Before technology was created, families use to have game night, the whole family would all be at the dinner table eating their food and talking about their days. They would go on trips and have fun and enjoy their beautiful moments with friends and family. They would have a nice healthy sleep. Now it's all different. People get home from work to go watch T.V. or be on their phone all night long. People don't have family dinner anymore. This is a big problems that has effected a lot of people.

When I was younger I remember my parents giving me a lot of attention. As I started growing up it started to go away. We wouldn't go on trips anymore. We all wouldn't be at the dinner table anymore. Everything started to change, then over time I started to realize it was because of technology. They were just so obsessed with it, they never got off it. Then I got my first phone and I understood why they didn't come out of it. You always wanted to know what was going on with the drama, news, Facebook, Snap Chat, etc. That shouldn't be how this world should be running. God created this world so we can all stick together, be nice to each other, and care about each other.

If technology wasn't created then maybe everyone would be happy with their life's. Everyday would be a happy day for everyone. Even though technology has made some good impacts, I still think it would be better without it. Life will never be the same how it was before without it.",0
"You may think its a waste of your life being a Seagoing Coyboy but let's just think about it. Think of all the places you could go and see for just a little bit of work! Some may say ""Oh well

Luke wasted his life being a Seagoing Cowboy."" well they're wrong. Luke got to see so many amazing things on his way home alothough taking care of cattle and almost fallingnover i might have considered it to. What luke did was amazing helping countries get pieced together again after the war by taking cattle from one place to another. Luke said ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small town boy."" i bet they were!

You might be saying why would i waste years of my life for this? Well I say they're not wasted! Going on trips for free doing some minor work is better than staying at home eating potato chips with some doctor pepper watching who knows what like the Oprah show or somthing. I would go on the trips for the thrill of it plus i've never been out of North America so that would be fun. Oh what is that your saying? You dont like leaving your home? Well get a house boat for the cattle then you can ride withc the cattle and have modern day comforts. What now? House boats are to expensive? Then tie ballons to your house like Carl did in Up. I know I know helium and ballons are expensive. What is that? You hate traveling? Well if so why are you even reading this im trying to argue why its good to be a cattle-boater. So i came up with the perfect sollution! Buy a horse,a cow,a goat, and a boat and. BAM! You have a cattle-boat. What now? You get sea-sick well take a bag because this is a good job and im sure it pays good, because you know on a boat with stinky animals. All you'd have to do is clean thier pens give them food and water and i'm sure bathe them. See? Simple job. Besides like Luke had an opurtunity of a life time getting to see so many places. What now? Oh you dont like the ocean well then...

Buy a pool and let your imagination play out. It's not that hard right? Why would you argue about a job when you can: A. See the world, B. Do little work, and C.Help others. Thats like helpping an orphan child who has no-one to adopt them. So get off your couch finnish the doctor pepper and potato chips and get to work on Sea-cattleing!",0
"Outdoor activity parks provide people with an opportunity to connect with each other and form relationships. Not only do these parks provide a physical space for people to be active, play sports, and socialise, but they can also have profound psychological and social impacts. People are often more open to talking to strangers in these public spaces, breaking down barriers that may exist elsewhere. Furthermore, regular visitors can form strong relationships through partaking in regular activities together. In many cases, this connection goes beyond the park itself, providing people with friendships and networks that can span across geographic and cultural divides. Thus, outdoor activity parks serve as an invaluable space for social and personal connection.",1
"Every student looks forward to summer break, it's all about sunshine and going out for fun. After a long time, they are able to stop focusing on school for quite some time. Although,it is relieving to take a break, students tend to forget some knowledge once they have to return to school. This is because of the summer they just spent doing nothing that's school related. For this reason, summer projects are created. It helps students to continue the learning process and keep a hold of their knowledge. Some may argue that these summer projects should be designed by the students, others may say they should be designed by the teachers. These summer projects would end up better if designed by the teachers because teachers already know the materials that need to be learned and they can challenge their students' abilities.

Furthermore, students aren't going to be enthusiastic about a summer project, most kids these days enjoy doing anything that doesn't involve school. It's more of an obligation if they have to do summer projects. So, asking students to design a project for themselves would be like asking them to stop using their phones forever. They won't want to do it because students don't like extra work. This is when teachers come in to play, they are more knowledgeable. Teachers have spent so much time learning a certain subject. They can easily set an objective for the students because it's what they've trained for. Teachers are also aware of what needs to be learned, while students are used to being told what to learn. This makes it easier for teachers to create a project. Students, on the other hand, would sit there clueless not knowing what to create nor how to. How would they know what they need to accomplish learning from creating their own project? It would be too difficult and it's time consuming not knowing where to start. Teachers are more organized and well prepared for creating assignments, activities, and projects. It wouldn't be smart to have the students create the project knowing students are less responsible and less organized with completing tasks.

Now, some people may think: ""If students create their own project then they would do it,"" but students would rather create something to their own benefit. What I mean by this is, students will come up with a task that's easy enough to complete. Nothing challenging, time consuming, and well organized would be taken in to consideration. They don't want to create something that makes them have to think outside the box. They'd rather keep it simple. So, it's best if teachers take that responsibility. A teacher can tell what their students' weaknesses and strengths are. Which helps them create something that can be a challenge to the students' mind yet, be able to be completed as well. This will allow the student to think outside the box and be able to understand what the teacher is trying to teach them while the summer break is taking place. Once they return to school they will already have that knowledge with them because they learned it over the summer and got a hold of the lesson that needed to be learned.

To sum it up, summer projects should be designed by teachers and not students. This should be done this way because teachers have a better understanding as to what to do and how to create a project with objectives. Students are used to following instructions in order to learn, so having them create their own project to learn would be difficult to actually accomplish learning a certain topic. The teachers can set the expectations and what needs to be learned by the students;therefore, allowing them to easily follow along and complete the task. Students don't like doing work during the summer, so asking them to create work for themselves would take a lot out of them. ",0

Why Asking More Than One Person is a Good Idea.

Sometimes people ask mutable people for advice. Why people ask mutable people for advice is that more than one person is less likely to be wrong. The three main reasons that a group is less likely to be wrong are different people know different things, they often have different life experints, biases are less likely a group than one person. Asking more people is better than asking one person.

With people knowing different things. That is from that the fact that no one person has the sum toddle of human knallige. Just because two people know the same thing they may have different waste of doing it. In short asking more people will end you up with more infrmashin.

Some people may work in a job outside or inside for exeapul so asking mutable people can have different exeperints. From that asking people with different wases of doing thing so you can find the best way. Anther thing to consider is people have different acutes. With people having different life exepernts it is best to ask more than one person.

In being human comes biases so to avode them you must ask more than one person. Why biases are bad are that they waste your's and others' time. Biases also are more afotin than not wrong. Last they are baste on feelings and not facts. All of those reasons are why biases are one big part of why you should ask more than one person when looking for advice.

In short you should ask more than one person for advice. Why that is the prevesly stated reasons different people know different things, people have different life exepints, and to avode biases. All that is why asking more than one person is better that asking one.",0
"Dear Principal,

I believe that your idea is correct. Many students are not worrying about having good grades in school. Instead, they are worrying about their social life and their sports teams.

I personally play on 3 different sports teams and can easily maintain a B average. Many of my friends that are on my sports team do not care as long as they have a passing grade in school. They say that they should be focusing on sports instead of their school work. Really, it should be the other way around. School should always come before social life.

I believe that grades should be the main focus while you are in school. The reason for this is because grades are why we are in school, is to get educated. Are parents care enough about us to put us in school and give us a chance to go to college and get a career. Some students go to college to get recognized in sports. That, to me, is perfectly fine as long as they are doing good in school.

There are many advantages to having good grades in school. One advantage is that the variety of colleges or high schools you can choose from is much larger. If your GPA is low in high school or middle school, some schools and colleges will not accept your application. You could be stuck going to a community college.

These are all reasons for why i believe that our school policy should change and make their grade requirement be at least a B.      ",0
"When people ask for advice from more than one more person it is because they want to be sure about the choice and they might want to be sure that they are not wrong. People will also need other peoples choices because they are not sure if they are correct or wrong. Seeking for more advice will help you know other peoples opinions and how they feel and it will also depend on the question they are being asked. People might want others opinion because they want to know if people agree or disagrees with them and they might want to see if they feel the same way or different. When people want more advice it is because they want the best for them or they want the best others.

Some people might also need more advice because they are confused and they might not know what do in the life and might be worried. Advice from other people can be good or bad because some people will just give a lot of bad advice so life doesn't go good for you some people will give you good advice because they want the best for you. Asking other people for advice can help a human make a really good choice and for a human to go good in life and so that later in life they can have a good idea of what they need to work on.

People will be needing other peoples advice because they don't want to have a bad vision of life because if they do they won't know what life is actually about. Good advice would actually help a lot of people with their health or with their work so they have a really food living environment. Advice will also make you a better person and people might or will accept you like who you are and that is what matters in life and in good advicePeople might also need adviceto have a better mind of what they want to do in their lives and other peoples lives. That is why people seek for more advice from others so they can have a better life and vision of life to.",0
"School brings unforgettable memories. To all students get good grades and have time for their selves is something students want through their life. Many students prefer to stay home and take their classes online. It can make a lot time for student to have for their selves. Also, can affect to learn an important skill in life such how to communicate and have friendships with other people. Although some may believe otherwise, have friends, clubs, and fun flip trips prove that students such consider to attend their school and not be home all the time.

Having friends can make a student learn from each other. For example, I was offered an option to attend classes from home, and through all my elementary school years I spent my time at home study. One day, I decided to have my classes in school with other students. I learned some many things that I have never thought of learning. I got to know new people beside my family. Making friends was of the best things, and I never realizes having friendships is to get to know each other. School is not only a place to learn, but making relationship with other people and learn have to communicated. Some people may believe that friendships can be unhealthy, cause bully, and depression to students. In the other hand, students such not isolated their selves from people, having a friend can make a big different in a students life, and learn how to communicated with one an others.

School have many clubs that student have created to help others. In my school, there are many clubs that help with collecting food, clothes, or supplies to give to the people that need it. Other clubs show new ways to make a better community and help the environment. Me, like a student participated in this activities is something very wonderful. This is a privilege of attend school with others student, we get to come out with ideas to make this world a better place to live. Some may disagree in this ideas, but have a places such like a clubs to get together, and shared opinions about how to make our life more activate in this world. Therefore, student are the future and getting to know each other it can make a different in society.

Get to go to school flip trips and explored new experiences. Almost every school had made a trip for students to have fun and learning something new. It could be a trip to a museum, a park, or historic places. In my life experience, this trips can be very fun. It's better being visiting a place than reading a textbook that related on the topic. Being home school may not give student to participated in this activities with other students. They probably have more time to get out and got to trips. Would this be fun for those student without having the opportunity to spend time with other students, and make a memory that may stay for rest of their life. People would argued about this, but being studying with other students is way to built unforgettable memories. In other words, go in flip trip with other students and spend time together can make student life more happy.

In conclusion, one point in life we look back for those unforgettable memories, and we smile at the special moment, we had. Taking classes from home can be benefit for some students. In my opinion, I disagree in this position because student need to built up friendships, participated clubs, and go out in school flip trips. Spending time with one an others can help student to be better to communicated with others and be more confident to themselves. It get student to be ready to see the world at head of them. ",0
"How does asking others for advice help someone make a better choice?

A while ago, a podcast had been going around asking random people one specific question. The question was if asking others for advice on a problem helps them make better choices. Majority of them said that it does help and most of their reasons were similar. I agree that asking for advice from others helps you make better choices. This can benefit you in the way you make hard choices in many ways. Asking others for advice helps someone make a better choice because you can see the persons perspective on the situation, it gives you more options, and you will not have to face the problem on your own.

When you ask for advice from others, you will be able to see and understand the persons perspective on the situation. Seeing and understanding that persons perspective really does help because you might see the problem differently. It will also probably make you rethink your choice. Almost everyone has a different opinion on a problem. The times we face our own problems, we have our own opinion on it. We may see it as a big problem and others may see it as a small one. Eventually, there will be times when we do not need others people advice.

However, when they explain the way they see the problem, you might see it too. You may not like it, but at least you were able to see things differently and try something new.

There might even be a possibility that you might change the others persons way of making choices. Peoples perspective and opinion can change over time

Asking for peoples opinion can give you more options. It is hard to make a choice when you do not have a fresh idea. This will give you the opportunity to think carefully and choose the best choice. Personally, I think that it is easier when you have more options to choose from. Our choices can sometimes make the problem worse. That is why you need to have an open mind. Having an open mind can lead to a better outcome.

Lastly, this benefits you because you will not have to face the problem by yourself. Most of us think that we need to resolve our problem on our own. It is always better to have people by your side when you need to make a choice. Even if it is just one person, that one person can help a lot more than you think. Also, nothing positive will really come out when you do stuff on your own. There is a certain point where you can not do it alone anymore. We are growing more everyday. Growing up comes with a lot of responsibility and with a lot of new responsibility comes hard choices. You will make mistakes and just will want to give up, but making mistakes leads you closer to success. It will not be easy, but all you need to do is trust in the right people, Later on, you will see that the outcome isbetter than you expected.

In conclusion, asking others for advice helps you make a better choice because you can see the persons perspective on the situation, it gives you more options, and you will not have to face the problem on your own. These are the reasons why I personally believe that asking for advice will help you make better choices. There will be times when you have to make difficult choices and you will not know what to do. You may think that you need to do it own. We will face challenges, but there are people who will be there for you. Asking for help does not make you weak. They will help you in making your choices; they will lead you toward your success. ",0
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" The author thinks that Venus is a worth pursuite despite all of the dangours things that can happen and have had happen. In my own persnal opinion I think it is a horrific idea. Why send people to an unfirmilar plaent when a tiny space craft cant survive. I think even with ihs evdince its a horrinle idea.

In the artical

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."", the author suporrts his idea of

""Venus is a worth pursuite despite all of the dangours"". with facts. In the artical it states ""Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this could-draped world. Each pervious mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Why would someone want to explore a planet that not even a space craft can handel? He also states ""NASA's possible spulution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float aboove the fray."" This is one of the most pathetic pices ideas i have ever heard us. Why send someone where the weather is so harmful it can destroy a robot?

In conclousion I dont think that the author has a valid reason to send human's, his own kind, to a plaent that can kill them witin secinds of being there. He did nothing but support his idea with facts about how dangrous this plaent is to humans. He is living on the edge, it seems as if he does not care that peoples lives will be in extream danger on that planet. With the facts and evdince that i have gathered i think that the author did very porly trying to suppor his idea. ",0
"I believe music, drama, or art class should be classified as electives because some students might not be interested in these classes due to them are wanting to learn more about other subjects, consequently failing; furthermore, students may also have an interest in a certain job and do not need these classes, students can also find these classes a waste of time because they are learning a subject that is not aiding their future, students would also not take these classes serious because they are not necessarily an essential.

First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. Due to the students dissatisfaction and not being interested in the class they have a high probability for failure. For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class.

Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Music, drama, or art can be a waste of time for the student because it is taking time from classes that can help towards getting that job. Taking these classes could also help the student explore more possible job opportunities as well as learning skills.

Lastly, Some students would not take these classes serious. As oppose to essential classes like math, English, and history students would use these classes as an opportunity to horseplay. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects.

In conclusion, I believe music, drama, and art should classify as an elective because students may find that the class is not of interest to them, students can also have an interest in a certain job, and some students would not take these classes serious and take it as an opportunity to horseplay.

I feel that phones should be aloud. Because you never know there could be an emergency or some students just get bored during free time its good that they not bring them out in class but what about lunch connections. There is plenty of time during the day for some students to have out there cell phones. I get that there bad and they take away the attention from the teacher but what about the rest of the day when there is nothing to do or your at lunch even cell phones are not always bad. Some teachers use cell phones during the day why cant students? There would probably be better behavior and less talking during lunch or class because of cell phones. I also think your son has a cell phone out during the day most students do but we have to hide it and we don't want to have to. We should just be aloud to have cell phones i mean its also less stress on the teachers because they don't have to worry about it because we are aloud to have them . Without cell phones most students would be lost or anti social. They also wont use them in class only in free time but also teachers shouldn't be able to use there cell phones if the students cant during class because that is not fair to us. Just because there an adult does not mean there special at all. I also think that there would be less delinquent acts from students at school if you let them use there cell

" Have you ever considered being a part of a school play? I have, and I believe it would be an enjoyable experience. Not only does it allow you to meet new people and work with a team, but it also provides an opportunity to have fun and showcase your talents.

One of the biggest advantages of being in a school play is the opportunity to make new friends. As cast members, it is important to get to know each other and build a strong relationship. This not only helps with rehearsals, but it also creates a positive and supportive environment for everyone involved. Additionally, being in a play can help shy individuals step out of their comfort zone and gain confidence in themselves.

Another benefit of being in a school play is the opportunity to work as a team. Whether it's building sets, creating costumes, or rehearsing lines, working together as a team can be both enjoyable and productive. Not only does it help get more work done, but it also teaches valuable skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.

Finally, the culmination of all the hard work is the performance itself. Being able to share your talents with an audience, whether it's fellow students, teachers, friends, or family, can be a truly rewarding experience. It's a chance to showcase your skills and have fun, all while being a part of something bigger than yourself.

In conclusion, being a part of a school play is an enjoyable and educational experience. It provides the opportunity to meet new people, work as a team, and have fun. Whether you're looking to gain confidence, develop valuable skills, or simply have a good time, being in a school play is definitely worth considering.",1
"The election of a president is a very seriouse thing that could ruin us or improve us we should start to pay attention to Mister State Sentor it could make a future for some people or cause war between people. We should change the system were people can vote for there president not there state electors. Plus, some people don't know this is going on they belive that they are voting for the person to change the state not an candaite of the president.  We should not have people who don't know what there doing in congress and that we don't have segergation in the state.

To start off with, we should not have people we don't know there doing in the congress. In source 2 it states that,'' ... that they can be anyone note holding a public office .... some times state convention ,sometimes the state party's centeral commitee, sometimes the presidental canidates themself'', that is very bad that they can just choose anyone off the streets and don't care, this could be bad for the economy the people thee took off the streets they might not even know how to do there job because they were not trained to do such things, and then they have patry's centeral commitee,or the state convention we should have a direct vote not other people who might not be even on our side and want only power.

Next, we dont want segregation in the state, it casually states that,'' segregationists in te louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in the replacing the democratic electors with new electors that oppose of a Jhon kenndy'', If that have happened then we would be in chaos everyone would be aginst each other and there will be alot of pain and suffering for the people because of there race,and religous belife we would no longer be a great nation.

To conclude my essay, that we should not have strangers we don't know or don't even hold a office in our conress to be a state ellector that don't know what ther doing that is how we end up with alot of wars or no money and that we don't have segergation in the state that can lead into more problems . I just want to end with a qoute that agree with even if you don't ,''the electoral college is unfair , outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly asserations without much basis to start in reality...''.    ",0
"Dear Mr. Florida State Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME in LOCATION_NAME, and I am writing to you addressing a matter that I have witnessed being discussed, come every four years presidential election time: the Electoral College. I am in favor of abolishing the Electoral College and changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The method of electing our president should be changed to election by popular vote because the Electoral College is unfair, problematic, and does not represent the will of our citizens accurately.

First of all, the Electoral College is unfair. Because many states are ""set"" Republican or Democrat, it seems like only the votes in ""swing states"" seem to matter. According to

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong ,""During the 2000 campaign, seveteen states didn't see the candidates at all...and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""So, it seems that, in this system of election, only the swing states matter in voting. Though the focused campaigning is necessary in the process of the Electoral College, it would not be necessary if the voting system was by popular vote. This is unfair because it puts potential voters in the dark about what's going on. Also, Democrats in ""Republican"" states or vice versa cannot hope for them to help their preferred presidential candidate, as mentioned in

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President .

Secondly, the Electoral College is problematic. There is much uncertainty with the Electoral College. As

What Is the Electoral College states, we vote for electors to vote for the President and Vice President. According to

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , ""[The electors]can be anyone not holding public office...sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" The electors may not vote for who the people wanted. An example of this would be in the presidential election of 1960. Also according to

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , ""...segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors.""(paragraph 11) If they had succeded, it would have meant a longer period of intense segregation and racism, which we are still fighting to this day. Another reason that the Electoral College is problematic is in a case of a tie in the electoral vote. Then, more steps are required to figure out who's president.

Lastly, the Electoral College does not represent the citizens of the United States accurately. Many reasons support this claim. I think political parties are similar to ""cliques"" in school. People in cliques act in a certain way, dress in a certain way, only think that how they do things is right, etc. Political parties are similar. If you pick a political party to identify as, you're either ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice"". You're either for something or against something. There's not really an in-between. In

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , author Richard A. Posner says that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""(paragraph 23). Presidential candidates that don't identify with a certain party don't have much of a chance to win at all, even if they might turn out to be what's best for our country. I don't think there should be a vote for ""political preference"", but that's another arguement. Voters should vote for who they want to represent their country with flexible decisions, not a set cookie-cutter description, like a clique in school.

In conclusion, I believe we should abolish the Electoral College and put in place a new system of voting. The process of voting should be changed to the poplular vote because the Electoral College is unfair, uncertainly problematic, and an inaccurate form of representation. We all want what's best for the country, right? So, this is how I think we should make our country better. My voice may not be much, but it only takes one to start a movement. Please consider my voice, and it could be a step to making our country the best it can be.

Sincerely,

"Dear principal,

I heard you are considering changing the school's policy about sports. As you might know I'm not so fond of sports myself, but students do need exercise for their body. I'm not saying they should fail all their grades and be playing sports all the time. All I'm trying to get to is that, this wont change them. Schools need to encourage kids to take part in daily sports right? This wont motivate them at all, now will it? They need to exercise, after all they're still young. Why cancel sports? Which is very healthy for kids. Why not cancel their dances? Now, this will motivate the whole school to get better grades. But, if you do decide to cancel sports for kids with a grade lower than a B, they can find other places to have fun and play sports. So why try to cancel it for them? Good grades, bad grades every child has rights to choose, it's their own decision if they don't want to be a success in their life. My opinion in this situation is, don't make it impossible for kids with bad grades not to be able to play sports. If you do make this change official, kids will just find another way to play sports with their friends. Good or bad, it may be dangerous. Who will be responsible for teenagers playing in the middle of the street? You, by taking away their privileges. Now I'll leave it for you to decide, is it worth the change?",0
"They come in red, blue, green, black, and white. They beep and honk while they ride on highways and transport people form place to place. Cars are everclear. What would the world be like if we didnt have cars? What are the benefits of life without cars? Life with out cars benefits the environment, and peoples' health.

First of all, the elimination of cars helps the environment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" 5. In other words, cars are highly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris, a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after fivedays of intensifying smog"" 14. By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. statistics show that fewer people are using cars around the world. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" 41. Sociologists believe that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They believe it will ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" 34.

Another benefit to limiting car usage is that it will benefit the health of citizens both mentally and physically. In the German suburb of Vauban, citizens have given up their cars. A resident there says ""when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" 3. Limiting car use also limits the frequency of traffic jams, accidents, and unfriendly drivers in a hurry along with the stress and frustration that accompany them. In colombians capital, bogota, the Day Without Cars has had many participants. One of whom said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"" referring to the event. 24 limiting stress can have major benefits to a persons health and mental wellbeing. limiting the use of cars does'nt just positively effect mental health, it can positively influence physical health. In bogota, Colombia, the carfree day inspired residents to ""hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work "" 20. Excersize releases endorphins which are chemicals in the brain related to pleasure. Many people that excersize regularly are happier then when they don't. By limiting car usage,citizens are more inspired to excersize making them happier and healthier.

In sumation, a life without cars means a healthy, longlasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given ""the bird"" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.",0
"Hey, have you heard about the Face on Mars? It's this weird mountain that looks like a face. Some people think that aliens made it, but I don't think so. I think it's just a natural landform.

First of all, let's look at the facts. The Face is made up of a bunch of hills and valleys that, when looked at from a certain angle, form a face. But, it's not a perfect face. It's all squished up and doesn't really look like a face at all. If aliens were gonna make a face, wouldn't they make it look, you know, normal?

And another thing, the Face is huge! It's like a mile long and a half mile wide. That's way too big for any alien to make. I mean, imagine how long it would take to build something that big! And why would aliens even bother making a face on Mars? It's not like they're trying to communicate with us or anything.

Now, let's talk about the evidence. The article we read said that the Face was formed by erosion and weathering. That makes sense, 'cause Mars has a really thin atmosphere, so the wind and rain can't do much to change the landscape. And, the article said that the Face is made up of really soft rock, so it's easy for the wind and rain to erode it. That's why it looks so weird and squished up.

Also, the article said that there are other faces on Mars that are similar to the one we're talking about. They're not as big, but they're still pretty weird looking. So, if aliens were making faces on Mars, wouldn't they make them all the same? Why would they make some big and some small? It doesn't make sense.

Finally, let's think about the odds. There are billions of planets in the universe, and we're the only ones who think the Face on Mars looks like a face. It's probably just a coincidence. And, even if aliens did exist, why would they choose to make a face on Mars and not, like, a statue or something?

So, all things considered, I think the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It's not some alien's art project or anything. It's just a weird looking mountain that we happened to notice. We shouldn't jump to conclusions just 'cause something looks a little weird. We gotta think about the facts and the evidence before we start saying stuff like, ""Oh, aliens did it!""

Anyway, that's my argument. I hope you agree with me now!",1
"Think about a time in your life when you've been assigned a project to do over summer, and think about how much of a learning experience it was, and where you could have improved. There are many schools that require students to complete summer projects during their break. The reason they do this is to assure that their students continue to learn new information throughout their summers. Implementing summer projects, however, inevitably raises the question, should student projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Teachers should grant students a possible selection between multiple topics, and have guidelines as to what each student's project should include, so students would be able to pick and choose which topic they'd like to complete, and the way they'd like to complete their project in order to meet the mandatory guidelines instructed by their teacher, to give students real life skills, to enforce learning even more, and to give students the ability to choose a project that fits their own schedule over break.

Firstly, one reason teachers should give a selection of topics with mandatory guidelines and have students decide which one they'd like to complete is because this would prepare students in an effective way for their futures. A big responsibility of schools is to prepare their students for the future. Every student should be granted a positive learning environment that enforces learning, as well as preparing its students for college, and life in the real world. In giving students the selection of topics to choose from, it would teach students how to be responsible, because it would be up to them to decide which project they're going to do, and how they'd get it done. It'd also give students a sense independence. By assigning projects in this way, students aren't being hand held through every step, and they're going to have to do some things on their own, like deciding which project to do. This also gives students the opportunity to think for themselves, and it teaches them advocacy, as they make the decision to do their project their own way.

Secondly, another reason teachers should give students a selection of topics with guidelines that they can chose from is because it would enforce learning even more. As a student, being given a problem that they're told to solve does enforce learning. However, being told to create a problem themselves is much more challenging, as it causes the student to deeply process the way the problem is structured, and what their next step would be in creating a problem. Similarly, being told to do their own project may be challenging, but the one instruction that would be even more challenging is asking students to create their own project from a selection of topics. The process students will go through in creating their own project will take much deeper encoding of the information given, and this will ensure that they continue learning during their breaks.

Finally, the last reason students should be given a selection of possible topics and guidelines that they can choose from is that they can do a project tailored to what they have planned during break. Too many times, teachers fail to acknowledge the fact that students have different plans over their breaks, and every student has a life outside of school, especially over their summer breaks. Therefore, if students are given a selection of topics they can do their project on, they can choose from whichever one that fits their plans accordingly. For example, if one student is going on a trip to the tropical rain forests, and they notice that one of their project topic choices is on the different leaves of the tropical rain forest environments, they can choose this choice. To contrast, if a student isn't planning on leaving their house much over the summer, then they can choose a topic that has to do with particulate matter in the closed atmosphere. Giving students a choice of topics allows them to make the decision that best fits their schedule, and provides an enjoyable learning experience during their summer breaks.

To counter this position, one might claim that students who are given too much freedom by allowing them to create their own project will only lead to students submitting sloppy, unsatisfactory work. Whereas, students given a fixed project that every student has to complete over their break means that students can't shortcut their way around putting in the work to create a decent project, and will have more positive results. However, enforcing mandatory guidelines that every student must meet ensures that students will have structure in their projects while maintaining the individuality that comes with creating their own projects. As a result, students won't be able to cheat off of one another, or try to copy others' work, because every project should be unique, as long as it's meeting the set guidelines.

To conclude, learning is a concept that has adapted throughout the years, and is still changing every day. We must be conscious of these changes, and the process of teaching students needs to grow and change with it, because the same procedures that worked best in the past aren't necessarily the best teaching methods of the present, or the future. It is a school's responsibility to create a positive learning environment that instills learning in the best possible way for its students, to prepare its students for the real world, and to equip its students with all the necessary tools and skills they need to survive and thrive as the next future leaders of the world. This being said, schools should assign summer projects where teachers give a selection of the possible topics a student can choose from with mandatory guidelines to equip students with effective skills, to enforce learning in a more effective method, and to give students the ability to choose a project that best fits their own shcedules over their breaks. ",0
"Dear School Principal,

In many schools, cell phones can be a big problem. Teachers catch students texting instead of paying attention in class and constantly have to tell them to keep their phones turned off or take them away. Many administrators ban cell phones from school, as suggested by Policy 2, for fear of students texting answers to each other for tests and distracting them from their lessons. While this may seem like a appealing idea in many ways, students need cell phones at school for important reasons besides talking to their friends.

A lot of students participate in extracurricular activities after school. Activities such as sports, clubs, and performing arts practice after school and students have to arrange for a ride home. Students need to have cell phones at school in order to contact their ride to tell them where to pick them up, if there is a time change or practice is cancelled. After school is over most schools are locked or students are unable to reach school phones.

Cell phones are needed to make contact with a student's ride and make sure they arrive home safely.

Another reason students need cell phones at school is to make sure they have all of their supplies for the day. Say you forgot your science project at home. You could use your cell phone to call your parents or a neighbor to ask them to drop it off at school.

You may also need to schedule a meeting after school for a study group or project.

You could use your cell phone to contact the group members, schedule a meeting place and make sure they know what to bring. Having a cell phone can help students be prepared for learning and improve their study skills.

Allowing students to have their cell phones at school is an important part of their safety and enhances their learning ability. Unfortunately, they can be distracting, which is why

Policy 1 would be the best choice. With the phones turned off during class time, students could stay focused on the lesson, but still be able contact friends or family if they need to.

Sincerely,

An 8th grade student      ",0
"Dear Principal

The Police i think is correct is Policy 1. I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch.

I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time I don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school.

If we put policy number 2 at school it wouldn't make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time. So I think that school are a problem while using it in class but I think that is not bad to use it during lunch time or free time.",0
"If there was an option to ether run into a burning building or stay outside where it is safe, what would most people choose? For many students school is a burning building; it only brings them uncomfort and harm. There are many uncomforts experienced by students, for example, school is put at a set time with distinct locations for every class and specific times for all work to be done. This inflicts stress and no motivation to some students, therefore, if a class is taken at home the student would no longer feel this way, instead they would feel motivated and more prepared to do their work due to the flexibility and comfort of their own home. Students should be able to take classes from home because it provides a comforting environment, flexibility for class time and work, and a safe place without stress.

One of the biggest issues with in-school classes is the specific timing for each lesson, because of this many students must complete piled up work if they ever miss a day. Some kids may not be able to come to school due to problems at home, lack of transportation, financial problems, etc., but by having classes from home they will not need to worry about these issues, instead they will be able to focus of their school work. This also helps their parents. In a typical high school, there is a time in the middle of the day for lunch which includes students needing money to buy food, many parents cannot afford to pay the large amount of money needed for lunch accounts, therefore, the child is left hungry. With online classes however, parents feel comfortable knowing their child is at home where they are able to provide them with food. This also helps kids who are affected or stressed about family or home problems. By eliminating the need of going to school, the extra stress is also eliminated. Issues of attendance are also brought down. During holidays, breaks, vacations, and absences, students are unable to come to school since they are no longer in the area or must attend to some other important business, with in-school classes, students are stressed that they must catch up on missed work upon their return. With online classes they are able to take their work with them wherever they are and are able to learn with flexibility.

Along with being a stressful environment, school inflicts students with unsafe and self contious feelings. Many students undergo the troubles of bulling or judgment in high school which makes them feel contious and insecure, however, by being able to take classes from home, students are able to learn without the fear of being attacked. Bulling has caused many critical problems throughout school all over the world, children suffer from depression, feel the need to inflict harm upon themselves or others, and in some instances, cause devastating events such as school shootings. These tragedies are what make students throughout the nation feel unsafe and threatened. Online classes allow students who feel this way the opportunity to learn in an environment comfortable to them making the education process much more successful. Many students also suffer from mental and/or physical disabilities making learning and the environment of school overwhelming for them. By having the ability to take classes at home both the student as well as their parents would feel safer and more comfortable during the learning process. This can also go for students that have suffered an injury and have trouble moving from class to class, by taking a class online they have the ability to stay home without the stress of traveling between classes or missing assignments during resting periods.

Online classes may cause some minor problems for kids as well. For example, having online classes can be beneficial to many students, however, it depletes them of social and environmental interactions since they will not be exposed to outside interactions. This can be bad for a student because it can limit the number of friend or people introduced to them, however, online classes may also allow the ability of going to other activities due to the flexibility of class time. These other activities can consist of a students interests allowing them to meet others with similar hobbies or experiences. Another problem is the flexibility and restraint when it comes to where or when students must be while taking the class, this can result is the possibility of students slacking or avoiding their work. By avoiding their work they will not get sufficient educational material and cause them to miss critical information for that class, however, this issue can also be avoided if the class requires documents or homework to be submitted for a grade.

Many adults choose to work from home and continue their job in a relaxed environment where they do not have to travel to work, dress up, or stay in an area that does not motivate them. Students should be able to do the same. They are told to be at school at a specific time with an enforced dress code and judgmental people surrounding them everywhere they go with no regard to possible personal problems. By allowing online classes, students only have to worry about their education instead of the impressions others have of them. Solutions to problems such as bulling, self dought, unnecessary stress, and uncomfort are all avoided. If the benefits outweigh the conflicts, it is the better option.",0
"There have only been a few spacecrafts sent to Venus but none of them lasted long scientist are trying to figure out how to get a spacecraft to hover over the surface. The reason is to collect samples from there and then be able to make it back or have enough time to send the information the spacecraft got, back to NASA.

For example "" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcaneos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"". We are having trouble getting the data back because the spacecraft it is getting destroyed.

It may be very expensive to attempt to get to Venus but it could give us some good insight on what we can research and study back at Earth. The stuff we find on Venus could be benefical to us going to different planets and exploring different parts of the Solar System.

In conclusion we shouldn't let money be a factor on if we get a spacecraft to Venus we just have to figure out how to safely get there and be able to gather the data from the spacecraft. If we do find something we will most likely go back and try to find more of it or more helpful resources. ",0
"Desperately stuck not knowing what to do or what to choose, but you have no idea who to ask for help? People many times dont know who the right person to take advice from is, but there is more than one person that can assist you with what you need. When asking for advice, talking to multiple people is a good choice, because people have experienced things differently from one another. It also allows you to hear from both sides of the story so you can get a clear picture of what you should do.

People experience things in different ways, so getting advice from different people will give you a clearer picture of what you need to do. For example lets say somebody wanted to practice for the English writing SOL, lets call this student Generic_Name. To be prepared for the SOL, Generic_Name asked his friend for advice on what he should study the most. Since everybody struggles on different things, and also gets different prompts, Generic_Name wouldn't have practiced as efficiently as he could have. Now if he had asked multiple people, including other students in his English class, and his English teacher he would have been more prepared to study, and ready to take the test. This is why when asking for advice you should take in consideration multiple people's opinions, so you have a better idea of what you need to do.

When you are stuck making a difficult choice that is subjective, or you just do not know the whole story, getting advice from multiple sources can help you make a more educated choice. Take Generic_Name Jr. for example, his friends just had a fight and he dosn't know how he should react because he was not there when the fight broke out. To know whose side he should take, Generic_Name Jr. asked another student that had seen what had happened to help him. The problem is, that the student that he asked to help him figure out what had happened, already disliked one of the kids that was involved in the argument, and was biased. Because of this Generic_Name Jr. made the wrong decision. If he had asked other witnesses, or even the actual kids that had participated in the argument, Generic_Name would have made a smarter choice. Thats why when you are getting help you need to make sure that the advise that the person is giving you is not too biased, or else you could make a wrong decision.

If you are asking for advise, it is always a good idea to talk to more than one person because then you can get to hear from both sides of the story, and different people experience things in different ways so you can get a broader view of something. Getting help from different people makes your choice more objective in a difficult decision. Asking more people for advice will help you make a more educated answer on a topic, and will help realize what you should do. So, if you are in a situation were there are a lot of people that can give you advise, why would you ever want to end up like Generic_Name, and not ask for it.    ",0
"I think we should have computers that read emotions so it could keep us on track and make students wanna learn and help us focus on our work inanclass room its an good thing to technology.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Hauang predicts . then it could modify the lesson , like an effctive human instructor."" the same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive . this would make students wanna learn more because some times students get bored looking at the same thing on an computer for long periods of time but if there was an computer that reads your emotions and could fix how we learn it would make us want to learn more and keep us from not being bored while on the computer you will want to get your work done and not wanna go to sleep in class .",0
"Dear Principal,

I don't think its right to require all students to perform community service. Some students live in dangerous areas where its unsafe to go outside. Others may not be able to work due to how late their parents get back from work or it may interfere with doing homework. Some students won't do any work because their's no incentive to work other than you telling them to.

You should take safety as a big reason not to require students doing work for community. In the day and age we live in there are too many things that could harm somebody.

There are sexual predators, gangs, serial killers, and kidnappers. If a student is in a gang and is out doing a group community project and a rival gang member sees that student everybody else could be in danger of a drive by shooting and multiple people could be seriously injured or even killed. With the numbers of gangs rising in the U.S. there's no telling who could be in a gang or not. Sexual predators is also a major concern. When you have a couple of teenagers on the side of the road cleaning it would be easy to kidnap someone and rive off.

Another reason why you shouldn't require students to work is because some parents don't get home till really late at night. Usually by the time my mom and step dad get home its already dark outside and to late to do anything. Working after school would be the main time students would have to work and after school is when students are doing their homework. Even if your doing your community a good thing having students grades drop doesn't look good on the school.

I know a lot of kids who wouldn't work even if they were forced to. If all you do is simply tell all the students they have to do community service then very few people will want to work. Even if you bring in rewards for working some kids would say, "" Woo a bike! My birthday is in a month I can wait."" On top of not wanting to work they have leadership classes that are solely based on doing good things for the community for those who want to.

All of these reasons are why you shouldn't require students to do community service.

"In this essay I will be talking about the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" The face was not created by aliens it is a natural landform. I have a lot of evidence for my claim.

They all prove that it is a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

It was not created by aliens.

Here is some evidence. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" Another piece of evidence is it was describes as a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

Last but not least I have one more piece of evidence ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" They thought is was made by aliens because they usually don't see this face. Now that they know it is a natural landform they will always see it.

In conclusion we can prove that the Face in Mars is just a natural landform.

At the beginning everyone thought that aliens made this. ""It has been shown in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" All of this evidence proves that it was just a natural landform no one ever noticed. ",0
"When humans need help on a problem they can't get around by themselves, they ask for help in the form of advice. And this happens to almost everybody. That one time you had an argument with your best friend so you asked your mom what to do, that was advice. And that other time when you wanted to join the football team but had no idea how so you asked your athletic friend Generic_Name, that was also advice. But have you ever asked multiple people for advice on the same thing? This is actually beneficial because it can help you make a better choice on the problem you are facing. Seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice because it shows different points of views and the person can choose which advice is the most optimal for the problem they are facing.

Seeking out multiple opinions on a problem you are facing can help show different viewpoints of the problem. Everybody is different in the world. We've heard it preached throughout our lives. And asking for advice just proves that more. All over the world each person is experiencing something different, it may be a small difference in reality but the each mind processes it differently. That's why asking multiple people is important. A 14 year-old who went to the nationals in robotics team is going to have a different opinion than an adult who goes to Harvard for engineering. It doesn't mean that one is more important than the other, but it does effect the advice they give. Age is another variable that changes viewpoint. Your grandfather is going to have a different opinion than your friend in high school because of the times they each grew up in. Because everyone has so many different experiences and mindsets, the person asking for advice is going to have to choose which one is the best or even combine some of the them to make the best or most optimal advice for their problem.

Asking for multiple opinions can help the person asking by giving them options to make the most optimal choice needed for the problem they are facing. The best thing about asking multiple people for advice is that you have options. Options to choose from or even combine to make the best choice. You can compare the opinions you got and see which is the best fit for your problem. And if multiple opinions are the same, most likely that is the best option. But opinions can also contradict each other since everyone has a different viewpoint and ideas. So the only thing you can do is choose which is the best. Only you know what strengths and weaknesses you have. It's your problem that you are facing, and only you know what the best option is.

So now you have chosen the best option for you. You beat the problem you where facing with ease because of the help you've gotten. Now your shoulders feel infinitely lighter as you breathe a sigh of relief. The problem which you've had so much trouble with is now gone. The different viewpoints of others and the options you had helped make the best choice for you. And now you realize that seeking multiple opinions on a problem that you are facing isn't such a bad thing and is in fact a great help.",0
"If you could, would you want to live on a different planet? Well according to the author, studying a different planet such as Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports his or her idea well and has many examples to back himself up. The author talks about the similarites Venus has to Earth, the dangers of Venus, and what scientists are doing to make going to Venus a possibility.

Despite the dangers of studing Venus, there are many reasons why it is a worthy pursuit. The author states in the article,""Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This shows that even though Venus is dangerous, there are similarites that make it worth while to study, if that means one day having another planet similar to Earth.

In the article, there are many dangers of Venus. According to the text, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This shows the challenges of studying Venus because the percent of carbon dioxide and high corrosive sulfuric acid are too much for humans or even some spacecrafts. Another danger is the temperature. Venus averages a surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That is beyond temperatures at which we humans can withstand. To show the severity of the atmospheric pressure, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" These dangers may seem like it isn't a worthy pursuit but the author goes on to describe just why and how scientist should pursue Venus. The article states that long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. To add on to that, today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. This is a good example to support that the author supports his or her claim because it is describing what was and is still good about Venus. The top example that supports the authors claim is what the scientists have already done to begin the search of Venus. According to the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" This supports the author's claim because despite the dangers of Venus, the scientists have found a way to study Venus at a more suitable, safer way. Maybe not as efficient, but it saves the lives of the astronaunts.

In conclusion, the author supports his or her claim well because of all the evidence and examples that are used in the text. Stating the similarites of Earth show that it is worth while to study Venus when the outcome could possibly be a planet that is like a second Earth. Describing the dangers of Venus but then talking about how the scientists can get around those dangers supports the author's claim because the readers see that even though Venus is dangerous, there are still valuable ways to study it, meaning that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.",0
"In this generation everyone has a phone. I got my first phone when I was in 8th grade and since then I've just been on it probably 24/7.

When I got old enough my parents were really scared in letting me drive because they really thought I was going to text and drive. And the only fault that I could point to is this generation. There are 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. I promise you if you go outside right now you will see at least one out of every 2 cars texting and driving. Teenagers just think it's cool until sadly they learn the hard way.

To start everything, I just would like to say that I do not agree with texting and driving. Teenagers driving and texting literally, leads to nothing good. With us being teenage drivers, we are automatically easily distracted. Now imagine how our bodies react when we hear that ""ding"" that we get a message from a boyfriend / girlfriend. Your body just reacts in a way I can't describe and it's like you HAVE to answer. Then with you answering you get distracted and that means you're not paying attention to the road and/or your surroundings. And the rest isn't anything pretty to talk about.

What happens next isn't anything pretty to talk about. Like I said in my first paragraph nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from texting and driving. I've personally witness several accidents on my way to work. Some are worse than others but still, regardless of how ""big or small"" the accident is, ITS still an accident. Then in that spilt second you think to yourself and ask if that text was really truly worth it. There's a quote that I always remember when it comes to texting and driving, "" it can wait"" think about it , what would of happened if you did wait to text back? Maybe there would have been no accident, I guess no one will ever know because YOU chose to answer that text.

My final thought in this essay, is my personal experience. One day I was coming home from work and I was texting my girlfriend and I blinked and within that second I got into a car accident. I've never felt my heart beat that fast before, I was extremely scared in thinking if he was okay and if I was going to get my butt whooped. My other experience is my 3 friends who passed away last year. They were speeding along with some texting and sadly they all passed away. it was a very tragic year, leaning to live without them. And that's why I got all 3 of them tattooed on me. A reminder that im not suppose to text and drive.

That will conclude my essay but like I said , I DO NOT support texting and driving. Even blasting music and driving. Some people just don't understand that driving is not a game. Its something serious and with your actions you can ether kill someone or prevent from killing someone.      ",0
"The debate surrounding the issue of cellphones in school is complex. On one hand, providing students with the opportunity to have a cellphone in school could enhance trust and communication between parents and teachers, and could also enable students to keep up with their work and contact each other quickly. On the other hand, the presence of cellphones in school could be a huge distraction from learning, as students can become easily engrossed in their devices instead of focusing on their education. Other concerns include potential violations of rules and the possibility of cyberbullying.

"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME, and i would like to tell you about how i feel on your new policy for sports and curriculum .

Well many people including me have a C average as our grade. But that doesn't mean you should punish us. We very well could be failing but were trying our very hardest to not be. Many things in the curriculum are very difficult for us to grasp, and understand, but that doesn't mean we aren't trying our very hardest to get our grades up. now this is not the case for every student, but in my case it is. I am having a great deal of difficulty in math right now, and that's because we are covering an area of material that I don't fully understand. I keep trying harder and harder everyday but the formulas and numbers just don't add to me. But I have had a great grade in this class all year until we got onto this subject. Many kids struggle with a subject that is difficult for them to learn. But we shouldn't punish them for it, just because they don't understand. Now I can understand why you would change the policy for people who don't care about they're grade's and don't care to keep them up. But for the kids that do care they're just not getting the material that we are learning, why should they be punished to. Maybe being in a sport will help them learn that, if they want to stay on the sport then they have to keep they're grade's up. Also if you change the policy many students will have to leave the sport they love, and you will have not very big teams and the school would lose a lot of money. Now I'm not asking you to lower the policy of the grade average but all I'm saying is, us students try our hardest everyday to do our best, But sometimes our best isn't good enough. But why should we get punished just because we had a rough or an off week. maybe sports will help the students mature and learn that they have to keep they're grade up if they want to stay with the sport they love.

So please Principal TEACHER_NAME, please reconsider changing your policy of our grade average. I think that if the policy stays the same then the students, you, the school, and the district will benefit from our curriculum and sport life. So thank you for taking the time out to read my letter and I hope you think about reconsidering, I promise you and others will benefit from leaving the policy the way it is. Thank you again.

sincerely,

"Why does everybody suspect that their is life on Mars when they see a wierd form of rock on it when really it´s nothing like that? Well thats how a lot of people were thinking when NASA revealed the picture of the Face on Mars. However thats not true. NASA has proven in so many ways that it´s just a natural landform, but of course some people think that it´s not natural at all.

First, NASA was very suprised to see something like that on the camera of Viking 1 spacecraft. But that went away really fast. ¨Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows made it like an Egyptian Pharaoh.¨(2) This tells you that it´s just a natural landform. Not a alien artifact .

Also, NASA wanted to go see if it´s a artifact or just a natural lanform. ¨Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.¨(7) This tells you that they never found an alien artifact on April 5,1998. All they found was a natural landform on Mars.

Finally, since not everyone was convinced that it was a natural landform, NASA decided to go back and get an even clearer picture of the Martian mesa. This time they used an even stronger camera to show the world that NASA is right.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,¨ he added. ¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!¨(11) This can tell you that NASA was trying to tell everyone that their cameras are good enough to spot and see if it´s just a natural landform, so now you shouldn´t be complaning about the pictures.

All of this evidence can tell you that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform, not a alien artifact. Their are still a lot of people who think that martians do exist and they will think anything that is not normal on Mars is martian. However there is no martians on Mars. What do you think?

"One of the key reasons why many countries and places are reducing their usage of cars is the increasing awareness of the negative impact of car emissions on air quality and the environment. The rising levels of smog and pollution have been linked to respiratory problems, global warming, and other detrimental effects on human health and the planet as a whole.

By implementing measures such as carfree zones, car bans, and dedicated carfree days, cities and countries are taking steps towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. These initiatives not only aim to reduce air pollution but also promote alternative modes of transportation like walking, cycling, and public transit.

In addition to the environmental benefits, these efforts have also led to improvements in the quality of life for residents. For example, in Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is discouraged, people have found joy in the sounds of bicycle tires and the laughter of children, resonating through the streets. The absence of cars has created a quieter and more peaceful atmosphere, fostering a sense of community and enhancing overall well-being.

Germany, as a whole, has been at the forefront of these endeavors, striving to create compact suburbs and making public transport more accessible. This shift towards carless suburbs not only reduces air pollution but also promotes healthier and more active lifestyles among residents.

However, it is important to acknowledge that not all areas are ready or willing to embrace this carless lifestyle. Some places still cling to the idea of large suburban areas with private garages and spread-out homes. These traditional notions of the American dream, characterized by car-centric lifestyles, continue to persist in certain regions. Nevertheless, the success stories from places like Vauban and Paris demonstrate that the tide is slowly turning towards a more sustainable and car-independent future.

Paris, for instance, enforced a partial driving ban to combat its severe smog problem. This measure led to a significant reduction in traffic congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. While there were some drawbacks, such as delivery companies facing revenue losses, the overall benefits outweighed the temporary inconveniences. In fact, public transit became free during the experimental period, encouraging people to explore alternative modes of transportation.

Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, has taken a proactive stance in tackling pollution through its annual carfree day. This event has not only succeeded in reducing smog levels but has also inspired other Colombian cities to follow suit. This proves that collective efforts to promote alternative transportation methods can have a profound impact and foster a sense of environmental responsibility among citizens.

In the United States, there has been a noticeable decline in car ownership and driving due to various factors. The recession of the late 2000s severely impacted people's purchasing power, making new vehicles unaffordable for many. Additionally, changing attitudes towards sustainability and the availability of alternative transportation options have further contributed to a decrease in car usage. Major automotive companies like Ford and Mercedes have recognized this shift in consumer preferences and are adapting their strategies to meet changing demands.

The fight against pollution and efforts to reduce car usage are not isolated occurrences but part of a global movement towards a more sustainable future. Countries and cities are taking a proactive stance against pollution and advocating for cleaner modes of transportation. These initiatives are not only improving air quality but also creating healthier and happier communities.

However, there is still a long way to go. Governments, urban planners, and individuals must continue to support and implement sustainable transportation policies and infrastructure to enable a smooth transition towards a carless future. Through collective action and a collective shift in mindset, we can achieve a significant reduction in pollution, improve public health, and create a more sustainable world for future generations.",1
"In American society today- and other countries also- it's safe to say that only a little bit more than half of teengers are wanting to get their driver's liscense. It is the same way with adults too. More people are choosing to move to smaller communities where shopping centers and restaraunts are a walking distance away. At first, it was all about just following the trend or a new law. Now people are realizing that not driving everywhere is benificial in more than one way.

In Europe, this trend is growing rapidly and has been for a few years now. Countries like Germany, Frace and Switzerland are examples of where a large percentage of their population don't drive cars. In Vauban, Germany it is against the law to park anywhere except for parking garages and if the car-owner purchases their own parking space, with a home also, for $40,000. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P3). Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from 12% of car-owners in Europe. With less cars, it is said there the city has a less tense and/or stressful vibe to it, and the pollution level has decreased dramatically.

In America, the love for cars is not as strong anymore either. In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995, and 23% of people weren't driving between the years of 2001-2009. ""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communites, and legislators are are starting to act, if cautiously."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P9). Though reducing the amount of cars being driven has a positive impact on the environment, it will have a negative impact on car indistries across the U.S.

Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have prooved that having less car-owners has decreased pollution levels. In Bogota, there is a Day Without Cars where only public transportation is allowed. Citizens will suffer a $25 fine if they are driving their own car. Paris, France temporarilly banned driving, and if they were found driving a 22-euro fine was charged. Both countries saw immediate results in the ammount of smog in theit cities.

It is obvious that not owning a car or choosing to walk more than driving has effected places like Europe, America and South America in a positive way. As more people realize that limiting car usage is good for the environment and benificial to their everyday lives, less people will be driving and the world will slowly see start to see a change.

"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about how playing sports can have super cool benefits for our goals, both in the short and long term. Like, I know some people might think sports are just about running around and having fun, but they're actually way more than that! 🤯

So, first off, sports can help us reach our goals in the short term. Like, if you're trying to get better at soccer, playing on a team can help you practice your skills and learn new ones. You can work with your teammates to figure out how to pass the ball better or how to score more goals. And the more you practice, the better you'll get! 🏆 It's like, the more you put in the effort, the more you'll get out of it.

But sports don't just help us reach our goals in a direct way. They also teach us super important skills that we can use in other areas of life. Like, teamwork! 🤝 Sports teach us how to work together towards a common goal, which is super important in life. Whether it's in school or in our careers, being able to work with others is key to success. And sports show us how to do that in a fun and competitive way! 🏈

And here's the thing, teamwork isn't just about working together, it's also about supporting each other. When one of your teammates is having a tough game, you can help them out by giving them a pep talk or cheering them on. And when you're having a tough game, your teammates can help you out too! 🤝 It's like, we're all in this together, and we can all help each other reach our goals.

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what about the competition? Don't sports teach us to be competitive and win at all costs?"" And yeah, sometimes sports can be competitive, but they also teach us how to be gracious winners and losers. Like, if you win, you don't get cocky and think you're better than everyone",1
"I think that the students should be able to be in sport or other activities with a C average to start with. If they show that they are committed to the activities then the grade level should go up to a B average. If the students have something to do that they really like they will put there all into it. If the activities starts to pick up then the standards should be higher for the school work and grades. If they really care about the activities then they will make sure there school work is good. So they can stay in the sport or activity they are in . If there grades go down they should be cut out of the sport or club they are in. Until they get there grades back up to at least a C average then up to a B average.

The students will like that because it will give them something to do after school. Instead of being at home bored. They can have a sport or club activity to give them the chance to meet new friends and to stay out of trouble. Maybe before they go to there sport or activity they can sit down and do there homework . So the teachers know that the students are getting there work done. If no one has home work then they can sit down and read for about 15 minutes. To let them know that school work is more important than anything. I Think that would be a good way to compromise the situation.",0
"According to the author

''To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is a greatest accomplishment '', is hard because we are in one world that the most important thing is the appearances more than what you are, most of the people prefer be and appears something that they can not be, for example most of the people when someone comment about how they look or how they are, some of them get frustrated, is a biggest accomplishment because they critic your form of walk, how you use your clothes and how you do the things.

We lives in one world that the opinions are more important or what others thinks about you, are more important because the constantly opinions from people that the only things they care about is their appearances, one of the first reason why is a biggest accomplishment try to be yourself and be individuality is that you need to appear how you are, do your own stuff, no matter what the opinions are.

I am agree with the author of this prompt because is true that is a biggest accomplishment that everyday we have to tried to completed and do not do what others want you to do to make them feel better, or just do it for appear something that you are not, is good to be individuality and do your things by yourself and do not get influence with bad comments or opinions from others that are not satisficate with their personalities but is not easier to be strong in the world where the appearances has a big influences in the community.

In Conclusion, not everything is easy, when people do not try to let the stereotypes when is talking about how to be yourself, and leave others decided for you or left them influences you with negative thoughts, those people are not better enough to stay in your life, is a greatest accomplishment to dissolve but nothing is impossible and believe in yourself individuality and do the rights things can help you to finish the thoughts about others people with try to change everything.",0
"I agree with the principal, because doing an extracurricular actives can benefit kids in many ways. One way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is by playing a sport it can teach them many things. Another way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is join a student council is can teach kids how to use their voice. Last way is join any club.

A way join a sport could benefit kids is it can show kids what its like to be on a team. That can help them to get a job or if they already have one it can help them during their job. Another way playing a sport can benefit kids it can teach them how to work on a team and how to work well with others.

Another way how extracurricular act ivies could benefit kids is serving on student council it can help kids speak up or fight for what's or to make things equal. That can benefit kids in many ways, such as if while working a job you think something is not be treated right or if someone is not being treated equally you can speak up for what's right.

Last way joing an extracurricular activity could benfit kids is by joing a a club. Joing a club could help them interact with more people. Learning how to interact with people can help kids later on life, during a job, in school, or even in public.

In concluison joining an extracurricualr activity could help kids in many more ways then the ones sated above. Playing a sport could benfit kids by teaching them how to work togeter. Serving on a student conciual could help kids use their voice and fight for whats right. Last way is by joing a club it could help kids interact with people. You should join an extracurricular to see what could happen.",0
"The primary goal of any school is for their students to do the best they possibly can throughout their years of education; However, many students around the globe do not thrive in a traditional school environment and opt for an alternate form of learning such as homeschooling. In addition to homeschooling, distance learning is an option that various schools offer in which students are able to attend their classes at home via online courses or video conferencing in place of going to school. While there are many parents, teachers, and administrators that say distance learning is not a suitable way for students to learn, others could argue that distance learning is an innovative solution that not only increases the responsibility of a student, but also accommodates personal situations a student is going through. Overall, the ability to attend classes from home would be beneficial to many students due to the increase of independence, lack of distractions, and flexibility it provides.

As a student gets older, the amount they are responsible for increases in order to prepare them for their adult lives. Allowing students to take their classes online would only aid in teaching a student to become more responsible by enabling them to make their own decision on whether to open their laptop and attend class or not. This also gives students the opportunity to plan their own schedules more freely because they are not limited to attending class in a school classroom for seven hours of the day. Instead they are able to take their class while traveling or perhaps, in between classes they are able to complete errands and become much more productive. While many adults would believe that students would simply just decide to skip class and go on with their day, allowing them to take online classes would in fact promote responsibility and productivity within the student.

What goes on in a students life could have a large impact on their school performance. When an injured student is attending school, moving from class to class can prove to be very difficult and could also cause them discomfort. Taking classes online would allow the student to heal in the comfort of their home while still being able to obtain the learning material as if they were in school. This could also indicate that online learning does not have to be a permanent solution for all students. Along with being a solution for physically injured students, this could be very beneficial for student athletes who have suffered a concussion. The harsh lighting and loud hallways are factors that are proven to irritate a concussed student, therefore by allowing them to take their classes at home once they are cleared for instruction, they are able to focus on their classwork without risk of feeling sick due to the commotion of a classroom. It could be argued that disrupting a students daily schedule in this manner could cause more harm than good but by allowing students to take their classes online when injured, it allows them to heal with minimal discomfort while missing no class instruction.

It is proven that students learn in different ways, many students get very distracted by the aspects of a traditional classroom, such as harsh lighting, disruptive classmates, and the loud bell signaling for a class change. Attending class online eliminates those distractions by placing the student in a comfortable environment in which they would learn best. Adults could argue the fact that a student's home could open the opportunity for more distractions, the location where a student takes their class does not have to be their home. While many students find their home to be the most suitable place to take their classes, some students could prefer a public library or coffee shop. The ability of taking classes online also means that if their usual location is not ideal one day, they can easily move to a different location to help aid their focus. Online learning allows students to place themselves in the best location for them to achieve their work.

To conclude, the topic of allowing students to take their classes online is very controversial. While it may not be suitable for all students, online classes would benefit many students by allowing them to grow more independently. It would also make learning much more flexible to the student and eliminate typical distractions that you would find in the classroom. The ability to attend classes from home would be beneficial to many students due to the increase of responsibility, lack of distractions, and flexibility it provides.        ",0
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during their break. With students having a project to do during their break, it might help them not lose knowledge of what they have learned over the school year. One problem is that with the project being designed by the teacher students might not have motivation or be willing to do the project, or if the project that has been designed by the teacher is not interesting the students might not be willing to do the assignment. With the schools having students require to do summer projects during their break, the project should be student designed, not by teachers.

First, letting students design their own projects will give them the opportunity to do something that interests them. Therefore, this will make the students want to be able to their project and in the process of making it, they might find it fun to do. With the students being able to design their project and finding something that interests them it will make them put more effort into the project. Most importantly this will keep them learning throughout their break and more eager to do their projects.

Additionally, throughout the school year teachers have designed tests, quizzes, and projects to students but unfortunately there are some who tends to find it boring and not do it. But with letting them choose what they want to do for their project, this project could help with their grade. The students putting effort and time into their own choice of what they want to do might make that task easier for them. Then after they have done their project knowing that they put effort into what they are doing, they will have the satisfaction of completing it than just not doing it because the project designed by the teacher doesn,t interest them.

Some may say, that students shouldn,t be able to design their own project and let the teacher do it because thats how it should be. However, that has been the problem of education and why some students fail their classes because they aren,t given the option of what they want to do or how they want to do it. Students have their own way of learning. But the best way for them is them exploring on their own, finding their own interests of how they want to do their assignments. Sometimes students learn by comparing things of what they like to what they have to do to complete their task.

In conclusion, schools are making students complete projects during their summer break to assure that they are still continuing to learn. Making the students design their own projects will make them be more interested to what they are doing and put more time and effort. With doing the best they can their grades could be higher and help them out in the long run. For so long all year students are forced to do tasks that are designed by teachers and most of the time the task that is assigned to them is not intriguing for the students which leads them to not doing their project. So if teachers want better results and more effort into projects, projects should be designed by students and not by teachers.            ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think it is fair to the students that play sports to have just an B average, i think it should be at least an C average because some students are better in some subjects than other students and by taking that away you are taking away all some kids know. My two reasons i think its not fair are because some kids need sports, and some kids try in school but can never get there work done because some don't understand the subjects they are failing.

Some kids can't help if all they can make is an C average because some students need more help in some subjects than others, like for stay they may make straight A' s in one class but when they get to another subject they make an C. Some kids get some subjects and others do not.

My other reason is that my making them do better than a C that's asking to much for them some kids enjoy playing there sports, i know a kid whose mom made him quit playing basketball because he got one C on his report it tore him because he was really sad going to the games and him not being on the court but he was in the stands watching his team. That's all he live for was basketball. What I'm saying is make the kids take a survey just a little one explaining what they can do to bring there grades up.

In the end just give the kids another chance to explain why there are making the bad grades and to ask if they need help in anyway, but don't take away there right to play sports.

"Should all students be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? There are many children who feel like they dont belong because they hang out with the wrong group or no group. School is very hard and can be tougher with nobody to talk to when you need it. There is proof that school is harder with no friends so I think they should be required to do an extracurricular activity.

Because school can be very difficult if you have no one to talk to or nobody to hangout with. It is a good idea for children to be required to do an activity. I dont think someone should have to do what the principal wants them to do. I think they should be allowed to choose what activity they want to do. This could also help with making friends and getting to know new people and talking instead of being antisocial.

There are many benefits to doing this in your school you can find the group you are supposed to be hanging out with. Im not saying drop your friends that you already have but add them to your friends and make them feel more included. There are other benefits to doing this with your school such as learning a new sport or learning something new about a topic or game. There is also a way to communicate and get to know your teachers more like if you are not into sports I think they should make teachers participate too. The teacher have to play a sport or help kids with homework.

There are disadvantages as well as advantages of doing this idea. You are being forced to do something not everyone wants or can do. You might not be good at sports and dont want join the yearbook committee. You might not have as much fun doing these things as other children do and they might be better then you at these things. These things can be hard and you might not want to do them but there will be a reward at the end for trying something new.

I think that this is a good idea to do for students to get to know each other and hangout and have exercise . This idea is very smart but I think that at the beginning of the year children should be allowed to vote on what they want to do. They should have someone draw out of a hat and choose twenty ideas for clubs and you get new clubs every nine weeks. This is a very good idea for kids who dont like talking to people and are having problems with there sport or something. You will be making new friends and getting better at other things that you want to get better at.",0
"The face on Mars is just a natural formation. It wasn't built by any aliens. Natural formations like the face are commonly seen in that area of Mars. The formation does not completely resemble a face; there are many flaws. NASA would tell the public if they had any solid evidence that suggests it was built by aliens.

Rock formations like the face are common in that area of mars and it is very possible that they could look like a face. There are a lot of rock formations on Mars. Out of all those formations, one of them is probably going to resemble a face.

The rock formation doesn't resemble a face perfectly. There are flaws that suggests it is just a natural formation. If it was an alien built formation, there would be a lot less flaws. They wouldn't waste all that time making it and leave so many flaws.

NASA would definetely tell the public if there was any sign that an alien civilazation built it. NASA would have to tell us that they discovered a civilazation. They get their money from us. NASA would get a lot of funding to explore the face if there was any sign of any civilazation and that is what NASA is all about, exploring.

The face is just a natural formation. No aliens built the face. There are many of these types of rock formations in that area. The formation has a lot of flaws that don't resemble a face. NASA would tell the public if it was built by aliens.",0
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Sometimes people ask for advice from other people to get their opinions, for example it helps find your decision, how to execute your decision, and to know what to do afterwords. It is good to get other peoples opinions so do not be scared to ask.

The first thing getting other peoples opinions helps with is finding your decision. It helps finding your decision by finding what you agree with. Finding out what your going to do is the most important thing to do. When someone asks you for advice don't give them bad advice, because the situation could be very important.

The second thing getting advice from more than one person helps with is figuring out how your going to execute your decision. This is somewhat important depending on the situation. When going through with the decision if it could hurt the person let them down easy. When figuring out how to deal with the problem go with what you feel is right not just what other people say.

The third and final thing on my list is finding out what to do afterwords. This isn't as important as the other two things. Depending of if the situation is family or friends changes the level of importance. When you execute the choice don't get depressed and turn to drugs or alcohol turn to your friends who always have your back.

sometimes it's good to talk to other people for advice not just one person. people ask for advice from multiple people to help find their decision, how to execute the choice, and to know what to do afterwords. people who are sensitive need better advice than others and a shoulder to lean on after they do it. this was my opinion on what the subject was on. I wrote this to give some people advice on what to do when they themselves or friends/family are going through something.           ",0
"Dear principal,

What you are doing is a great idea. But some students it may not be possible for them to do community service. For instance some students are in athletics. This will take up a big portion of their time and energy. Not to mention they still have to do their homework.

Another problem may be that they have to take care of a sibling while their parents work. This may not be a problem for some, kids can go to day care. But others don't have the money to put young kids in a day care. So you would be taking away from the family in the process of helping the community. If money gets tight they may have to resort in getting a job. This will take up a big chunk of their free time and put more stress on the student.

It may be in your best interest to keep community service optional. If you do add it as a requirement student's grades will drop and students will have a difficult time paying attention in class. The reason is they will be worn out from staying up late finishing homework after their sports or jobs, and their community service. I advise you consider these situations when you make the final decision.

Sincerely, 8th grade student",0
"Philosopher, Physical, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others, actually being a example can not be a good thing to influence others becuase first you need to start doing the right thing on your own before you decide to be a example or influence others and that's mean that you need to do everything perfect when that's means that it is hard to do it.

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others.

However, they believe that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people and being a good example makes they feel responsible to others and they feel that they have the responsability to do the right way in their own so that they can be a good example to others.

In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others. They also say the having respect to others is a good example of our behaviors and being humildity is also a nice examples that we can teach or influenes to others. They believed that being honest with anyone is also a good example of our behaviors. For example, they believe that being responsible with their own behavior is a good example to start doing the right way and to influence others because the responsability gives to others respect. They say the being on time in any meeting makes they responsible with their own behavior and gives other a good example of responsability. They say that responsability is a example of our own behavior and can be something that they can learn with the time and needs practice. I believe that being honest with others is a good example by start setting our own example behaviors. I also believe that humildity is a good example of our behavior because the humildity and that responsability is something that I can learn from others with their own actions or their behaviors. For example, I learned how to be responsible with my things for my mom and my dad because they teaches me how to do it and that this need practice too and I also they teaches me that being a example with our own behavior makes you humildity and teaches you how to valore what you already has and accept what

I don't have.

In conclusion, they want to argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because being a good example by your own behavior teaches they how to do the things rights, so they can influence others by doing and taking the right way and also teach how to be responsible, honest, and being respect to others.",0
" In my opinion, the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson ring true. As he stated, ""If you do the same thing you mastered, you will never grow, but if you do more things and then you mastered, you will grow a lot."" This idea is applicable not only to personal growth but also to the growth of a business.

For example, if a company specializes in providing a particular service, such as excavation, it may be content to remain at the same level of expertise. However, if the company decides to expand its offerings to include commercial and residential construction, it will have the opportunity to grow and become more diverse. This diversification will allow the company to tap into new markets and attract a wider clientele, ultimately leading to greater success.

In addition to expanding services, a company must also have a wealth of experience and knowledge in order to grow. As Emerson said, ""Everything can go away in seconds if you don't care about it."" This means that businesses must be proactive in seeking out new experiences and knowledge in order to stay ahead of the curve. By continuously learning and growing, a company can adapt to changing market conditions and remain competitive.

In conclusion, I agree with Emerson's sentiment that ""it's always good to do more what you mastered in life."" Whether it's in business or personal growth, embracing new challenges and opportunities will lead to growth and success.",1
"I think that students should be required to have a B average.

Getting a C average means your really not trying 100%.

Everyone is capable of having even an A average.

If you pay attention in school, and are following directions, studying, working hard, then everyone should be getting all A' s.

I understand a few B' s and C' s here and there, but A' s are really not that hard to achieve.

Grades and school are huge deals.

If you want to go to college, most colleges require a B average, or 3.0 GPA.

Also, college is really expensive.

Colleges sometimes give out scholarships, but you really have to be a hard worker and get really good grades.

Sports can be key for scholarships, too.

There are both academic and sport scholarships.

I always say school before sports, cause school is really important.

If you want to get a good job, college can be insanely important.

If you screw up once, it could change your life.

It's important to be nice to your teachers, too.

Some job applications require recommendations.

You know what they say, ""The only place success comes before working hard is in the dictionary.""

So mainly, I think students should be achieving a B average no problem.

Also, it's important to stay away from drugs and alcohol.

They can really screw up your life.

I knew someone who was most likely going to go to a D-1 college for basketball, but got involved with drugs and drinking at parties, and it messed up their whole basketball career.

They could have been making millions of dollars in the NBA, but made some bad decisions and messed it all up big time.

Drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives.

Most students wouldn't like that grade change, but in the long run it's really helping them change their lives.

Some pro basketball players went from high school straight to the pros.

They really don't know much about anything now either.",0
"In today's society, it is essential to have the ability to influence others positively. This can be done through various means, including examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice. In this essay, I will analyze the effectiveness of these methods and provide evidence to support my argument.

One of the most powerful ways to influence others positively is through examples. People are often more likely to follow the actions of those they admire or respect. For instance, a teacher who consistently demonstrates a positive attitude and work ethic can inspire their students to do the same. A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that students who had a positive role model were more likely to achieve academic success and engage in prosocial behavior (Kurtz & Algoe, 2015).

Another effective method of influencing others positively is through actions. People often judge others based on their behavior, and taking positive actions can have a significant impact. For example, volunteering at a local charity or participating in a community event can demonstrate a commitment to helping others and inspire others to do the same. A study by the University of Pennsylvania found that people who engaged in prosocial behavior were more likely to be perceived as kind and compassionate by others (Dunn, 2008).

Reasons are also an effective way to influence others positively. When people understand the benefits of a particular behavior or action, they are more likely to adopt it. For example, explaining the health benefits of exercising regularly can motivate others to start an exercise routine. A study by the American Heart Association found that people who received information about the benefits of exercise were more likely to engage in regular physical activity (Hillman & Tate, 2009).

Finally, personal advice can be a powerful tool for influencing others positively. People often seek advice from those they trust and respect, and taking their advice into consideration can lead to positive changes. For example, a friend who has successfully navigated a difficult situation can offer valuable advice to someone going through a similar experience. A study by the University of California, Los Angeles found that people who received advice from others were more likely to engage in positive behaviors and achieve their goals (Rogers & Fazio, 1989).

In conclusion, examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice are all effective methods for influencing others positively.",1

They say that they are much happier without a car but they really cant be they cant go on family trips or get abunch of groceries at the store without having to carry all of them its dumb why would you want to be doing that it actaully puts more stress on you then anything else so they can get over thereselves and get a freaking car cause you know they aint happy they are just lieing. they want to call it smart planning but its really not even close to ebing smart i think its the stupidest thing ive ever heard not having a car gives you less stress what if you wake up late for work one morning your going to have to walk what if its raining outside your going to get wet what if its cold outisde or ebtter yet snowing thats going to suyck because you dont have a heater you have to walk and then your going to be stressed yeah you dont have to worry about it breaking down or gas money and stuff but still its just not right to tell people its less stress. Everything has been developed to the cars the way around, so why change it now we already took down trees moved everything and are already used to all the cars and everything why change whats not broke? Yah i get that we are polluting everything and anything but we've already ruined everything why stop now. Like come on. They blame it all on deisel fuel when it really isnt the problem the problem is all the manufacturing and crap that they are doing in all of these factories and stuff. Also they state again how its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution we have already polluted it give me a break im so tired of this boohoo crap. President Obama is an idiot hes trying to fix whats been broken and he cant fix the pollution what he can fix is all these lunch rukles because there is no reason why i can't eat candy at school get gatorades get chips his wife can be healthy all she wants but that doesnt need to include us. REcent study shows that less americans are buying cras and you know why because all amerucans pretty much have a car or are broke or homeless. With all these changes people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession may find less reason to resume habit. Then the3y are wanting to try to change the age again but i dont think that there are any advantages to limiting our car use ability.    ",0
"In society today kids have to much free time on their hands, and when kids have too much free time they tend to get into trouble. If they took away some of that free time then kids would have less time to get themselves into trouble, and it would also keep them off of technology. I agree that every kid should have at least one extracurricular activity after school.

The extracurricular activities keeps kids engaged and involved in their school community. It keeps them busy and moving around it doesn't leave them time to sit around and get in trouble. With the extracurricular activities kids wouldn't go home and have nothing to do. It also keeps their brain engaged and thinking. Kids would be learning something new and interesting everyday. They could learn a new sport and stay active at the same time. Many kids these days just go home and sit around, that isn't good for their health they need to be moving around at this age. Extracurricular actives could also teach valuable skills and lessons like how to work in a team or how to take responsibility for actions or people. These are very important skills in life,and it is very hard to teach those skills in a classroom but it is a lot easier to do on a sports field or in a extraculiclar activity.

Extracurricular activities could help kids become more social. When you join an extracurricular activity chances are you are in there with some new people that they have never met before. It gives kids a chance to meet new people their age and become friends with them. It could also help the kids that are less social or shy become more social. These kids have a hard time talking to other people and if they are given the chances to meet people and talk to them on a regular basses then hopefully they will become less shy and more social. It can also give these kids something to talk about to others. Like how their team is doing or how they like their activities. It also can help kids get over fears. Maybe a kid has stage fright and they try out for theater and the excel at it and get over the fear of stage fright. Or a kid has a fear of public speaking and they try out for the debate team and that helps the get over that fear.

It could also help kids figure out what their strengths and weaknesses are maybe they go into a sport and find out that they are really good at being a leader. That could possibly open their eyes later on down the road when they are picking their career choice or singing up for collages.

Most importantly it keeps kids out of trouble. With an extracurricular activity right after school kids can't sneak off after school and go get into trouble with their friends. Their going to be held accountable to go to their after school activity and not be late to it. This will help them develop responsablitty.

With out extraculiclar activity some kids just go home and get on technology and don't do anything. But with an activity after school it would get them moving around and not sitting on the couch all day.

An extracurricular activity would also help kids get off their phone and social media. This would also help with kids not getting in trouble on social media because the extraculirrclar activities would be phone free and the more time we get kids off of their phones the less likely they're going to get in trouble on them.

There are a lot of positives to having extraculliclar activities after school. It would help kids in a numerous amount of ways like not getting into trouble, getting off of technology,being more social, becoming more active and healthy,and becoming more engaged. ",0
"Graduating early from high school has the potential to offer certain advantages; however, there are also some disadvantages that should be taken into account. On the positive side, graduating early might give students an extra jump start on their college education or future career. It can make it possible to take classes that weren’t available during traditional high school, and it could help students to become more independent and prepare for the responsibilities of adult life. On the other hand, graduating early can also have negative effects. It can mean that some classes were skipped due to an accelerated schedule, which could result in a lack of fundamental knowledge or critical skills. Additionally, there can be a risk of missing out on unique high school experiences like dances, sports, or summer activities, which could be regretful in the long run. Ultimately, the decision to graduate early is a personal choice that is dependent on individual circumstances. Nevertheless, students should take the time to consider all of the potential pros and cons before deciding to pursue an early graduation.",1

"why would anybody want to be in a car that controls itself? What if the car breaks down in the middle of now where. What if a hacker hacks the car and drives you off a cliff or into a ocean? What if the car crashes and will not allow you to get out of the car before it blows up? Driverless cars are dangerous because you dont know what will happen once you're in a machines control.

Smart cars are not able to pull in or out of driveways, dealing with traffic, working their way through roadwork or even an accidents. Driving in and out a driveway is easy but a smart car is unable to do such a thing. A smart car has techology that i is a spinning sensor on the top called Dubbed LIDAR. that uses lasers to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars around it. So it should be able to pull in and out of driveways and also be able to coraperate in traffic.

Another example is what is a super smart hacker or terrorist hacks into the smart cars system and start creating crashes. Even if the Google cofounder Sergey creates a safe enough password someone will find a way to crack the code. There are lives at steak with these driverless cars. What if someone had a enemy decides to hack into their car, and drives them off a cliff. who will be responsable Google cofounder Sercey.

in conclusion driverless smart cars are dangerous they are just trying to make the work high tech and easy. And when i say easy i meant less work for man kind and our future. We should just leave driverless smart cars to the television and movies.  ",0
"If the principle decided on if everyone had to do an activity school would be not in good shape including that there is many reasons why this shouldn't happen. People who are in school has a higher chance of not liking school than liking it. Students have more pressure doing extra activities it is just like adding more school to school. There's more reasons for which this idea is unreliable.

There has been studies proven on which students don't like the facts on which school starts at 7:30 am in middle school which students have to wake up about at 6:00 for the bus so people have been thinking to start school somewhere near 10:00 or 9:00 which that also is aggravating of an idea because that would cause school to end at like 5:00. Some students do like school then they will volunteer for these activities there for students shouldn't be forced to do these activities. Doing sports takes time from doing homework which benefits your actual education. School is roughly about 6 hours and 45 minutes on which this goes for more than half the year and estimated students get 2 and a half months break.

There is no time to do any activities in school so that means the activities are after school. as proven this will basically add more time to school since everyone has an activity after school. The fact that most students don't like school it should mean that the principal won't give them extra work for things they may not like even though they can choose their activity, maybe all of their favorite activities are taken so they have to find an activity they don't like. this constructs the purpose on behalf that students should not be forced to do activities.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME, my piers and I have heard about what you are trying to do to our students, i highly disagree with you forcing us to do community service, i hope you take the time to read some of these suggestions.

Most students would consider community service a punishment, a very brutal punishment. You cant require students to do community service for no reason, although for a punishment for something a student has done wrong i highly agree, depending on the strength of the crime. Although your asking for all students to perform community service routinely, my main issue with your idea is that if you did make us do this, it would have to be outside of school hours, or cutting major time into our lunch/recess.

If possible, you could cut 5 minutes into each class, that would acquire 30 minutes for community service, depending on the schedule each group of students can do a different job, such as cleaning the cafeteria, hallways, courtyard and emptying the garbage/recycling bins. The concern is that you want us students to take time out of our day, when we did nothing wrong, as stated in the this paragraph you can take time out of classes, but its almost a guarantee that you wouldn't even 2nd guess that, and the students opinion.

I want you to think about how you would feel after a long day of school, 6 hours of straight learning with no breaks or free time, having to spend an hour along the highway cleaning up road kill and fast food rappers all across the ground, in the hot sun. Reading and teaching elementary school children shouldn't even be thought of, why would we drive all the way to their school in our free time to help 6th graders with their math when they can hire a tutor, or stay after class and get some extra help, sure if they are willing to come to us during school hours, otherwise i highly doubt that anyone will do your amazing plan of community service.

If a student is caught smoking illegal substances, or perhaps vandalizing, fighting, bullying/harassment, then sure, go for it, but your trying to force innocent well behaved students into doing your dirty work, cleaning up random trash across the hallways when its the custodians job. Depending on the crime entitled i think the punishment should vary, physical fighting, 2 hours of community service, smoking illegal substances, 5 hours of community service, vandalizing, 7 hours of community service, and bullying 1 hour of community service.

Why should you listen to a 14 year old telling you how to do your job? Maybe because he's speaking for the whole school, and all of us don't think its fair that you would just consider this without consulting any of us, taking a vote, or even trying to reason, i hope you get time to read this, and at least consider some changes in your plan.",0
"The dreaded summer assignment, boring students by holding them hostage inside and not letting them enjoy their time to be free. All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but then students are reintroduced to that stress with projects and extensive work that may not be of interest. The more likely the students are uninterested in the work, the more likely they are to not turn it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students want while introducing the course they are set to take. Summer assignments should be student-designed so those students can take interest in their study and make learning fun.

Nobody in the world wants to wash summer away with book work from the class they don't like. Projects like research papers, essays, and 20+ page packets can drown students for the months they have off. Summer before sophomore year, for my history class we had 2 20+ page packets to ""introduce us to the course"", when in reality, it was just a few hours a day for weeks of busy work of finding answers in textbooks. Painful summer projects, like my class's history packets, will put a bad taste in the students' mouth before they even step foot on school grounds for the year. Summer assignments have to be short, sweet, and efficient, or they will lose the student, potentially for the entire school year.

Students designing their own summer projects will interest them more in the topic, as well as transform the summer project from a burden to something students want to complete. Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint or a poster presentation, where students can go hands on while learning. Those history packets would be much more involving to me if they had to do with the World Wars or Military history, and even more if they involved some sort of project component. Disinterest also causes students to be less likely to complete summer assignments. I know of plenty of students, that just won't turn in the project or assignment if they don't want to do it. Summer of Junior year, my class had an essay to write about a current political issue. Half of the class turned in that assignment on time because they just didn't want to do it or were plainly uninterested. Summer Assignments need to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they need to grab the reader and hook them into the topic early, or in the case of summer assignments, they need to interest the student so they keep going and are hooked for the year.

The only downside to student designed projects is the way of grading and assessing their work. The more freedom students are given within a project, the further projects are going to be from what a rubric wants, which can be a pain for teachers. If you tell students to come up with an experiment and make a presentation on a tri-fold board, you could have one kid coming in with a project about wildlife and one with a project about aerodynamics for a chemistry class, two experiments no where near being on topic. There is a limit to the freedom teachers should give students, but there should be extensive freedom to the students within guidelines.

The only way for a project students like to be made, you have to consult the students. Politicians in democratic governments don't guess what the voters want, they ask what the voters want. If teachers are trying to build something for the students, ask the students, it's simple. If teachers want more interest in a course, better grades, more students willing to work, more participants in class, or better summer projects, the only way to do so is to let the students design the assignment. Students designing the project will make learning fun.",0
"Venus; the second planet in our solar system, Earth's twin, and neighbors next to Earth and Mars. Venus and Mars are the closest planets to Earth, but when moving around the sun, sometimes mars is closer to earth than venus and vice versa. Another thing about Venus is that its kind of Earth's twin. Venus is closest to Earth's size and density than all the other planets. But one thing about mars is, its virtually unexplorable. Despite the dangers on this planet, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" wants scientists to go foward into exploring Venus. Here is his evidence in his article that supports him.

Scientists have tried to explor Venus, and have spent millions of dollars on space craft to try to land on it. Those missions had to be unmanned, why though? None of the spacecrafts that went to Venus survived for lots of reasons. Venus's atmosphere is thick and is 97 percent carbon dioxide and is full of clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, also the temperature averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we feel here on earth. Venus could crush anything and liquefy our metals as well with the hottest surface temperatures in our solar system. Along with all of those factors of stopping the exploration of Venus, there are also earthquakes, erupting volcanos, and lightning strikes. Even after listing all those facts, the author still wants to study Venus.

Scientists are able to study some of Venus while being a safe distence from the planet, but they wont be able to get any fragments of the ground or any samples of the planet. Also, with the dense clouds in Venus's atmosphere, they wouldn't be able to see much of the ground. But, the author thinks they have found a way. Scientists at NASA have been testing out a some new eletronics and puttuing them to the test with similar Venus dangers, and so far they have passed. The scientists are making new technologies stronger to be able to withstand Venus, at least long enough to get what they need to be able to study venus further. I bet the author is happy about that.

This author of this article did not give up on his idea of studing Venus. No matter how many dangerous and deadly things they threw at him, and even the scientists. They never gave up hope of someday exploring venus, and now hopefully hear soon they can give the new information they have gathered from venus to the author. ",0
"These are some good reasons why it is good to ask people for some advice! It is good to ask people their own advice because you can listen and hear from differnt point of views.

When you have other peoples point of view,you get a bigger picture of what you're doing and how do to it.

You get more of an understanding and a bigger and wider verity of choices to choose from.

People ask more than one person advice so they can understand it more and not only use their on own ideas but also listen to what other people have on their mind.

Its good to ask people what their idea is because sometimes your idea doesn't always work and you need a backup if it doesn't, you may also find it helpful to go online and search differnt type of ideas from around the world.

You can also find it helpfulto ask your parents,teachers,friends, and maybe some people you may not know.

Before you think of starting anything the best thing to do is ask questions,you can get alot more information out of it then you think. Plus other people may do the same and get lot of resources to choose from. It is possible to use your own ways of thinking,but after you ask for advice you need to plan out what and how you're gonna do with the information that you have gathered together. You may also want to do a rough draft or write on a piece paper before you ask for any advice,it may give you a better headstart then jumping straight to it and asking questions.

You could also make one of those Diagram so you can compare and see whats differnt from the advice that you have so you can see if its alot better. You have to ask yourself questions like, ""Does it make sense?,"" ""Does it have an meaning?,"" ""Does it have an main idea to it?,"" and ""Does it talk about what im typing/writing about?,""those are some simple questions you can always ask yourself before you start typing/writing. It is more simple then brain storming your own idea and trying to figure out alot of stuff by yourself,that'll take alot of time and it'll be more frustrating then usual,but all you have to do is ask a close by friend or family member what their idea on something would be. After you get all of your information and details about what you wanna type/write about to get now easily put it down on whatever paper or computer you're using at the moment,you will get it done faster,more neat,and more detailed then you would have if you wouldve thought of an idea by yourself. You can still make ideas by yourself but asking for advice would be alot more easy then you think!        ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally feel rethinking the policy of having cell phones in school is a great idea. In my opinion, having cell phones at school would be a privilege. I have came up with two reasons why having cell phones at appropriate times should be a school policy.

First of all, in this generation having a cell phone with you is a must. You always see teens with cell phones. Teens and cell phones are like alcoholics and alcohol.

You can't keep them apart, or they become a mess. Teens are addicted to cell phones. Even when they're not suppose to use their cell phones, they do it anyways. Giving them the privilege to use their phones at school at appropriate times could increase the number of students that get in trouble because of their cell phones.

Secondly, cell phones could help in case of emergencies. During an emergency you can't always reach a telephone. If teens could have cell phones at school getting in touch with a family member wouldn't be a problem. Announcing on the intercom the appropriate time when to get in touch with a family member could help out a lot.

In conclusion, you changing the policy to, ""yes students can use their cell phones at appropriate times"" could make an impact on the school. You can always make more exceptions to the policy for those who don't abide by it. I hope you take my letter into consideration, and that my reasons why we should have cell phones in school makes an impact. Thank you for your time and patience.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"I dont think that driverless cars should be developed. The reason i think this is because of all of the problems that driverless cars could pose. Drivng is all ready dangerous enough and they want to risk peoples lives with machines driving themselves around without humans controlling them? I could see how some people might think it could possibly be a good idea. But the dangers far outway any reward that could come from driverless cars. Not only would they pose a serious threat to other drivers on the road, but like the article said, if a car malfunctions and causes an accident then who is at fault? The human in the car or the manufacturer that produced the car that malfunctioned. Even if driverless cars could be produced they are nowhere near being ready to be used on the open road.

Plus what would a the driverless car do if it got stuck in traffic or ended up having to pull over for a school bus or an emergency vehicle? And if the car started breaking traffic laws or started driving wrecklessly then how would the person get a ticket if he was not the one that was driving carelessly? The way i see it is that human driven cars have done the job perfectly for one hundred years. And since the way we drive is doing just fine why try to add more dangers and make it more complicated. What would happen to the manufacturer of the car if the car got on the road and malfunctioned and ended up killing somebody. I think that this is another case of people getting carried away with technology and not understanding or not caring about the potentially fatal dangers of putting driverless cars on the road with families.

This is the reason that i feel the way i do about giving machines freedom and trusting them to drive on the road with other people. I feel that the dangers far outway the risks for this idea and it will be much too expensive to try to adjust the roads to let independant machines drive around on them and endanger other innocent drivers on the road.-",0
"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand the benefits of continuing to learn new skills and information. Learning new things helps us to develop our expertise and expand our knowledge. It also helps us to stay current with the latest advancements in our fields and to remain competitive in the workforce.

One quote that emphasizes the importance of continuing to learn is by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote suggests that we should not simply follow the path that others have taken, but rather forge our own path and create our own opportunities. By continuing to learn and develop our skills, we can do just that.

An example of people learning new skills and knowledge can be seen in the field of technology. Every day, new software and tools are being developed that make our lives easier and more efficient. People in this field must continue to learn and adapt in order to stay current and remain competitive.

Education is also an important aspect of discovering what we are truly passionate about. By taking classes and exploring different subjects, we can find out what interests us and what we are good at. This can help us to make informed decisions about our future and to pursue careers that we are truly passionate about.

Finally, it is important to push ourselves further despite already achieving success. By continuing to learn and develop our skills, we can become even better at what we do and achieve even greater success. Whether it's in our personal lives or in our careers, pushing ourselves further can lead to new opportunities and a greater sense of fulfillment.

In conclusion, continuing to learn new skills and information is crucial for personal and professional growth. By developing our expertise and expanding our knowledge, we can stay current with the latest advancements and remain competitive in the workforce. Education is also an important aspect of discovering what we are truly passionate about, and pushing ourselves further can lead to new opportunities and a greater sense of fulfillment.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals and communities. The examples provided in the passage set highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to air pollution, releasing harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights the negative impact of car emissions on air quality. Intense smog levels in the city prompted the enforcement of a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for individuals to live in.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity and overall health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota demonstrates how promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and skating can encourage people to engage in physical activity. By incorporating active modes of transportation into our daily routines, we can improve our cardiovascular health and reduce the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban highlights the concept of ""smart planning,"" which aims to separate suburban life from car use. By designing communities with pedestrian-friendly streets and access to public transportation, we can create more compact and accessible neighborhoods. Placing stores within walking distance, rather than on distant highways, encourages active transportation and reduces the need for car dependency.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and creating more sustainable communities, we can create a healthier and more environmentally-friendly future. It is important to consider alternative modes of transportation and implement smart planning strategies to reduce our reliance on cars and create a more sustainable society.",1
" In his time as a British Minister, Winston Churchill famously said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" This statement holds true today, as many people continue to fail and give up on their dreams. However, Churchill's words remind us that failure is not the end, but rather an opportunity for growth and improvement.

One of the reasons that failure plays a crucial role in success is that it teaches us what went wrong. When we fail, we are forced to examine our actions and identify the areas where we need to improve. This process of self-reflection can be uncomfortable, but it ultimately leads to better decision-making and a greater chance of success in the future.

Another reason that failure is important is that it makes us stronger. When we face adversity, we are forced to push ourselves beyond our limits and find new sources of strength within ourselves. This process of overcoming failure can be difficult, but it ultimately leads to greater resilience and a better ability to handle future challenges.

Finally, failure can help us become better people. When we fail, we are forced to confront our weaknesses and vulnerabilities, which can lead to personal growth and self-improvement. This process of self-discovery can be challenging, but it ultimately leads to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

In conclusion, while failure may seem like a setback at first, it ultimately plays a crucial role in success. By learning from our mistakes, becoming stronger, and growing as individuals, we can turn our failures into stepping stones on the path to success. So, the next time you fail, don't give up. Instead, take the opportunity to learn and try again until you succeed.",1
"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. The author supports this claim by stating that the insight to be gained is significant and by offering methods for obtaining these insights despite the danger that is readily appearant.

Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment. Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.

NASA is one organization that has been developing particularly interesting ideas about how to further study Venus. They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.

According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point. Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.

The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.",0
"Cell Phones vs. Cars

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing drivers to become distracted and get into accidents. Many laws in the United States regulate the use of mobile phones while driving. Teen drivers are most likely to be on their phones while driving, which can be a gamble with their life and the lives of other drivers. Driving can be very dangerous especially when using a cell phone.

Using a cell phone while driving is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing drivers to become distracted and get into accidents. Car accidents happen every day, 16 percent of those accidents are related to cell phones. That's more than the percentage of accidents caused by bad weather. Not only have cell phones been known to distract drivers from driving but all distract people from walking, working, and homework.

Many laws in the United States regulates the use of a mobile phone while driving. Recently a new law came into effect on July 1 stating that using a cellphone while driving will be illegal in Georgia. In Florida texting and driving become prohibited at midnight. Florida is a lot more lenient than Georgia about texting and driving but facts are facts. Driving while on the phone can become hazardous.

Teen drivers are most likely to be on their phones while driving, which can be a gamble with their life and the lives of other drivers. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. All of these are legitimate reasons to start cracking down on the use of cell phones while driving. Not only can you endanger your own life but cost other theirs.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system in presidential elections. While there are valid arguments to change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that should be considered. I have thoroughly analyzed the information from various sources and would like to present my case based on the texts provided.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome, which is less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. As highlighted in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all approach in most states creates a landslide victory, minimizing the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This stability in outcome ensures that the election process does not suffer from prolonged uncertainty and potential disputes.

Another critical benefit of the Electoral College system is that it promotes the representation of all regions and discourages candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated areas. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, regional favorites without nationwide appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents. Under the Electoral College, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This ensures that the president represents various regions of the country and takes into account the interests of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location.

The third advantage of the Electoral College system lies in its promotion of swing states. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's text, the winner-take-all approach incentivizes candidates to focus on competitive states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention, leading to better-informed and thoughtful decision-making. By concentrating campaign efforts in these states, candidates are more likely to engage with citizens, discuss important issues, and address the concerns of the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance regarding the influence of large states versus small states. Large states, as Bradford Plumer highlights in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This helps prevent the political disadvantages that large states face as a consequence of the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing a larger political weight to large states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must campaign across both large and small states, guaranteeing a more inclusive approach to the electorate.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the pressure for additional elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the complications and challenges associated with run-off elections and maintains the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College system can discourage some potential voters in states where their preferred candidate does not have a chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of eligible American citizens still exercise their right to vote in presidential elections. As voters, we express our political preferences and values, regardless of the potential impact of our individual votes on the national outcome. The Electoral College does not prevent citizens from engaging in the electoral process but ensures that all states and regions have a meaningful role in electing the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, as established by our founding fathers, offers crucial benefits that should be taken into consideration. It promotes stability in election outcomes, encourages the representation of all regions, focuses campaigns on competitive swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. I respectfully request that you consider these points in your decision-making as you deliberate on the future of our electoral system.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives presented in this letter along with the information provided in the supporting texts. I look forward to witnessing your thoughtful determination on this matter that affects our democratic process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"I think it should be  the most votes each president because it should be majority rule so if many people pick one president and the other only gets a couple the one with the most should win because the peoples voice should choose who is over them.

Also because if everyone vote for this one president there electoral college can still vote for the opposite of them and go against the ones that want to vote for that particular president.

The electoral college vote is unfair to some people because they only have like a 50 percent chance to get the president they want in the white house.

If the congress or whoever was to abolish the electoral congress vote I think we would see numerous of changes in our past history and our future, so in the end it is basically like all of our votes are going to be voting vor the electoral votes then it goes to the president voting. After so long many people are going to stop voting, but not all because some people like it this way. the reason to that is because so many people are going to pay attention to their votes not being counted to the presidents voting stand. And since they know their vote is not being counted many people are going to stop voting.          ",0
"Dear principal, I STUDENT_NAME a student in SCHOOL_NAME do not like your opinion in the new policy . The grade doesn't mater in sports or in talent . The grades shouldn't matter because they don't belong in sports. What if you wanted to play a sport in your school but you have low grades and cant play , how would you feel ? Well i would feel not important and not valuable. I really like that sport but cant play it because of my grades . Its not fair that only people with good grades or a b average can play sports . What if I was one of the best soccer players and I have a c average , would you let me play or would you let the soccer team loose in all of the games , and be named the worst soccer team in Texas. Or would you leave the policy as it is. Not change anything and let me play ,and make the soccer team win, and be named the champions because we always win in all of the games .",0
"The Importance of Positive Attitude on Success

Introduction

The way we think and perceive the world around us has a significant impact on our success in life. A positive attitude is the key to achieving our goals and living a fulfilling life. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of having a positive attitude on success, examine the views of experts on the importance of having a positive attitude for students, analyze how having a positive attitude can help with achieving goals, evaluate how the positive attitude of others can impact oneself, outline how having a positive attitude can manifest in people's daily lives, and discuss the overall effects of having a positive attitude on success.

Benefits of Positive Attitude on Success

Positive thinking can help us overcome obstacles and challenges that come our way. When we have a positive attitude, we tend to focus on the opportunities and possibilities rather than the negative aspects of a situation. This can help us to stay motivated and focused on our goals, which can lead to greater success.

Experts believe that having a positive attitude is crucial for students. According to Dr. Carol Dweck, a psychologist and author of ""Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,"" students with a fixed mindset, or the belief that their abilities are innate and cannot be changed, are less likely to take risks and achieve their goals. In contrast, students with a growth mindset, or the belief that their abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication, are more likely to embrace challenges and persist in the face of setbacks.

Achieving Goals

Having a positive attitude can also help us to achieve our goals. When we have a positive outlook, we tend to be more optimistic and confident in our abilities. This can help us to take action and make progress towards our goals. Additionally, a positive attitude can help us to overcome procrastination and self-doubt, which can be major barriers to achieving success.

Impact of Positive Attitude of Others

The positive attitude of others can also impact our own attitudes and beliefs. When we surround ourselves with positive and supportive people, we tend to adopt their positive outlook on life. This can help us to stay motivated and focused on our goals, even when faced with challenges or setbacks.

"Many people constantly have to face the dilemma of choosing their life or their device while driving such as responding to a quick text, checking notifications or switching from Justin Bieber to Ed Sheeran. What seems like a simple answer may not be simple to others. Which leads to the question, should drivers be able to use their phones while driving freely? I strongly agree that phones should be banned in every capacity while operating a moving vehicle. As there are a numerous of consequences to this action, it's crazy to say that they are still many who don't understand the dangers of it. Keeping a stable lifestyle is the goal and doing what is right for you is important to follow so knowing before you do is helpful for certain circumstances.

The usage of a cellular phone while driving increases the risk of a crash. According to an Edgar Snyder associates article, ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year."" How exactly? When a notification or ringer sounds it grabs the attention of the driver tempting them to check it immediately making it a distraction. This not only risks you as the driver but the others nearby who are also not always paying the most attention. Death is a major effect when it comes to any distracted devices in a car. Ways to prevent this situation would be to turn all devices on mute, complete any calls or texts before you start moving and check in with your friends/family after the arrival to prevent the urge.

Choices made, whether bad or good, follow you forever and affect everything else in your path one way or another. Everytime you decide to focus on your phone instead of the road you are risking your life and the payments of it. When you get into a wreck regardless of who is at fault, the insurance rate will most likely increase. This creates extra unnecessary payments which takes a chunk of money out of your paycheck. Also when in a motor vehicle accident case payment of your medical bills will differ depending on who is the cause of the crash. However health is important yet expensive so this might follow you even after the situation possibly leaving you with thousands of dollars to pay off. Not to mention vehicle repairment is not cheap and only starts from 175$-500$ and if a new transmission is needed then prices can reach from 1,800 to a high as 4,000$. All these extra costs could be avoided if you don't let electronics get the best of you.

However, phones are the main resource for communicating which is essential in every aspect throughout the day. Whether it's to make a business call, call your loved ones or respond to a notification, cellular devices are always stuck to us like a magnet. Yes it is a distraction, but what about in an emergency when you need to speak to either a law enforcement agency, medical provider, fire department or even a family emergency. Paper maps can be confusing and now that phones have a gps, that makes going from A to B such a breeze. Meaning you would have to follow the directions of your phone either way. Multitasking is also a skill most people can do while driving and that isn't always with a telephone such as applying makeup, eating food or grabbing something on another seat. You may feel like you can respond quick at a glance and then boom you crash, the outcome can be of endless possibilities.

We all have rules we follow and set just like the government does. New laws are constantly being passed every year. Here in Georgia cellular devices while operating a vehicle is a serious violation. According to a USA today article, ""Drivers can no longer have phones touching any part of their body while talking through devices, the safety office stated. Reading emails, social media posts and text messages is banned, as well as writing any such content."" in regards to what governor Nathan Deal signed. The hands free Georgia act has seemed to be helping and improving this habit drivers. The fine for a first conviction is $50.00 and 1 point is evaluated against the driver's license. The fine is $100.00 and 2 points for a second conviction and $150.00 and 3 points for three or more conviction. Signs everywhere around Atlanta that states the new law reminds citizens to think twice about taking their eyes off the road.

Phones connect us with the world through time and space. However phones while driving a vehicle is a question people ask if it's okay or not. In my eyes it leads to problems no one needs . From distractions to risking the lives of others to extra payments to emergencies to the law needs to be followed. Money is heavily spent on the worst outcomes to car crashes but nothing equals death and being gone over a phone. Emergencies are common and everyone has them but something you can never take back is life so it's best to think fully before you do. Even if many have gotten away with it once before, someone is always watching and if it's the cops you're on your own with the ticket. Maybe that will help your actions be took into consideration.         ",0
"There are many people in this world that want change and that includes me, if you would take five minutes out of your day to listen to what I have to say.

I think the United States Of America should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College has been here for countless years and many people would be dissapointed that it's gone, people would drowl over it for a very long time, but there are good and bad avantages for both circumstances. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, that can sum up if someone wins or loses, a big disadvantage in the longrun. Over 60% of voters would perfer a direct election, if we got that voters would not be pressured at all and would have a very good vote that can be proud of.

There all lots of things wrong with the Electoral College System in my opinon, like that when you vote for your President, your also choosing the electors that come along with him/her. There have way over the amount of problems with electors over the past year and it is a huge problem that only some people have noticed. What if there is a prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, that would lead to big time problems and there is a severe chance it will happen. In the United States there are millions of people voting and there not making the votes they really want because the electors.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters, if someone is favored the outrageous voters know about the winner-take-all system in each state. The Electoral College System is messing our society up every 4 years, its unfair, outdated, and irrational in so many ways. For an example, in the 2000 U.S presidential race, Al Gore received more indiviual votes then George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. Don't get me wrong Bush was a great president, but facts are facts.                                ",0
"Dear Mrs. Principal:

For students everywhere, the best part of school is trying out for sports. There's a different activity for all kinds of kids. Golf is for the quiet ones while football is for the loud and rowdy students. Most of these students try hard in school to get a C average, lot less a B. Some simply cannot get grades that high while others don't seem to care enough. The reason they come to school is not because they want to do algebra or literature but because they enjoy playing the sport that is afterward. You have to understand that all students on teams can't always afford to get B' s.

Not everyone is an Albert Einstein. Most students are happy with a C on a report card because a C is average. There is nothing wrong with that. B' s are harder to come by as you get older because the material you are learning becomes tougher. Some students, however, cannot absorb enough material to get a higher grade. Their mind won't hold anymore information about a subject, and the student only remembers a few things. Other children forget information. They don't do it on purpose, but it does happen. As you know, not everyone is an excellent test taker. As soon as a test is handed out, all of the information needed to take a test flies straight from the mind. Test weigh more then homework or other assignments in a grade book, so if someone were to get a 50% on a test, that would bring any grade down to a C. Now if a student has a C, they can't participate in sports if you pass this new standard. Teenagers nowadays could honestly care less about school. They come for the social time, clubs to take a role in, and sports to participate in. C is average. Anyone can make a C who isn't trying. Kids do that so they can play in sports and still hold themselves as an average student.

So, as you can see, raising the standard to a B instead of a C would not help students, but hurt them. The best player on the team could have a C average but not be able to play. This would hurt the team and then you would feel bad because you set them up for failure. It's not easy to get a B average. Very few students can. Mentality space is different for every person. No two people have exactly the same grades. Consider the ones who are horrible test takers. Their grade falls because they forget material and then they can't play sports. Do you really want to crush a kids hopes and dream? Consider this letter as you think about raising something to an impossible standard.

From,

A worried C student wanting to play sports",0
"In the article it talks about a facon mars that has appeared on Viking 1 while looking for a place to land. The face is a natral land form because thats like saying our land forms were made by aliens and thats why we have mountains, valleys, and plains.

The article also states about the face on mars""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.""Another quote that proves this is a land form is ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the Face on mars.""The photo of mars is a land form because it says right there in the passage it is a lava dome and it is about the same hieght as the face on mars.

"Hey, guys! 😃 So, for our essay, we gotta argue for why we should let us have our phones in school. 📱 I think it's a pretty good idea, and here's why...

First of all, phones are like, super useful. 🤯 We can use 'em to look up stuff for projects, or to text our friends when we're bored in class. 😴 And, like, if there's an emergency or something, we can use our phones to call our parents or the office. 📞 It's just practical, you know?

Another thing is, phones are like, a big part of our lives now. 📱 Like, everyone's got one, and it's how we communicate with each other. 🤝 So, if we're not allowed to have our phones in school, it's gonna be hard to keep in touch with our friends and family when we're not there. 🤷‍♀️ And, like, it's not fair to expect us to just, like, ignore our phones all day. 🙅‍♀️

Plus, having phones in school could actually help us learn. 🤓 Like, we could use our phones to look up stuff for history or science projects, or to play educational games. 📚🕹️ It's like, a built-in educational tool! 😮

Now, I know some people might be worried about distractions, but I think that's a pretty small risk. 🙅‍♂️ Like, if we're not supposed to use our phones during class, that's fine. 📚👍 But, if we're allowed to have 'em, we can use 'em responsibly. 💪

So, overall, I think it's a good idea to let us have our phones in school. 📱 It's practical, it's helpful, and it's just, like, a normal part of our lives now. 🤷‍♀️",1
"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, '' A Problem is a change for you to do your best.'' I agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. Unfortunately that not the case. Mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. But adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem. You should be always motivated to do your best.

If you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. No mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. If you don't win that game you at least know that you tried your best. If you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would I have won. This not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. There are many more examples you can try to be your best.

Some times adults have to face problem and they don't know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. They give up form the start they don't try there best when facing that problem. They simply give up. They miss out on that chance. For example, My dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. He did not try his best. he simply gave up. But you should never give up always give it your best no matter what.

Form trying your best you don't lose any thing you only gain something. you can't follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. you will face problems no matter what path you take. For example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. he gave it his best. So why should you not give it your best .

No matter who you are, you should take the words of Duke Ellington and try you best when facing a problem. Does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. or trying to achieve you dreams . Never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it.",0
"have you ever done at least one extracurricular activity at your school before ? i have never had a no expedients in doing a extracurricular activity before in my option i think my school should make students do extracurricular activity at school because maybe it will be a good way to have more movement in your body and learning new things to do not always sitting and copping down notes but its not always boring doing those things but maybe having extracurricular activity at my school could be a good thing for all the students so they could have something to do instead of shitting down doing nothing and just being lazy.

i support this division that the principal is making because students could learn how to make new friends students can learn how to talk to one an other and can learn how to do things as a team making new friends isnt always a bad thing to do when making a new friends they could show you new things that you have never done or speak laggugis you have never spoke or food you have never seen before thats why when you make new friends you might just learn new things, students should communicate with more people because it could take them to so may places when they learn how to communicate to other people in the world and not always to the same people like your friends it really import that students at a young age should learn how to talk to other people without being shy. and when communicating to people thats how to make new friends,, and team work is a good thing to do because it will teach you hoe to work as a team and not be alone it will teach you hoe to talk to one an other and also make you learn that you dont always have to do things alone also make new friends team work make people closer people they help each other when they need help on something and if you dont like to do team work things you should at least give it a chance because if you dont gibe things first chances how are you gonna know if you like it or not.

this would be good for the students because they could talk to more people they dont know and they can do more active activities and learn how to work together as a team .do you think that having extracurricular activity at your school is a bad thing to do?                     ",0
"People should try to be Seagoing Cowboys because you get to save the lives of animals that have been injured during the World War II. I was in it and it was just great to be able to help all of those horses. It can get hard somwtimes but it is still great. You also have a bettere communication with the animals and get to meet new people. Sometimes when you have free time you can go visit the beautiful sites! It is a very busy job and you get tired a loy. Sometimes you have to watch the animals every hour to make sure they're safe. You wouldn't want them to escape and get hurt!

Helping all of those animals can really open up your mind and see how much some animals are suffering. It is great that there are programs like this that can help so many animals. It is a great adventure to go on and it is very fun! If you get bored on the boat you can go play some games like we did like volleyball or table tennis or anything you can think of! It is a very wonderful experience. Something wonderful as that could only come once in a life time. So i encourage you to become a Seagoing Cowboy and save the lives of many animals like me!",0
"Us students who are participating in sports for our school should be able to play in our sports if we have a C average. Why would just our school change? The other schools were playing against wouldn't change their grade averages.

We would be held to higher standards then the other schools we compete against.

This isn't fair to us as students, most of us already have a B average but if we maybe bomb a test or do bad on a homework assignment that would maybe make a player miss a game? For one little homework assignment?

We wouldn't want that to happened to us.

With a B average there would be some advantages to it too, other schools would give us more respect, teachers would give us more respect for getting our homework done and winning the game we played the day before.

If we raised the average to a B, us students should have a higher expectation as the other students in our school and be able to maybe miss one homework assignment during the season and not let it affect our grade so much.

But with a C average instead of a B it gives you a little more comfort room, so if you bomb a test, do bad on a homework assignment, you wouldn't miss a game, practice or tournament.

This allows our student athletes to focus on school and their sport they're participating in and do as best as they possibly can in both of these categories. Instead of missing a game the student might be able to retake the test and get a higher score.

We student athletes feel it's unfair to give us higher expectations then the other student athletes around us, the we compete against. This would give the other schools an advantage to practice their sport extra time while were trying to study for a retake test that we didn't do so good on.

Everyone in the district should be held to the same standards, same rules and same expectations.

There would be more disadvantages to the students if this rule was put into affect, i think for now, we should stick with a C average and maybe next year, as a district make a decision so not only one school is held to higher standards and expectations compared to the other schools around it.",0
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about why having a positive attitude is, like, super important in life. I mean, let's be real, life can be pretty tough sometimes, but if you have a positive attitude, it makes everything so much better.

First of all, having a positive attitude means that you're more likely to be happy. Like, duh, right? If you're always thinking about the good things in life, you're gonna be way happier than if you're always focusing on the bad stuff. And who doesn't want to be happy? It's like, the best feeling in the world. Plus, when you're happy, you're more likely to be successful in whatever you do. Like, think about it, if you're always positive and optimistic, you're gonna be way more motivated to work hard and reach your goals.

But it's not just about being happy, having a positive attitude can also help you in, like, so many other ways. For example, if you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to make friends and connect with people. Like, if you're always smiling and being friendly, people are gonna want to be around you. And if you're in a tough situation, like a difficult class or a hard challenge, having a positive attitude can help you stay focused and motivated. Like, you can be like, ""Hey, this is tough, but I can do it!"" instead of being all down and stuff.

And let me tell you, I know this from personal experience. Like, last year I was in this super hard math class and I was totally struggling. But instead of getting all down and giving up, I decided to have a positive attitude and focus on learning as much as I could. And guess what? I ended up getting an A on the final exam! It was like, the best feeling ever.

But it's not just about school, having a positive attitude can also help you in life in general. Like, if you're always positive and optimistic, you're gonna be way more resilient when things get tough. You can be like, ""Hey, this sucks, but I can get through it!"" instead of",1
"In the ""German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a new district that has forbidden street parking, driveways, garages. The residents of this upscale community are suburbans poineers.

In france, there is one street that has a tram that runs to downtown. The tram is only thing that drives on the road. there are 2 places to park, one is you park at a large garage at the end of the development , two is  to buy a space for 40,000 dallors and also a home. 70% of vauban do not own cars and 57% sold there cars. I say they should all have cars and drive on then roads because its easier to get around and faster. they should make deals with everyone because so everyone has a chance to drive.

On the other hand, they should not use cars because they would have to pay for gas and people would cause accidents and get hurt or killed. Cars can be very dangerous and could brake down or cause your life. They can be expensive and some that you can not afford.

" The four-day work week with ten-hour days has become a popular trend among businesses in an effort to conserve energy and resources. However, this concept is not without its drawbacks, especially for students. While it may seem like a good idea to conserve energy, it is important to consider the impact on students.

Firstly, students will be upset with the new schedule. Ten hours in school is a lot of time, and many students may not want to attend school for that long. This could lead to decreased attendance and lower academic performance.

Secondly, the four-day work week with ten-hour days is not much different from the traditional five-day work week with eight-hour days. The teachers will still leave after the students, and the amount of time spent in school will remain the same. This means that the energy and resources saved by the new schedule may not be as significant as expected.

Thirdly, the school schedule is different from a business schedule. If a school only operates four days a week, it will not be the same as operating five days a week. The teachers will still leave after the students, and the amount of time spent in school will remain the same. This means that the energy and resources saved by the new schedule may not be as significant as expected.

Moreover, students who have part-time jobs after school may lose their jobs due to the new schedule. This could have a significant impact on their financial stability and overall well-being.

In conclusion, while the four-day work week with ten-hour days may seem like a good idea to conserve energy and resources, it is not without its drawbacks, especially for students. The new schedule may lead to decreased attendance, lower academic performance, and financial instability for students who have part-time jobs. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the impact of this concept before implementing it in schools.",1
"Have you ever needed advise on something in your life? You may have had a problem and needed input. Or you may have had to make a decision and needed help on deciding what to do. It helps when you talk to more people about your situation. When you need advise it is best to talk to multiple people because different people have different experiences, different people can help you see the different points of view, and hearing more than one solution can help you understand your situation more.

The first reason it is best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because different people have different experiences. People tend to look at problems based on the experiences they have gone through and if one person has gone through something similar than they can tell you what they did. For example when someone asked me a difficult question I asked my two of my friends for advise. One of the had never been in a situation like that and did not know what to say. My other friend had been in a similar situation and she knew exactly what to say. Someone who has been through a lot in life can give advise based on everything they have been through. The different experiences will give you different options to look at. The more options you have the more likely you are to make a good decision.

The second reason it best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because different people can help you see different points of view. When you talk to just one person about your issue, especially if that one person has the same opinion as you, than it can be hard to see the different angles. If you talk to lots of people they can point out different things that you may have not thought about. When I wanted to end a relationship I talked to a lot of different people about the best way to do it and they made it easier for me to see the point of view of the other person. Seeing an issue from different points of view will make you realize more about the issue and make a better choice. Also seeing a different point of view will help you make a choice that benefits all the people the problem is effecting.

The last reason it is best to talk to multiple people when you need advise is because hearing more than one solution can help you understand the situation more. Sometimes you don't fully understand everything your going through and hearing lots of peoples input can help you understand everything better. For example if your talking to someone about what you going through and they tell you how they see it than you would understand everything more. The more advise you get the more people are talking about the problem and the more you understand everything. It is important to understand everything because if you don't then you may make the wrong decision.

In life you will have problems that you need advise on. One person does not know everything so they can not give all the answers. When lots of people give you advise it helps you a lot more. The more input you get the more likely you are to make an informed decision. If you need help it is better to ask multiple people about it because people have been through different things, people can help you see the different angles of the problem, and the more advise you get the more you understand your problem.           ",0

"As a student in grade 12, I believe that the legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. While some argue that legalizing marijuana would provide economic benefits and reduce crime rates, others maintain that it is a dangerous drug that should remain illegal. In this essay, I will present my argument against the legalization of marijuana.

Firstly, marijuana is known to have negative effects on mental health. Research has shown that regular use of marijuana can lead to increased risk of developing mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. This is especially concerning for young people whose brains are still developing. Legalizing marijuana would only make it more accessible to young people, potentially leading to more cases of mental illness.

Secondly, marijuana is a gateway drug that can lead to the use of harder drugs. While proponents of legalization argue that marijuana is not addictive, it is still a drug that can lead to dependence and abuse. Studies have shown that people who use marijuana are more likely to try other drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. Legalizing marijuana would only make it easier for people to obtain and potentially become addicted to harder drugs.

Lastly, legalizing marijuana would send the wrong message to young people. It would imply that drug use is acceptable and even encouraged by society. This could have disastrous consequences for future generations, leading to increased drug use and addiction. We should be sending a message to young people that drug use is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.

In conclusion, while there are arguments in favor of legalizing marijuana, I believe that the risks outweigh the benefits. Legalizing marijuana would have negative consequences for mental health, lead to increased drug use, and send the wrong message to young people. Instead, we should focus on educating people about the dangers of drug use and finding alternative ways to boost the economy and reduce crime rates.",1
"Cell phones while driving

Cell phones while driving is one of the biggest issues that we have today. Everyone has a cell phone so more than likely it's in there hand 24/7, When it goes off while they are driving they automatically think that they have to check it right then and there no matter if it is a message, social media, or even a phone call. Cell phones while driving should be stopped for the safety of the people on the roads and even your own life. No matter if you can drive and be on the phone, think of the others that you are putting in danger.

When you get notifications you have to look down for quite some time, It is dangerous to type and read while on the road so why put yourself and others life at risk. While you are reading or even texting you are putting all of your thought into the conversation that you are not focused on the road. You could be texting or looking at your phone and slowly losing control of the car which could easily cause a car crash that you could have avoided just by paying attention to the road.

Making phone calls while driving are dangerous as well. I understand that you could be busy and have important calls coming in or even going out, but they can truly wait until you come to a stop or even make it to your destination. There should be absolutely no reason to pick up or even have your phone in your hand whatsoever. If the call is really important then you can pull over from where you are and answer the phone at least try to think about others on the road

A call or even a text can wait until you get to where you are going, ,cell phones should not be allowed while you are driving. Be aware of everyone's safety not just yours. Think of all the things that I just said and take them into consideration. Others may say that being on the phone while driving is not bad if you know what you are doing but why take a risk at something that you can avoid.

"Students use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.

The students we should to consider for what they permit us use our cell phone in the class, and they give us the opportunity and don't spend our time and others things and we should focus in our work.

Many student's when the teacher said you gays can use your phone in the class for search information or some work sometimes that we do is play video games, or see Facebook, Instagram or something else and we don't focus in that the teacher said in the classroom, and spend our time and things that affect us.

For example i know a person when i was in my country when we are in the class the teacher said search information in internet that story of this person or when we was in math class, uses our phone for the calculator but there was one girl that she never do that the teacher say and she start to see Facebook and send messages to his friend that are in the same class and that affect the persons who her is message sometimes there is students that they absolutely do that the teacher say or the school and that case, is really good idea use the cell phone cause help us in the class or to have more information about something that we want to know for example in my case i am a person that don't have too much time in this country, and sometimes when i am reading in my English class and find one word or sentence what i dont know what is that means i need search information about that for understand what am doing, is the same in my math class too much times i dont know how traduce symbols and need use my phone for that i think of that way is very good, school permit us use our cell phone too can be the best way for learn more things and makes our work in the way that the students likes also can be more helpful for the student's and also for the teacher's.

I think all depends of the student, use cell phone in class can affect or also can be good idea for learn in the school the school give us the opportunity, that use our phone we should that feel grateful for the opportunity and uses the phone for the work not for other things what can do that our grades come down.",0

Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should let students bring their phones to school because you never know when they be an emergency. What if someone comes in tries to rob the school and you cant call for help. The students can call or text for help. I do think students should be only allowed to use their phones in their own time or in lunch but not in class. If you let students bring phones to school you have an advantage because they can call a student that didn't come to school that day and ask why didn't they come.

I really do think that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, because you never know when you might need them . I do think they should have the phones of in class because they can get distracted and not put attention to the teacher. You can also use the help of the student incase you lost somebody or cant find them. I also think it will give them something to distract them. So they wont just think of school and the tests. Cell phones should be allowed for many reasons such as if they go on a field trip and their parents don't know what time to pick them up from school. They can just call their parents when there heading to school already. What if the have to stay after school? What if there parents don't pick up? They cant just stand their in front of the office until they pick up. So if you have your phone you can just text them or call them at what ever time you want with a teachers consent if your in class.

What if they had an accident and they need another pair of clothes but they don't answer from the school phone? You can just call your parents and tell them to bring you a new pair of cothes .

What if you get injured in game or playing outside? If students could take their phones to school it would be much better.

Well TEACHER_NAME

i have giving you several reasons why should you let us students bring phones to school. Know its your decision to",0
"Cell phones have become invaluable tools, especially for students. While cell phones offer many advantages, there are some potential drawbacks to using them in the classroom for educational purposes.

On the positive side, cell phones can be used to help students keep up with course work and class notes. Not only do they provide a convenient way to take notes, but they can also be used to access educational websites, virtual classrooms, and online videos and articles. Additionally, cell phones can be used for communication purposes, such as group collaboration on group projects or critical discussions of course material.

Despite the potential advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. For instance, students may be distracted by their phones, leading to a decrease in information retention and overall learning. Additionally, if cell phones aren’t used correctly, it could potentially lead to decreased grades. Proper responding to emails and texting in the classroom must be monitored to ensure cell phone use will be productive and not a distraction.

Overall, the use of cell phones in the classroom should not be discouraged, but instead should be used with caution and structure. When used correctly, cell phones offer an effective tool for students to access course information and engage in meaningful discussions. However, it is important to be mindful of how cell phone use can negatively affect student grades if not used properly.",1
"Some students love to do extra things in life like sports or things dealing with school like yearbook or student council. But there are cons that needs be brought into light about these extracurricular activities. The principle want his students to achieve in extra activities that they like, but this goal can effect his students in many different ways. Some kids might find extracurricular activities fun while others dont, so the cons about having extra activities are more work, less family time, and very exhausting.

The first problem about these activities are that some students might not get enough sleep. If a student signs up for yearbook or student council then it causes them to stay up for a extended amount of time. Its not healthy for a student to stay up late because when its time for school then they might fall asleep in one of their classes, and they could miss out on important notes and guidelines.

Secondly, extra activities can take away family time. Family time is very important because you might not want to miss out on great things. If a students main focus is on running for student council or any sports they like then family wouldnt be the main concern. Since these students are being told to do these activities it might not affect many others in the same way because not every student wants to sign up for something. A good outcome of a student working on something dealing with a school activity is that there family can be included to help them out.

Finally, The last concern is that students will have extra work. It would be difficult because teachers already give students loads of school work they want to be accomplished. So, since there is lots of work bring given out, extracurricular activities can add lots of stress onto students because they are going to want all their work finished.

Students should be able to do whatever they want because not every student is good at sports or making detailed essays for student council. So, students should be able to choose if they want to be apart in any act of the schools activities because if they are not getting enough sleep, enough family time, and getting extra work then these activities should only be offered to the ones that want to do sports and many other things, instead of making it mandatory. Also, everyone might not want to participate in a extracurricular activity because they might not have what they enjoy to do available.",0
"Gun control is a really important issue that affects lots of people. I think it's important to have stricter gun control laws because it can help keep people safe.

One reason is that guns can be really dangerous if they're not handled properly. There have been lots of cases where people have accidentally shot themselves or others, and stricter laws could help prevent this. For example, if there were stricter laws, people would have to go through proper training before they could buy a gun, and this would help them understand how to handle it safely.

Another reason is that guns can be used for bad things, like robberies or shootings. If it's harder for people to get guns, it's less likely that these things will happen. For example, in countries where gun control laws are strict, there are fewer gun-related crimes.

Finally, stricter gun control laws could help prevent things like mass shootings. These are really tragic events that can have a big impact on communities. If people didn't have access to guns, it would be less likely that these events would happen.

However, some people might argue that stricter gun control laws would infringe on their rights. They might say that people should be able to own guns for self-defense or hunting. But, I think it's important to consider the greater good. If stricter laws can help keep people safe, then it's worth it.

Overall, I think stricter gun control laws are a good idea. They can help keep people safe, prevent bad things from happening, and make communities better places.",1
"The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coincided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning carsreducing them will benefit our ecosystems and environments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing Source 2. That CO2 rises into the air, the atmosphere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of carpooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3 and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael siva brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine 19 and 21 speaking of her children have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the environment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the citytown. In Bogota, Columbia according to Source 3 new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the environment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and checkup like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.",0
"The Electoral College is a ""process"" ""between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (1). The Electoral Collage was created by the founding fathers and was written in the Constitution. The Electoral Collage should be kept instead of popular vote because the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who becomes President and it is chosen by a better educated person.

To start, the Electoral Collage helps in deciding who is gonna be the President.  ""Certainity of outcome, everyones President, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections"" (Posner). The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (18). ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (19). ""...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"" (20). ""So, other things being equal , a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" (21). ""The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (22).

Secondly, when voting for Electoral Collage ""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" (6). ""Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors"" (5). ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" (5).

Although the Electoral Collage sounds simple, there are some problems that occur. ""...According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage-- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (9). ""Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (10).

To conclude, the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who is becomes the President and it is chosen by a better educated person. ""Voters in a presidental elections are people who want to express a politcal preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election..."" (23).    ",0
"The Reason teachers do summer projects is so that students do not forget the things they learned during the school year. Some people may argue that summer projects should be teacher designed because if everyone has the same project then it should not be a problem. I know that argument is wrong because I have done both student and teacher designed and the student designed was much easier to work into my summer vacation than the teacher's project. Over the summer projects should be student designed because the student has more freedom to do what they want with the project.

Student designed projects helps the student because the student knows how to fit a project for summer vacation. During summer vacation a student does not worry about his or her schoolwork they have learned during the year. I was a kid that had summer camps that took up the entire day, but since I had a student designed project I was able to finish it earlier. The student designed projects give more room for students to finish early and be creative. This freedom the student designed projects give is why teacher designed projects is a worse choice.

Some people seem to think that since all the students get the same project when its teacher designed that the project is easier to complete. Teacher designed projects do not account for any job/summer camp that the student would be doing. The projects also ignores the chance that a student could be travelling to visit relatives for an extended time. Teacher designed projects are typically time consuming, harder, and leave less room for creativity. The students working on the project would be less likely to work on it since the subject the students are given are not interesting to them. I know this because in 7th grade many kids did not turn in their summer reader assignment because they were either too busy or too unintrested in the subject entirely.

Students given the over the summer projects should be able to design the project because there is more freedom and interest in the project itself. People that disagree could say it's easier because the project was made by a teacher, but the same people do not account for interest, summer jobs, summer camps, or any other activity that would take time away from school work. If students had control over the summer projects then even their grades would be boosted.",0
"Dear Principle, if students have to have at least a B average to play sports then all the people that are good at sports with a C will not be able to help out the school team. Some student may not even stay in school if they cant play sports it could be the only thing keeping them motivated to make good grades and stay in school. A lot of student make C' s and a C is still passing, if C is the best they can do and their trying then they should be able to stay on the school sports team. If you only allow students to play a sport with a B or higher then you might not even get enough students for a whole team and if you do they may not be to good at the sport. One student may be outstanding at a sport but if you don't let them play because they don't have a B they could possibly get angry and start fights and disrespect teachers and eventually get expelled. For some students that may love sports might not be able to make a B to save there life, eventually the school rates will go down and we could become the worst school in the state. Parents might start pulling there children out and transferring them, or home schooling just so they could play a sport with a D or a C not A or B. Sports to some students are the most important thing to them and then you just take it away from them because they don't have a B or higher, how do you think that makes them feel.",0
"Imagination can be an incredibly powerful tool for achieving success. It enables us to go beyond our known boundaries and explore possibilities that we had not considered before. Imagination allows us to dream, devise plans, and think outside the box. In short, it gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new and make it happen.

Take the example of Elon Musk, who envisioned a world in which electric cars become the norm and space exploration was feasible for everyone. Through his imagination he was driven to build the electric car company Tesla and SpaceX. His successful vision was made possible by his ingenious imagination rather than sheer knowledge.

On the other hand, knowledge is important in the process of achieving success, however, without imagination, it is unlikely that this knowledge can be leveraged effectively. Knowledge without creativity and imagination is like driving a car without a destination. It's essential to understand the science behind what we are creating, but without creative ideas to guide us, all the knowledge in the world is useless.

In summary, imagination is just as important as knowledge when it comes to achieving success. It gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new, explore uncharted territory, and extend the boundaries of what is possible. Without imagination, knowledge alone cannot be leveraged effectively to manifest the desired dreams and ambitions.",1
"Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home.

While many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary.

To begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to her country for visiting. Furthermore, some students are working full time in summer to have a provision for their consumption in the future such as buying a car, college,etc. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager.

In addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they don't want the student to forget the information that they have learn. Students didn't expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students.

As a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. For long summer break teacher don't give homework, and students feel free to plan out their vacation for entire summer. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break.",0
"In 1976 NASA captured a picture of a landform on Mars . The landform resembeld a blurred face . Many people beleive that this martian ""face "" was created by aliens . However these theories have proven to be false with photos, and common logic.

Since the first sighting of the face more photos have been taken . Each new picture is clearer than the last . A photo taken in the year of 2001 shows the face to be a landform and nothing else . In fact the face is a mesa which is a common landform in the American West.

Some critics support theories that NASA is hiding the knowledge of life on Mars. It would be a giant step in discovery and extremely exciteing if these ideas came to be true but unfortunatly they haven't .

Despite the many theories that surround the face, the face isn't a face at all (though it would be cool if it actually was

"Cars nowadays are a big part of our lifes, they take us to where we need to go and help us go to far away places. Even though cars are important in our lifes, there are lot of advantages to limited car usage. Some places such as VAUBAN, Germany have given up their cars. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" This results in less people owning or having cars and reducing green house gas emissions from tailpipe. ""passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gases emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" source 1. Private ownership of cars are slowly choking our cities, if we limit our car usage little by little it may have a huge effect in our ecosystem.

In continuation, there have been situations where the air pollution got so bad that they had to ban driving so they could clear the air. For example in Paris, ""after days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city""source 2. The drivers were fined a 22euro fine if they did not leave their cars at home. In the end the smog cleared and the French party recinded the ban for oddnumbered plates. This is one of the many examples that proves that just by having less cars driving around it eventually changes the way the atmosphere looks and cleans the atmosphere a little.

Smog is a sign of high air pollution, it indicates that the air is not healthy and this can be harmful to our environment. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" As indicated in the passagesource 3, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", just one day without cars can reduce smog imagine if we go weeks without a huge number of cars driving around. This idea might sound crazy to some people but it has surprisingly helped the environment. This however is not the only advantage of reducing car usage. Some other advantages are that if we go to our jobs in a bike everyday or just go for a walk instead of a drive we are also being more productive and active, hence making us healthier.

Although some people might find leaving their cars behind is a bad idea, studies have shown that people who do so gets used to the idea and find less reason to resume the habit of car commuting. For example instead of driving to the beach we should ride our bikes or take public busses to get there. Without cars we learn to appreciate the beauty of nature more and notice things about the place were we live that we have never seen before. I have came to notice that when you are driving you really dont notice things because you are to busy focusing on the road, but when u have a walk around your neighborhood or anywhere for that matter you see things you have never noticed before and you leaarn to appreciate nature more. The idea of leaving our cars behind is hard for some people, but if you think about the effect it will have on the environment it is worth it.

In conclusion, carfree cities might sound like a joke to some people but it is helping out in clensing our environment increasingly. As indicated in the passage, ""The End Of Car Culture"", ""If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of Americas emissions, just behind power plants."" We are responsible for how our environment is going to look like in the future years, wouldnt it be better for it to look like a beautiful clear sunny day or a foggy grey fuss? Quiting a habit like driving is very hard but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",0
"Principal:

I think that bring your phone to school and using them at lunch, break and other free times is a good idea. Because as long as they turn it off at the end of the time giving then there should be no problem. I know you probably think that people would go behind your back and leave there phones on but if they do and they get caught they should get in trouble for it. I really don't see a problem with taken your phone to school and using it at free time.

Also, if they don't obey the rules then they can pay the consequences.

Using phones at school is not no big deal if you think about it. Because we have eight hour in school and I think it is right if you let us use it when free time is giving to us, but not during class time. I know school means a lot but i still think we should get a free time and let us check our phones. School is not a joke, it is important i know that, but i bet you over half of the school checks there phones when they can.

In all, i think students should be allowed to use there phones when they have free time. Education is very important, but remember we have eight hours in school and I don't see any problem checking them at lunch, break or free time. i don't think its right sneaking behind your back and people trying to check there phone so instead of them going behind your back the free time giving to them they can check it.

Thanks,

"Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME

i am here today to tell you why we should not be able to come to school with cell phones. The reason why we should not come to school with cell phones to school because of low test scores, lack of participation, and most importantly fights occur on school campus yes fights. let get started principal TEACHER_NAME.

First, let me start by saying this are school are one of the lowest schools that have low test grades because of phones. Phones in school is a bad idea because when students are in class they don't pay any attention to the class assignments they worry about when there going to get there next text or phone call. I had went to go check out most of these students grades and most of them are failing because there phones are always turn on like for example a student name RELATIVE_NAME

was in class taking a test he wasn't doing his test he was on the phone texting we seriously need to do some thing.

Second, lack of participation is one of the biggest problem in school if nobody want to do any work what's the point of coming to school. Principal TEACHER_NAME participation put point on your current grade if more student participate they have a chance increasing there grade to something higher. Students don't understand that were trying to get them to success if more students can participate i guarantee you this the school test scores will increase. memorial middle school increase there test scores cause of participation and i know we can do it too

Third, most importantly fight are occurring fast at this school a lot of students are getting suspended because, of phone drama that are in school they text when and where there going to fight and that i can not have any violence on this school campus. A lot of students are getting arrested for battery or physical battery i want theses student to learn not to fight cause of what some one else think of her if we can take those phone away i guarantee this school would be the best school in the county for example one of the students just got into a fight because of a phone over a phone are you kidding me. Principal TEACHER_NAME you see what im talking about.

inconclusion principal TEACHER_NAME

i have convince you why we need to take phones away because of low test scores, lack of participation and most and importantly school fights . Now since the problem had been solve let me go announce this first thing in the morning thank you. HAVE A GOOD DAY!",0
"Dear senator in the sources ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defences of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer  and also ""In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, the authors of the article discuss the pros and cons to having an electoral college. The citizens of the United States would be more pleased if the electoral college stayed as opposed to it being ebolished.

To begin, having a electoral college will be better for the nation and people.

for example, the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president"" the article states ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is very possible- it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" this claim provides a true statement on reasons why we should keep the electoral college. This statement means that disputes are less likely with their method and their is a certainty of an outcome.

Although keeping the electoral college is a valid idea, there are some problems associated with keeping the electoral college as well. Of course, there are difficulties with in the curcumstsance where we keep the Electoral Collage opposed to disspose of it. the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Plumer made several claims opposing of the electoralcollege, such claims include ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"" and opinons like ""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irration"". While Plumer did put his point across as to how the system is unfair we must take into consideration how it is more reasonable and appropriate, in ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" the article states that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" which is fair and less stressful.

in summary, the best option would to keep the way things are rather than changing things up and and creating a more stressful, unorganized system. Although Plumer made accurate claims as to some of the faults in the system, there was far more proof in keeping the electoral college and keeping things the same.                                                    ",0
"Graduating high school in three years instead of four can be a difficult decision to make for a student and their family. While some may view this decision as simply saving a year of schooling, there are a variety of factors to consider, including workload, cost, and potential future opportunities. 

First, the workload. Graduating high school in three years would likely require students to take more courses in a shorter amount of time. This would make it especially difficult for students who may struggle academically or those who are involved in competitive extracurriculars. Additionally, this could also impede the quality of a student’s academic performance, considering the shorter time to complete each class. 

Second, the cost. Graduating in three years would likely require students to pay extra for the extra classes or accelerated courses. Families may also be burdened by the additional costs, such as textbooks, tuition and transportation fees. 

Finally, the opportunities. It is fair to critique that choosing the three-year option may limit a student’s opportunities in the future. Although this decision has the potential to shave a year off of a high school career, college acceptance is generally dependent on credits completed and the courses taken. In addition, students who do not take the traditional four-year route may find it difficult to stand out among competitors who are more experienced in their fields. 

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years instead of four is a decision that should not be taken lightly. Both of the options have advantages and disadvantages which must be considered before a student makes the right decision that best suits their needs.",1
"Does asking for peoples advice on a matter help you or does it make the situation worse.

Well I believe that asking for some advice can have its pros and cons.

For example one pro can be that by asking for someone advice it can open up more ideas on the problem that plagues your mind, but a con can be that by adding a new idea into the situation, it could build up more stress and anxiety to get it done or solve the problem.

But I think in all honesty that getting more opinions can be good and make it easier for you to make best choice.

By listening to others opinions, the choice you have may broaden allowing you to make the best choice.

Which in turn could lead to more and more good choices in your future.

Another reason why asking for other peoples opinions, is that everyone has a different opinion, therefore has different ways to solve the same problem.

Trying to solve things on your own can lead to a complete disaster, so asking for others help can really make things less stressful and easier for you.

Also by asking for others opinions you can build trust between you an the people you ask.

By building more and more relationships, you have more and more people to talk to about your problems and can help you fix them.

When listening to other peoples opinion there maybe things you don't agree with, but you don't need to completely dismiss the idea instead you can let them finish voicing the idea then give your own spin to it.

By listening and not stopping them, you have helped to build your patience, listening skills, and your possible choices in the situation.

So you see by asking for others opinion you can, build new and better relationships, relieve stress, build important social skills, and see the bigger picture to choose the best course of action.                      ",0
"The cell phone policy at school should be fair to students and teacher's. By this i mean that students should be able to use there cell phones at appropriate times without disrupting other students.

I support the policy number two, because students can meet with other kids to maybe study in the library or go get a bite to eat by just simply sending a text message other then going out looking for them all over campus. The only thing is that each student would have to shut OFF his or her phone before they enter a building or else the phone will be confiscated by the teacher. This way there will be no distractions. The policy of number two is understanding, because students don't need there cell phones for emergency's because there's a phone in the class room that the teachers would be happy for you to use but sometimes students wont be in the classroom for an emergency then what's going to happen? Phones are a big distraction and should be just turned off till the end of school.      ",0
"I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other

.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. Okay this off the topic that we are talking about okay, all most every billoner drop of of school and collage to start what they wanted to do and what there dream was the did not stop it they all went for it

Okay now this is back on the topic. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .

Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.",0
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For this essay, I had to research the pros and cons of graduating early from high school, and I gotta say, it's pretty interesting stuff.

First off, let's talk about the advantages of graduating early. One of the biggest benefits is that you get to start college or your career earlier than your peers. Like, imagine being able to skip that awkward freshman year of college and start your dream job right away! It's like, you get to skip the waiting game and get straight to the good stuff. Plus, you'll have more time to focus on your passions and interests without having to worry about school. 🎉

Another advantage is that you'll have more time to travel and explore the world. Like, imagine being able to backpack through Europe or Asia before you even turn 18! You'll have so much more freedom and flexibility to do whatever you want. And who knows, you might even discover new cultures and experiences that will help you in the long run. 🌏

However, there are also some pretty big disadvantages to graduating early. One of the biggest is that you might miss out on important social experiences. Like, you won't get to hang out with your friends and classmates as much, and you might feel left out of important events and activities. And let's be real, high school is a big part of our lives, and missing out on it can be kinda sad. 😔

Another disadvantage is that you might not be emotionally ready for the challenges of college or the workforce. Like, you might not have the maturity and independence to handle the demands of higher education or the workplace. And if you're not careful, you might end up struggling to keep up or even failing. 😩

So, in conclusion, graduating early from high school can have both advantages and disadvantages. It's important to weigh the pros and cons carefully and think about what's best for you. If you're mature and responsible enough to handle the challenges, then it might be a great opportunity for you. But if you're not,",1
"Every four years there is an election held for the next president. Citizens across America vote for the canidate they best see fit to be president. Many may not know but there is another process other than voting to select a president. When people vote for a president, they are actually voting for a elector. That elector then votes for the next president, and this is called The Electral College System. The Electoral College System should no no longer be part of the election process, but instead have election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

When a president is elected it does not just effect the government, but also the people of America. The president that is chosen makes decisions for the people, and that is why so many people vote on who will be making those decisions. The Electoral College System greatly effects that vote of presidency. In The Indefensible Electrol Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Pradford Plumer states that ""Voters vote not fo the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the persident"". People are not getting the chance to vote, because the electors are the ones voting for them. The people should have a turn to vote for the next president.

Many people today are all toward the Electoral College System. People think that it is a great way and very helpful when it comes to the elections. The Electorical College seems fair to some people, even if the president most voted for was not elected like back in 2000. The electors to them help find a new president with other electors in Congress. The electors even have the chance to vote for the other canidate even if the people do not vote for that canidate.

However many people may be towards the system, but others are also against it. The electors go to Congress and vote for the next president. It is even possible that the canidate most voted for by the people could not be voted for by the electors. The electos haave the finall sya, even if that means not voting for who the people are voting for. This is an issue that should no longer be, but instead have popular vote.

The Electoral College Sysytem should be removed from the presidential election, and replaced with popular vote. The Electoral College System does not help, but prevents the canidate most voted for to be ellected. Popular vote from the people should decide who the next president of the United States should be.                                                                                                                                            ",0
"I do agree with this decision for many reasons. Extracurricular activities can be very benefiting in many different ways. First, off you can meet new people and make new friends. Second, you can learn a new sport/skill from this activity depending on what you are doing. Also depending on what you decide to do your skill could benfit others like the yearbook. There are many reasons that extracurricular activities can help.

Extracurricular activities can introduce to new people. You can meet new people and get to know other people a little bit more. There are many types of people and if you want to meet other people who do the same things you can pick that activity. For example if you wanted to meet people who play basketball you can try out for the basketball team or if you wanted to meet people who like music you can join the band. There are also many ways to get to know familiar faces a little better. You are doing something you like while meeting people that you could like or already do. Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people.

You could learn a new sport/skill from what you do. For example you have always been really in to computers but you decide you like soccer you could join the soccer team. You would be learning how to play a sport you have never tried before. You could also want to join the photography club you would be able to learn how to use a camera and download photos to a computer. There is always something new to learn and you should always go the extra mile to learn something. Extracurricular activities are a great way to learn.

You could also benifit others from what you are doing for example student council helps everybody because of all the things that they do for the school itself. Any club or team can help in a way like winning a championship brings pride to the school or the yearbook club who put together all of the best memories throughout the year. Everyone can help in their own way no matter how big or small each club helps others.

Every club in benefiticial and should be used to help others and learn. They help you meet new people and try new things. Everything can help you and that is why I do agree with his decisions for everyone to join a club because of all the benefits it can have for you. Some people don't like to be that social but they should still join an extracurricular activity because in the long run it will help them out a lot. Extracurricular activies are going to help everyone in one way or another.",0
"I disagree with the decision made by our principal that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While I understand the importance of being involved in extracurricular activities, I believe that forcing students to participate in something they may not be interested in can have negative consequences.

Firstly, not all students have the same interests or abilities. Some students may not enjoy sports, while others may not have the necessary skills to participate in certain activities. Forcing them to participate in something they don't enjoy or aren't good at can lead to a negative experience, which may discourage them from participating in any extracurricular activities in the future.

Secondly, some students may have other commitments or responsibilities that prevent them from participating in extracurricular activities. For example, they may have to work to support their family, take care of younger siblings, or attend to personal matters. Forcing them to participate in an activity they don't have time for can add unnecessary stress to their already busy lives.

Lastly, mandatory participation in extracurricular activities can take away from the joy of voluntary participation. When students are forced to participate in something, it can feel like a chore rather than a fun activity. This can lead to a lack of enthusiasm and engagement, which can negatively impact the overall experience for everyone involved.

Instead, I believe that students should have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities. This allows them to pursue their interests and passions, and to participate in activities that they genuinely enjoy. It also gives them the opportunity to learn new skills, make new friends, and develop their confidence and character.

In conclusion, while I understand the importance of extracurricular activities, I disagree with the decision to make participation mandatory. I believe that students should have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to participate, and that this will lead to a more positive and fulfilling experience for everyone involved.",1
"With the technology that we are capable of using to create a spaceship to have astronomers study Venus from a distance and gather information is a massive jump leading to a future where more than likely NASA could get a better understanding on our sister planet.

With deeper knowledge of a planet so similar to earth, it could really boost us and lead to bigger andvancements such as creating rovers or spaceships that can sustain Venus' enviorment for more than just a couple of weeks. With an ability to have rovers or spaceships that can sustain the enviorment, NASA can get a better understanding and get more evidance so that deeper, and more complex studies on Venus can be taken part in. With an advancement in technology in spacecrafts, scientists can achieve better understanding of the planet and its atmospere, Scientist can get more complex answers and evidance on the age of the planet, and its atmospheric pressure. Due to so little data or lack of technology to get more advanced studies of the planet, it has been difficult to get more answers than what we already have.

"In life all of us suffer many trials and obstacles of different extremes. As humans a normal way to deal with these trials is to look to someone for comfort and advice. Whether that may be many people or just one person it is usually someone we confide in with our thoughts and someone that can confide in us to be able to tell the truth. At times, we may find it better to talk to more than one person when asking for advice. We may go to one person to get an outside opinion on the situation. By getting this outside opinion this person may not necessarily be biased to one side of the story and it gives this person a chance to be truthful. You may also go to someone who has a different way of thinking as you, someone with a different mindset. This person could bring up new points to you and new sides of the situation to open up your mind to new possibilities. There might also be someone who has a similar way of thinking as you that could help you reassure and understand your thoughts and emotions. Another reason why you may go to a different person is just to vent. By simply telling this person everything thats going on it could help you organize thoughts in your own head. You may not look for this person for advice but someone to be there to listen to you while you figure out how you want to move forward in the situation. By expressing your feelings to this one person it could help you organize and address thoughts in your own head. By asking for advice from multiple people it could help you explore different mindsets, get an outside unbiased opinion, and give you a chance to express and organize your thoughts and emotions.

At times in stressful situations or in situations where you simply need advice it may be better to talk to a distant friend or an adult who isn't exactly in the loop of things that are happening in your life. Talking to someone to get an outside opinion could help because this person doesn't know all parts of the story or maybe doesn't know everybody involved personally. This is helpful because they have no sense of bias on who is involved and what is happening in the situation. This person isn't going to sugar coat their words and tell you the truth even if it's something that you don't want to hear. They may simply listen to what you have to say and will already be ready to introduce to you new opinions and will help you look at it from a different perspective. They may tell us the truth to address the things we may be avoiding in the situation such as something that is right or wrong. This helps us because sometimes we need to hear the truth to see why we are right or wrong in these situations. By hearing the truth and possibly getting advice to move forward you get to move forward with all your facts laid out.

Another type of person that you may seek for advice is someone who you know has a different mindset than you and maybe even someone who has a similar mindset than you. By talking to someone who has an opposing mindset as yours they will be able to give you new perspectives and new ways at looking at the situation. It may not always be a positive mindset but it's good to look at the negatives just as much as the positives. This persons different way of thinking and looking at things may introduce new and different ideas on how you should move forward and how you should address the situation. You may also seek someone who has a similar way of thinking as you. Theres always a possibility of this person help you discover new thoughts and information but this person will also assure you about the thoughts youre already having and make you feel better about them. They will give you this sense of reassurance it will help you move forward confidently and effectively.

The last type of person you may seek for advice is someone who is a good listener. This person will listen to everything you have to say and will just let you vent all your emotions and that may be the only advice they give you to just vent. This person will not only listen but support you on your choices and on what you have to say no matter what. By venting to this person it could help you organize your thoughts by simply expressing them all out loud. It is likely that it may even help you come to realizations you hadn't come to before. This person is very important when going through this stressful process of not knowing what to do of getting that reassurance that everybody needs from time to time. This person may or may not be the best person for advice but they are really good of being there when you need them and listening to you when you are going through a stressful. By expressing and addressing these thoughts it could help you move forward content with your thoughts and confident on your decisions.

In conclusion, I think that by seeking more than one person for advice it helps you get the support you need to make new and smart choices. Different people that are helpful to seek advice from is someone who is more of an outside opinion because they tell you the truth and dont sugar coat their thoughts. If you seek someone who has a different mindset they will introduce new ways of thinking and different approaches you could take in the situation.

By expressing all your feelings, thoughts, and emotions you are letting someone know how you feel and getting the support you need to move forward confidently. By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally. I personally believe that when someone asks multiple people for advice it and seeking multiple opinions it helps them be able to make smart and rational choices while being confident with their choice and content with their thoughts and emotions.                                                           ",0
"Dear Principal,

My opinion i believe that we the students should be able to have are phones at school. I think that they should be shut of during the classes , but however at lunch the students should be aloud to use them to call parents for emergency uses. The students have the right to bring there cell phones to school it is not hurting anybody. i could understand why you are considering making the policy so that we can not have are cell phones , in some cases you may think that it is interfering with our learning but most of the students will be responsible and keep there phone in there back packs turned off.

Most of the students have to walk to and from school and some live in bad parts of town so there parents have them when they call when they get to school or when they leave from school.

There are many other purposes why students need to have there cell phones at school, but these are just the ones that i felt were most important.

Thank You.",0
"Online teaching has a been a staple for an advancement,not only for technology but education. Progression has been pushed further through the recognition of technology and it's impact on everyday life. Due to the increase in usefulness of phones and laptops education has been reforming itself to adjust to said changes by implementing itself in technologies wide range. I agree with the idea of online courses and video conferences would benefit students. Change is required to excel in all things including education and its usefulness such as manageability,efficiency,and one on one teaching.

An online course isn't restricted to a daily schedule and due to that you can schedule classes that work with your availability or when your less busy. Some people are restricted by travel for education which could either be it's costly or the schools locally aren't very good for them while online schooling has no need for travel. So if someone wants to do a specific job that isn't taught in their area they can take online courses. The availability of online courses is one of it's most praised features thanks to it being able to be done anywhere such as:Cafes,on the road,hotels for if your on vacation,etc. An online course would be a benefit for someone who has large priorities like the military or an athlete due to them having to move a lot.

Online courses are productive for work being done;due to online course allowing work to be done anywhere,anytime. While doing school at a public facility is filled with mistakes such as teachers misplacing work or procrastinating to deal with grades. An online course can hold onto your grades so you or your teacher never misplace them. Classes are far easier to take online as well because, your able to take a multitude of classes that may not be focused on locally. While taking online courses you have the ability to focus on other things as well without the foreshadowing of work that needs to be done,as stated with athletes they can worry about practice and training without worrying for having to get ready for classes and running back and forth.

Video calls have been an extraordinary leap in technology while also influencing education. Video conferences are the best opportunity for one on one teaching and it's ability of privacy. You can be able to have your teacher show you the way to execute problems and solve them while being able to answer your questions you may have. Being taught by someone is experience needed for growth and its exceptionally helpful for comprehending a subject you may struggle with. The privacy and seclusion of online courses is beneficial for a less embarrassing experience if you struggle with a question which can boost confidence in the long run.

An Online course is a thing students should take advantage of when given the chance due to its usefulness. Technology and education are moving forward,creating more ways for a student to learn and comprehend their interests. Time and willingness to learn are the things needed for education and the ability to excel in it. Video conferences are the best way to have a subject unfold before you and to understand it properly while having the ability to have your teacher there for you. Online courses will always be needed for someone is excessively busy or unable to travel as much,so they will always be need.",0
"Dear Principal,

I remember when I was a little girl my dad would take me to go the park every Sunday to pick up litter. He would always tell me ""It's very important to help out your community.""

Now he works on the weekends but, I still go every Sunday. There are so many reasons to do community service. It help the community you live in, it can teach you new things, also it shows you what things are really important.

It helps your community more then people realize. The little actions can influence other people and eventually become bigger actions. It also helps our planet, by picking up litter your helping to stop and animal from chocking on it. Also if you help paint a neighborhood and clean it up then the people will be happier too. With happier people just makes it a better place to live in.

It can teach you new things. You could learn how to make things out of recycled cans, paper, anything. It will teach you that community service helps everybody rather then just yourself. Nobody just does it and never learns anything or nobody would ever do it. It can teach you how to make other people happy and make things better for everybody.

Community service shows you some things that are actually important in life. Rather then the new shows on T.V. Nobody likes to live in a dirty place so it can show you how to keep things clean. You could start a tradition like my dad did with me, you could do it with a family member or friends. It shows you how to put other people before yourself and how to make others happy. You will learn new things every time you go.

All in all community service is a great way to show people many things. They could help their community, learn new things, or even find out what's really important in life. Without community service the parks would be discussing, there would probably be more wrecked neighborhoods which nobody wants to live in, life wouldn't be as beautiful. Community service isn't hard to do, it just takes a little effort. So Principal you see why it is so very important to have community service mandatory in schools. Life would change without it.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system in place for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe the Electoral College provides several essential benefits that should be considered before any changes are made.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College method produces a clear winner, which reduces the likelihood of disputes over the result. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only received 51.3% of the popular vote. This demonstrates how the Electoral College allows for a decisive victory and helps avoid ongoing disputes that could arise in a popular vote system.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" Judge Posner highlights that the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal prevents a candidate with only regional support from winning. This is crucial because it ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions and avoids making certain regions feel disenfranchised. By appealing to voters across various regions, candidates are incentivized to address diverse interests and concerns, leading to a more balanced and representative presidency.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. In the article by Judge Posner, he explains how the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. By giving swing states a significant role in deciding the election, the Electoral College ensures that campaigns are not focused solely on densely populated areas while neglecting the concerns of smaller, less populous states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to the political system by giving weight to large states. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate outlined in the Constitution already disadvantages larger states. By awarding electoral votes based on state population, the Electoral College offsets some of this political imbalance. This way, candidates are forced to pay attention to the larger states in their campaign strategies, ensuring that the interests of all states, regardless of size, are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. Without the Electoral College, there is a higher possibility of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Avoiding run-off elections simplifies the presidential election process and ensures a clear winner is determined without further complications.

Although some criticize the Electoral College for potentially disenfranchising voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout remains strong despite this. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, about half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, even though they knew their single vote would not sway the final outcome. This demonstrates that voters participate in elections to express their political preferences rather than solely to influence the result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, equitable representation, and a balanced campaign focus, while also preventing run-off elections. These factors make a compelling case for maintaining the current system for electing the President of the United States. I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and support its continuation.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will make the decision that best serves the interests of our great nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The idea of a four-day work week with ten hour days is gaining traction in the business world - and for good reason. Many studies suggest that this type of schedule can maximize productivity and energy levels while reducing fatigue and increasing employee satisfaction. In terms of energy use, the compact time frame of this type of arrangement means that less energy is consumed overall. In addition, employees often report feeling more motivated and refreshed due to the additional day off. This can increase productivity, as employees have more time to rest and recharge. While the five day work week is the more traditional option, the four day work week with ten hour days has the potential to bring benefits to both the employer and the employee.",1
"Driving with a phone isn't always a bad thing, sometimes people have a valid reason to be driving with their phone and aren't always trying to just goof around. Like, for example, when I drive, I have to use my phone whenever my mom or dad call me or I have to call my mom to tell her if I have practice or not after school.

Most people don't have newer cars that have built-in GPS, or even a touch screen which means they have to use their phone if their driving out of town and need a GPS or need to use their phone to contact a friend or family member to make sure there in the correct places to get where they're going.

Last year during soccer season, I had to call my mom in order to let her know if our practice was ever cancelled or ask her to bring me food before the game, which meant she was using her phone while driving home after work, but was for a good reason. My mom has an older car that has a touch screen put into, it but she still has to take her eyes off the road to answer the phone on the touch screen which is just like using her phone, so what's the point of her not being able to use her phone?

The average cost of a 2018-19 car is about twenty to thirty thousand dollars and even though they come with a built in touch screen, the average American can't afford a newer model car. This means they get a touch screen built in, if possible, but even using a touch screen can be as distracting as a phone. This shouldn't make people who have to use their phone a bigger target than someone who is using a touch screen who could be doing ever knows what. So using a phone while driving shouldn't be something worthy of being pulled over for.

True texting and driving seems bad and is the cause of about every car wreck. Most people still text and drive, but they focus their attention mainly on the road when driving or they use it while at a stop sign or on an open road. Texting while driving shouldn't be seen as such a big deal as long as you're at a complete stop while driving due to the fact that you can't always pull over to somewhere safe to use your phone if you're heading somewhere new for the first time.

Over all, texting while driving isn't something you should always do, but shouldn't be something you be fined $50 dollars for. If anything, it should just be at most for the first offence $15, and after that $25. Everyone has used their phone at least once while driving since the hands-free law was passed. Most people who didn't follow the law were probably using their phone for something important, others maybe not. But, when texting and driving, you should always be aware of your surroundings and try to use it when you're at a complete stop or able to pull over.

"I would prefer having more people because you would get more point of views. You Also don't know the things a person as been through, like for instant. Say a person went through a bad time in life and you wanna learn how to get through it. You wouldn't talk to someone who's trying to tell you how hard jobs are, you would want to talk to someone who's been in your shoes before. It's just better that way, and you will have more then just one person to help you make a good Choice.

whether it's sports, work or school even just life its self. That's my honest opinion. Also To be honest.

what is the worst that could happen. All you would get is Extra Point of views on how to take on the Situation and extra opinions. You might love or hate thats why you have to ask more then one person. Thats why you need to indulge yourself in more people so they can give you more opportunities.",0
"Driveless cars are not safe enough yet to be on the roads. First, there are no completly driveless cars yet just cars that assisit. There are too many problems driveless cars could bring up with the law. There are too many saftey issues that could happen with driveless cars. So, are driveless cars really coming?

As of today there are no completly driveless cars out. There are only cars that can assist with driving. It will be awhile before driveless cars are out on the roads. Even cars that are just assisting are not safe. Assisting cars are very limited in assisting for saftey reasons.

What happens if a driveless car gets into an accident, is it the dirvers fault or the manufacter? This could bring up many legal problems. There would be many lawsuits against the manufacturing companies. Also, the laws would have to change for driveless cars.

A lot of people would assume that their car is in control, so most likley many of them would not pay attention to the road. Many accidents would happen this way. Putting cameras in cars to asssure that people are paying attention to the road would be an invasion of privacy.

Driveless cars may be a thing of the future. Driveless cars are not a thing of today. Too many legal issues would arise. Driveless cars bring too many saftey issues. No, driveless cars will not be coming anytime soon.               ",0
"The  Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers were;not always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electorals confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guarenteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the elcectoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candiates focus more on those staes to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.    ",0
"I belive my claim for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions are invading our private space. What i'm trying to say is what if they computer says the wrong things or if we feel something that could be embarrasing or offended it'll cause us to either become more emotional or angry/offended. I believe you will also be taking jobs of those who have went to college to major in this type of senarios. If you are taking all of this for people to have it on a computer software then you are no better than hispanics or immagrants taking people jobs because it'll lessen the chance of people even knowing or wanting to become in their life. Yes we need to advance technology to better help people but,people still have their rights and beliefs and you would be crossing the line in my opinion if you were to believe this idea. I say let the professionals handle it who are in some ways the same way cause the computers would be screening us humans when there are other professional humans to relate or more capable of helping someone than a software and if the system goes wrong then what will you guys do then? What i'm trying to say is just let people who can relate and have diplomas for this kind of stuff let them do their jobs and stop replacing humans with machines because it'll be another Great Depression coming to you.",0
"I thinks is decions of everyone because if you are smart and if you want to graduation in three year just you have to focuse and give your best and you have the decion in your hands if your decion is yes so do it, because another students can`t do it or din`t like, so i think is opecional, for my selfel i think is greet idea just take three year of the high school but i know is not easy becuase take the high school in three year is very complicate becuase you well have to take course duging the summers and may not be able to take elective couses, but you advance is good.

Reasons. (why is good)

becuase is good for you live because you have one year early and this can help you to do it a greet estudent and with this year early you can go to the college early or you can work one year and after this year you can star the college, and if your finis the high school in three year that mean you are a good estudent and thats can help you because you can find a programs that can help you, because if you want to go to the college the college is not chip and for follow your dream you have find a solucion and the solucion is give you best.

Example. Because if you find a programs that can help you, so you can follow what you want to do it in a future.

If you are a bad students and you GPA is so down you can`t go to the college becuase for going to college, I think you GPA have to do more the 3.00 for you can go a good callege.

Thats why I think is good take the high school in three year, because you can have more oportunidis for well have a good future.

Conclution.

Yes is good idea that students to finish high school in three years becuase is something like well better for you futuere, in your live. But everything is your decision you know what you want to do with life and if you don`t know what you want to do just think about in you future and thats you can find the enswer and belive in yourself that you can do it. because the education is very important.",0
"In Vauban Germany, the people in the suburbs have stopped driving. Parking or housing a car predominately prohibited and the only vehicle you'd see is the tram that take citizens from the edge of the community or to downtown Freiburg. You can own a car, but the parking space is incredibly limited, sometimes even expensive.

The residents aren't complaining. 57% of the population even had sold their car to live in Vauban, one woman even stating she felt less tense without a vehicle.

The growing trend of reducing automotive use in suburban lifestyles is a role in a movement known as ""smart planning."" Cars are often heavily populated in the suburbs, which hinders the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions, as up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US come from cars.

Many of the world is now slowly following Vauban's steps with actions like reducing the size of suburbs and and giving its residents more access to public transportation. Rather than creating distant malls along highways, stores are being placed on a main street that's a walk away.

In Paris, after dealing with a nearly record-high amount of smog, a driving ban was enforced to reduce and/or clear out the pollution. Public transit was free and the smog managed to clear enough that cars with odd-numbered plates were allowed to be put in use again.

Bogota, California also took part in a day without passenger vehicles, with only buses and taxis in commision. On Day Without Cars, 7 million people rode bikes, skated, hiked, or took a bus to their job. It's believed to help reduce pollution and reduce stress. Thanks to the day, parks and sport centers have appeared, sidewalks made smoother and broadened, rush-hour rules designed to cute traffic, and plenty of new shops and dining places within short distance.

Recents studies also appear reveal a decrease in car purchases as time passes, raising the question of America's interest in automotives and driving. As of 2013, an average person drove 9% below the peak, identical to where is was in 1995. While the price of cars is a factor taken into consideration, the decrease hopefully hints to a more permanent drop in car use.

With this comes a benificial lessen of carbon emmissions, conserve resources and improve safety. Only time will tell where it will go from here.    ",0
"By reading ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" I think to myself that they still need improvment. Now cars been around for a long time, but not that long for us to make a car that drives its self. People who drive right now are better off driving themself, I understand they think its cool and it will change the future, but there will be far more accidents then when people regularly drive. They even said that they need improvements such as not being able to go around accidents or off road, and even destruction workers. Now even though it drives its self which is cool you know but how would the car know if there is a stop sign or a red light, there will be an accident.

Now if cars cant see where a stop sign is and if its a red light or yellow light then there is no reason to make a driverless car. Thats like having a blind person walk across the street while they think its their living room. If the human driver has to be alerted if the car does something it was not suppose to do then they should wait 5 to 7 more years until they release it out to the public. Im no science guy or car dude but I know that it would take longer for a car to drive its self. Stick with normal cars.

The year 2020 is not far away in fact theres 4 more years until 2020 is upon us, thats not enough years to find out what is wrong with the car, fix it and find more problems and fix another one. Every car has problems with it but if your more focused on the car driving its self and accidently forget about the other things like the stock and perhaps a screw for the tire then well your screwed. Alot of people mess up on scooters and forget a part or two but thats nothing because they are easy to drive, but forgetting a part for a car, one that drives its self is dangerous for society. I get it we all make mistakes but that is not what people are going to think when one computer car crashes into a tree because it though it was a road. Then boom people say take away driverless cars.

While im on this computer typing i worry about the computer crashing. While i worry about that what do you think people will worry about when they are the road? They will be worried about dying or getting injured from a computer crashing. That gets me to my next topic, say your on a bike riding home and you hear a car right behind you, but you dont know it was a driverless car then the computer crashes and you get injured and you sue the person for not being careful but you should be suing google for not taking more time and making things better. Then google loses everything because they lost the coart battle.

There are planes that the government has been working on for a very long time, and there are still problems with it. I understand nothing is perfect but dont take the chance to make a car to drive its self and when it messes up people blame the company because people look at it like that. They aint use to it. They are use to regular cars that people can drive in. People see crashes all the time because its usually one of the drivers that dont know what they are doing. When they see that it was a driverless car the car is going to get blamed and the people who didnt take their time in their project.   ",0
"Twenty five years ago a face was discovered on mars. NASA said that it was a rock that resembles a face. The rock had the look of eyes, nose, and a head. This is something that NASA and us scientist have never seen before. NASA hasn't figured out if it really is a face or just a rock. The face theory's do not make any scince.

The face has become an icon as it has made apperences in movies, books, and magazines. Many scientist have thought that the cause of the face was because of aliens. Then NASA wanted to figure out what it was so they sent a Orbiter Camera. They found out that there was no alien resemblence at all. The face was very hard to find. As it states in the article ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was wunter in April '98 a cloudy time of year"" (page 8, Unmasking the Face on Mars).

""It's not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. ""In fact it's hard work"" (page 9, Garvin). The face was hard to detect and took a lot of work to figure out what it really is. Scientist are still doing research on the face shaped rock. They are even sending space crafts with camera's to take pictures of the face. So far, they are not having any luck on getting a picture that isn't blurry. The face has become one of the most interesting and confusing things in science and still hasn't been solved today. ",0
"Cars, the pride and joy of many people. They may look nice and go fast, but they hurt the environment more than most people would know. If Americans in certain places used public transit or walked, air pollution would go down by 50% in those areas. It would be better for the environment, and for the human body's health to reduce the amount they drive in their personal car.

To begin, cars are the second most cause of air pollution in the United States behind power plants. Since the end of World War II the U.S.A has been idolizing cars, and they have been focusing on the production of these cars. In Vauban, Germany there is a ratio of 3 to 10 people who own cars. Only 30% of the population owns a car, which is saving the air from quite a bit of pollution. Another event that will help lower pollution would be banning driving cars for a day or two. In Paris, there was so much smog that it was compared and even rivaled Beijing, China; which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The people who drove their cars on this day would be fined $31 American dollars. The public transit was free of charge because it was being promoted to use, as it helps the air become less polluted. This event also happened in three Colombian cities, Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar. The ban on the cars made many people seem to be happier, and more energetic. This ban has been happening for three years now in Bogota, and other Latin American cities are now seeing the importance of it. The use of bicycles, the public transit, or even walking helps reduce air pollution in your city.

In addition to not using personal cars, walking from jobs or to the mall has seemed to make many people in these driving bans less stressful and much happier. From government officials to the commonfolk of the street, all of the Colombians in Bogota look much happier. Even rain hasn't stopped them from biking to work. One woman in Vauban, Heidrun Walter, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She does not own a car and lives a happy life. She even sold her car to move here, along with 57% of other families who live in the town. Not only does the relaxation of not driving make you less stressful, it also makes you get more excersize. Since 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, we can assume that they are one of the healthiest cities in Germany or even the world. If all cities in Europe were nearly identical to Vauban then they would have only 3% greenhouse gas emissions from cars, but they would also have a much lower rate of obesity. Even in some parts of the United States, car emissions would go down by 50% which would, in turn, cause obesity to go down by a gigantic number as well. The use of bicycles and your feet would greatly reduce obesity along with increasing happiness.

Although some people may argue that people who don't own personal cars will use public transit instead and societies without personal cars will not have a decreased obesity. This may be true, but if people use public transit then they are helping the environment even more than themselves. They would still have to walk to and from the bus stops. Which will decrease obesity although it may not be in as big of numbers as we would like.

In conclusion the absence of personal automobiles would greatly reduce the air pollution in most major cities. Beijing could become it's once beautiful city, and Paris wouldn't have to ban driving because of thickened smog. The United States would also never have problems with smog, and we would also reduce air pollution by 50%. Communities like Vauban and Bogota are prime examples of people who do not need cars to survive. They are stress free, and much happier than most car driven societies. Personal cars do much more harm, than good. This is why we do not need to rely on the use of personal cars.    ",0
"Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed. While some argue that this Facial Action Coding System is a step too far into an innovative future, the advanced program could benefit a multitude of areas.

Thomas Haung's new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life. Granting teacher's access to their student's feelings could give teacher's insight on how well their concept's are grasping. To further prove the computer's effectiveness, Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" (D'Alto). In addition to assisting a classroom setting, enabling people to read other's emotions would be benefitial also. Reading into surroundings helps people grow. Knowing what feelings an individual possesses could compell someone to be more considerate or act accordingly to how that individual feels. With that in mind, this program could also strengthen relationships.

Although the Facial Coding Acting System invades privacy, lessons human interaction, and may not be completely accurate of human emotions, it ultimately serves to benefit. While privacy concerns are understandable, the possible results after the slight invasion could be more than worth it. An unfortunate day could be quickly turned around if people were aware of the circumstances. Without a situation being addressed, nothing can be fixed;the same goes for a person's emotional state. However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression? Dr. Huang addresses this by introducing that the computer first constructs a 3-D model of the face, with all the muscles operating as a human's would. Dr. Huang also explains that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.

Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.",0
"After releasing the photographs about a mesa on Mars or now known as the ""Face of Mars"", theories have come up claiming that it is in fact a face of an old extraterrestial. This is completely false claim that has no evidence or support to be supported with. This mesa is a common natural landform that can be found commonly around. This is a mesa that happens to look like a face. Although it can look pretty convincing and decieving, it's something common. Like mountains on Earth, it's something that triggers your brain claiming it to be something it isn't. It's like seeing a shadow pass by the corner of your eye! You claim you saw it, but it was just a fragment of your imagination. It's something our brains trigger.

As it states in the article, praragraph two and three, it states that the face the public saw was just an illusion forming eyes, a mouth, and a nose. ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" This sentence supports the claim that the face was a simple fargemnt of the brain creating an illusion of something. It's a common landform that naturally is created. Although many theorist's claim that it had to do something with aliens and extraterrestrials, there is no evidence to support or back up that claim. Where else have you seen something out of the normal on Mars? Where there any prints or traces leading to something else? People just need to understand that it's was a landform and a landform only. In paragraph three, it supports the claim that the face was a natural landform. ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation. . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Not only did the face gain notorious fame, but the story got a lot of publicity and gained a lot more attention than it should have. All the face was was an illusion that the brain of many created. Although many knew it was a natural landform, many supporting those scientists wanted the outcome of the story to take a COMPLETELY different turn! Many wanted the face to be the result of an ancient civilization on Mars, which also couldn't be possible. There were a lot of crazy theories and rumors, but the truth was the one that people denied to believe in.

This story took many turns, twists, accusations, false claims, and more incredible stuff made up by the public. Although it was a simple landform, many denied that to the core, and many defended that statement with their live's. The simple truth of this whole mess, is that it was a photograph taken of a natural landform near Cydonia, that was mistaken as a face with eyes, nose, and mouth by the illusions of many theorists or confused and intruiged viewers. To think the public thought a landform would be a face.   ",0
"Some people think that aliens created the Face on Mars. Do you belive that to? I think that The Face on Mars is a natural landform here is why. "" The caption wrote huge rock formation"" which would most likely mean a natural landform from what N.A.S.A. stated when they unveiled the photo of the rock formation. Also has not found any evidence of life on Mars to this day.

N.A.S.A. had also said ""That if there were objects in this picture like airplanes, on the ground or Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" Also in the pictures that are in the article ther are no signs of any homes or camps or signs of life.

This also proves the theory that it is a landform ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West which would mean that this is somthing similar to what we have seen on earth before. The Jet Propulsion Lab said "" Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa.

Also if this was something created by aliens or an ancient civilization wouldn't it be deteroryating over time. From the rearch that NASA has done it seems that it has not changed at all over the past 25 years. So do you belive that aliens created The Face on Mars? I don't but mabye you do.",0
"Are students given enough freedom in school classrooms? Students attend school for approximately 180 days each school year. However, the work does not stop just because summer break begins. Teachers often assign specific projects to students at the end of each school year for them to complete by the time they go back to school in the fall. These projects can include reading a book, writing an essay, or completing worksheets. While some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more freedom, it is best for teachers to design these projects because they know what will benefit students the most and it is less inconvenient for teachers and students.

Teachers only assign students work that they know will benefit the students. Students may view summer projects as useless, extra work, but teachers always have reasons for assigning assignments. Many teachers' reasons for assigning summer projects is to prepare students for the following school-year. A vast majority of schools offer advanced placement courses which are very challenging and rigorous classes. In order to give students an introduction to what the class is like, teachers often assign summer projects. This helps the students in the long-run because they are given exposure to the course ahead of time.

Having student-designed projects is too much of a hassle for teachers and students. Adopting student-designed projects would require each individual student to brainstorm ideas for their summer project. Not only does it take even more time out of students' summer lives, but it also creates more work for teachers. If each student were to design their own project, teachers would have to grade each project using a different set of eyes. Each project would be unique, meaning teachers would not be able to use the same set of standards for all projects. Without having a standard list of requirement, students would not know if their project met the requirements and it would take teachers forever to grade the projects. Having one uniform assignment for all students would relieve much stress from teachers' and students' lives.

Some may argue that student-designed projects give students more freedom. Each student is creative in their own way and some may say that students are not given enough opportunities to utilize their creativity in school. Allowing students to design their summer projects would make it more enjoyable while also still learning. However, students do not always do things that are in their best interest. Instead, they take the easy-way-out.

Overall, it is in everyone's best interest to have teacher-designed summer projects. It creates less stress for teachers, and it prepares students for the next school year. Students are given freedom in the classroom in many other ways, and adding student-designed projects would make classrooms even less structured. Teacher-designed projects are beneficial to both teachers and students, and they should be used in all classrooms.",0
"When asking for advice people may want to ask more than one person.

They would want to do this so they can get more ideas on what to do, have more opinions, and can help in making the best choice.

Those are only a few of the reasons asking multiple people for advice is helpful.

To begin, when asking for advice it is good to ask multiple people to get more ideas on how to handle the situation.

When you ask more people they can tell you more ways on how to accomplish what you need to accomplish.

If someone has an idea to build a chair it is good for them to ask others for advice. They can comment on how it looks and feels.

Then they can use their feedback to improve the chair.

Secondly, opinions are really important in advice.

When someone asks for advice from other people others will give their opinions on what the person should do.

They will give an opinion on what they should do.

Opinions can be a good or bad but as long as someone picks the one they think is best for the situation everything will be ok.

Sometimes people may receive some opinions that are really bad.

It's ok to not have to listen to every opinion.

Finally, asking multiple people for help can lead to making the best choice.

If more than one person is asked on what to do they can come to the best conclusion possible.

Multiple people can help someone come to the best choice by combining ideas and opinions.

For example, the chair.

If someone asks for advice on it people will give ideas and opinions.

When they are combined they can create the best possible solution.

Asking multiple people for advice can be extremely helpful.

It can give a person more ideas, more opinions, and allow them to make the best choice.

Everyone can get advice, all they have to do is ask for it.      ",0
"I beileve the author supports this acticle very well humans could survive on Venus. It would take time and work but I beileve it could happen. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds.

These diffrences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. The Harsh tempatures and low air pressure the raidation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans.

NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted weeks in such condtions.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface. If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters.

In conclusion I believe humans could live on Venus unless It orbits too close to the sun it could get to hot. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dnagers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Would you want to live on Venus with the high tempatures and low air pressure? ",0
"Do you really thing a land form could make a face ? To me that seems something is very unlikely. A planet that we do not look alike can make a face as a organism on earth? Well i don't think so and here is why.

The photo isn't clearly shown as a face it just looks like a planets land form.

It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders. I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead. Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face. If you look closley you can see that the

""face"" has ridges or canyon. So maybe the ridegs/canyons made the land form that way.

NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac. According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years.

In conclusion the ""face'' to me is still just a land form. Just because it looks as if it is something could not just be made out of a human face. If they had more evidence then it would be believeable but until then my opnion is still that it is a land form.                   ",0
"A college study states that students are five times more productive when they work from home. This means that students would benefit from attending class from home. The reasons for this are, students are in a more relaxed environment and are less distracted by other peers.

When students have to leave home everyday and be around so many people it can get a little overwhelming. Meaning they are being put out of their comfort zones. This can cause them to show poor results in the classroom. One student said"" While they attended school they were a straight C student, but when they began homeschooling their grades significantly increased."" Later a parent stated that there kid had never been comfortable around large groups of people. This could have been avoided by removing that student from that stressful situation and allowing them to be home in a controlled environment.

It is a well known fact that students are distracted by their peers. This means students are missing important parts of class by talking with other students or watching other students do silly things in class. Taking these kids out of school, and leaving them at home to attend class makes them isolated from their peers giving them no distractions from others. This also allows their full attention to be on their work. This makes them more productive and able to take in more information.

When it comes to being comfortable or distracted at school these things all add up to one thing, limitations placed on students being able to learn at school. These things seem minor but they each play a role in students academic successes and can be avoided if you allow your student or child to learn from home. Being able to learn from home is a very beneficial idea that schools and teachers must take advantage of.",0
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. First, contracting advice from multiple people could provide you different points of view, to make the best choice. Second, not everyone will have the same advice and some may be better than others. Lastly, you could benefit more from hearing the advice of others more than one person. Talking to other people is smarter and more beneficial.

Contracting advice from multiple people could provide you with different points of view. Every person in this world has different advice to offer. Therefor, listen to everyone's advice because it will only help you when it comes to making a choice. For example, if you are making a decision about what collage to attend, but you dont know what collages to start looking at. The best thing would to do would to get others advice and how they feel about that choice. Other people can impact your choice to give a different stand point for your decision.

Not everyone will have the same advice. Therefor, some may be better than other peoples advice. Hearing other peoples advice varies from a range of helpful to not as helpful. However, any advice given is beneficial because you are gaining information and knowledge that will makeup your choice. Also, getting advice from others could help you put together your information and use it when its needed. Any advice helps, if you are put in a bad situation someones advice may help you with that.

You could benefit more from hearing the advice of others more than one person because, one person will not always give you the best advice. One persons advice will eventually end up being bad advice. Where as, advice from multiple people would help you get the best advice, that advice would be much more beneficial than one persons advice in many ways. For example, going to a church group and sharing advice is a spectacular way to get the best advice to make the right choices. In my opinion listening to other peoples advice is one of my main keys to success.

In conclusion, seeking opinions can help make a better choice. Reason being, getting advice from others could provide different points of view to make the best choice. Second, not everyone will have the same advice and each persons advice could help you in different ways. Lastly, you could benefit more from hearing the advice of others more than one person because, one person will not always give you the best advice. Making the best choice is a difficult thing to do but, having others opinions and advice is a great way to make the best choice.       ",0
"The modern automobile has been the axle to the wheel of the smog ridden contemporary age. Within a century, a car could be found within virtually every home across every developed nation. Though in recent years, the societal infatuation with private automobiles has begun to diminish. Mulitple European and South American countries began instituting beneficial ""car-free"" municipal policies and statistics show a decline in licencse registration and car purchases across the U.S. The progression of the ""car-free"" policies and trend will have beneficial ecological, economical, and social implications on the modern world.

The concern of greenhouse gas emissions from cars has been of much concern within the scientific world. With cities such as densely populated Bejing often covered in sheets of poisonous smog, the high emissions has proven deadly to both human and enviromental life. According to source 2, Paris recently was plagued by statuated amounts of smog rivaling that of Bejing. The French solution to this problem was municipal action and a week long ban on certain vehicles. The smog contained nearly 147 micrograms of particulate matter and the country's high use of disel as a gasoline alternative was a contributing factor. The policy was immediately effective as the smog lifted after only one day of the ban. Though the smog that plagued Paris is not only a problem of the French. As stated by Source 1, passenger cars alone are responsible for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions within car-intensive areas of the U.S. such as Chicago and Detriot.

The focus on automobiles with the development of car-intensive cities, such as the aforementioned Chicago and Detriot, has carried an economical burden in tandem with it's ecological consequences. According to Source 1, 80 percent of monetary appropriations have gone to highways with 20 percent going to other forms of public transit. As exmplified within the same article, Vauban, Germany has pioneered the car-free suburban model. Maximizing ergonomics to improve public foot transit, it has financially benefited from the prohibition of cars and the nuturing of its enviorment. Within the South American capital of Bogota, Columbia, who have been promoting an improvement campaign designed to encorage pedestrain-centric municipal development. As an effect of in newly revitalized walkways and parks, an industry of shops and restaurants appeared.

Within the United States the ""car-free"" movement has been gaining support. As stated by Source 4, President Obama demonstrated his vision to curb greenhouse gas emissions in a speech in 2013. This statement was aided by polls showing a demopraghic shift in licensed citizens.                ",0
"Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. Driverless cars are a phenomenal idea becauase they're innovative,all major car compaines are moving toward the driverless way and they're safe. This essay will disscuss these three reasons on why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea.

First driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. It states in the passage ""Originally,many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads"". This is putting into perspective that even futurists didn't believe it was possible but Google has achieved this monument to perfection. Also in the ariticle it says ""founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream"". As the original founder of this project he has even reached the level of innovation that he has been striving and working for since 2009.

Secondly alot of major car companies are striving for making their product driveless. For example in the passage it conveys ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time"". This is shownig how a major car company as innovative as Tesla is going to release a self driving car of their own. In that same paragraph it informs ""Mercendes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". Showing that even some of the luxury brands and the major car compaines are releasing a driverless car. Showing how they agreee with where the future is going and how much of a phenomenal idea it is.

Lastly, the driverless cars are safe and take limitless precatious to stay safe. It describes in the article ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearveiw mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"". This derscribes how many preperations is took for the car to be very safe.

In conclusion I have disscussed the three reasons why self-driving cars are a good idea. The reasons eing they're innovative, major car companies are doing it and they're safe. What do you think about the cars?   ",0
"Dear principal,

I have heard of the school cafeteria's plan to change to a new healthier school lunch. And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. I believe that keeping our school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.

My initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.

they are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. American's have this quote that "" if you have lemons make lemonades"" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.

In additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.

Again,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?

For instance, our school cafeteria's lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the school's improvement is your priority.

Thank you respectively,

"Some reasons the face is a natural land form is,there was a close up picture taken of it in 200,After the image was pixilized it was proven that there were no buildings around or in the face.

In 2001 there was a close up picture taken of the face. it confirmed there was no alien life, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform(7)."" In the picture the face isn't very defined like a statue would be, there are only shadows where land forms like rocks are making the illusion of a face.

A few people were not happy with the picture, saying that there could be alien markings on it, or a shack. So scientists got a pixilated picture of it, showing every detail of the face,"" It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Gavin.(12)"" So, it is in fact a natural land form. Before it was probably a rock, or hill. If a person back in that time had the technology to see it they would have seen something not yet weathered down. But now after centuries we see a face.

In conclusion the face is a natural land formmation. That is proven by picture and logic. It is not defined enough to be made by aliens.              ",0
"One major benefit of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. With fewer cars on the road, the levels of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide decrease significantly. This reduction in air pollution has a direct impact on human health, as studies have shown that long-term exposure to polluted air can lead to respiratory problems, heart disease, and even premature death.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas. As more people opt for alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, or walking, the roads become less crowded, resulting in faster and smoother traffic flow. This not only reduces travel times but also decreases fuel consumption and emissions caused by idling cars stuck in traffic.

Additionally, promoting car-free communities encourages a healthier and more active lifestyle. Instead of sitting behind the wheel for hours, people have the opportunity to engage in physical activity as they walk or bike to their destinations. This increase in physical activity can have numerous health benefits, including weight management, improved cardiovascular function, and reduced stress levels.

Moreover, limiting car usage can help create more livable and sustainable cities. As cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist-friendly infrastructure, such as bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and green spaces, the overall quality of life improves. People have more opportunities to interact with their surroundings, socialize, and enjoy their communities. This shift towards sustainable transportation also contributes to the reduction of noise pollution, making urban areas more peaceful and pleasant for residents.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage go far beyond just reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free communities, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, promote active lifestyles, and create more livable cities. It is essential that governments, communities, and individuals recognize the importance of prioritizing sustainable transportation solutions for a cleaner, healthier, and sustainable future.",1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I really believe policy number one is really the best because students know they cant use the phone during school so they decide to use it during class, lunch, or free periods. I think that if we tell the students ok you guys can use your phone only during lunch and free periods. if you tell them that they would be that's cool. but tell them as long as you guys have them off during class time. they will think well that's cool and have there phones turned off. but if you say no and say no cell phones allowed do you really think they will listen think about it if you do let them they will listen if you don't let them they will not listen to you at all i like the idea of policy one its great for us students. if you do agree with me please send me a letter back or just call me into your office thank you.

"Sure thing! Here's my essay on the benefits of accomplishing goals by always doing something:

Accomplishing goals is super important. Like, really important. But did you know that doing something every day can actually help you accomplish those goals? Yeah, it's true!

First of all, doing something every day helps you build habits. And habits are like, super powerful. Once you start doing something every day, it becomes a part of you. It's like, your brain starts to expect it and stuff. And that means you're way more likely to stick to your goals.

For example, let's say you want to learn how to play the guitar. If you just practice whenever you feel like it, you might not make much progress. But if you practice every day, even if it's just for a little bit, you'll be way better at it in no time. See what I mean?

Another thing that happens when you do something every day is that you get into a routine. And routines are like, super helpful for achieving your goals. When you're in a routine, you know exactly what you need to do every day to make progress towards your goals. It's like, your brain has a plan, you know?

And let's not forget about motivation. When you do something every day, you get motivated to keep going. Like, you start to feel like you can actually do it, you know? You start to feel like you're making progress, and that's super motivating.

Finally, doing something every day can help you stay focused. When you're focused on something, you're way more likely to achieve your goals. And when you're doing something every day, you're constantly reminding yourself of what you want to achieve. It's like, your brain is always on the same page, you know?

So there you have it! Doing something every day can help you accomplish your goals in so many ways. It's like, the ultimate way to get stuff done. So make sure you're doing something every day, even if it's just for a little bit. Your goals will thank you!",1
"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research the importance of perseverance when trying to achieve goals. And let me tell you, it's super important! Like, if you don't keep going even when things get tough, you'll never reach your goals. I mean, think about it, like if you want to get good at playing basketball, you can't just give up after a few tries, you gotta keep practicing and stuff.

So, I found some examples of people who persevered and it led to success. Like, Oprah Winfrey, she faced a lot of obstacles when she was growing up, but she didn't give up and now she's like one of the most successful women in the world. And LeBron James, he didn't become a pro basketball player right away, he had to work hard and keep trying, but now he's like a legend in the game.

But, on the other hand, if you don't have support from your family, it can lead to failure. Like, if your parents don't believe in you, it can be really hard to keep going. I know this because my little brother wants to be a pro gamer, but my parents are always telling him it's not a real job, so he gets discouraged and doesn't try as hard.

So, the difference between success and failure is like, success is when you reach your goals and failure is when you don't. And it's important to avoid making mistakes because they can hold you back from reaching your goals. But, it's also important to learn from your mistakes so you can do better next time. Like, if you fail a test, you can study harder next time and get a better grade.

And, I think it's important to have both successes and failures in life because it helps you grow as a person. Like, if you only have successes, you might get too cocky and not take risks, but if you only have failures, you might get too discouraged and give up. So, it's good to have a mix of both so you can learn from both.

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you found it interesting!",1
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Self-reliance is like, super important, you know? But, like, should we do everything ourselves or should we get help from experts and authorities? I think it's a tough call.

On one hand, making our own decisions about life's important matters can be really empowering. When we rely on ourselves, we feel more in control of our lives and we can make choices that are best for us. Like, if we want to start a business or pursue a certain career, we should be able to do it without needing someone else's permission. It's our life, after all!

But, on the other hand, sometimes it's hard to know what the right decision is, especially when it comes to really big stuff. Like, should we go to college or should we start a family? Those are huge decisions that can have a big impact on our lives, and it's hard to know what the right choice is without some guidance. And, let's be real, sometimes we just don't have the knowledge or experience to make the best decision. That's where experts and authorities come in. They can give us advice and help us make informed choices.

For example, like, my parents are always telling me to study hard and get good grades, but they're the ones who know what's best for me. They've been through college and they know what it takes to succeed. So, even though I might think I know what I want to do with my life, they can give me advice that's based on their own experiences. And, like, I trust them, you know? They're my parents and they want what's best for me.

But, at the same time, I think it's important to be independent and make our own decisions. Like, if I want to try out for the basketball team, I should be able to do it without my parents' permission. It's my decision and I should be able to make it on my own. And, like, if I mess up, I'll learn from my mistakes and become a better player.

So, I guess what I'm saying is that it",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that asking for guidance from experts is crucial when making decisions. While self-reliance is important, it can sometimes lead to poor decisions and missed opportunities. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits of asking for guidance from experts and compare it to relying on one's own instincts and ideas. I will also reflect on a personal experience of asking for guidance and discuss why it is okay to ask for help even when one values their self-reliance.

Firstly, asking for guidance from experts can lead to better decision-making. Experts have extensive knowledge and experience in their field, which can help individuals make informed decisions. For example, when choosing a college major, it can be helpful to speak with a guidance counselor who can provide information about different majors and career paths. They can also help students identify their strengths and weaknesses and suggest majors that align with their interests and skills.

On the other hand, relying on one's own instincts and ideas can sometimes lead to poor decision-making. For example, when choosing a restaurant to eat at, relying solely on one's own instincts may lead to a subpar dining experience. However, asking for recommendations from a friend or family member who has tried different restaurants can provide valuable information and help make a better decision.

In addition to better decision-making, asking for guidance can also provide a sense of security and support. When faced with a difficult decision, it can be comforting to know that there are experts available to provide guidance and support. This can be especially important for students who may be new to a particular subject or activity. For example, when learning to play a musical instrument, it can be helpful to work with a teacher who can provide guidance and support as the student learns and grows.

However, it is important to note that relying on one's own instincts and ideas can also have its benefits. Self-reliance can help individuals develop confidence and independence, which can be valuable in many aspects of life. Additionally, relying on one's own instincts and ideas can help individuals develop their own unique perspective and voice.

In conclusion, while self-reliance is important, it is also important to recognize the benefits of asking for guidance from experts. By seeking out guidance and support from experts, individuals can make better decisions and",1
"I strongly disagree with the idea that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities after school. I disagree with this idea for 3 simple reasons. The first one being that some students may simply just not gave the time to the extracurricular activities. For example a student may currently be in a situation where they have a sick relative and they're the caretaker of the sick relative, for personal reasons. Therefore they have no extra time on their hands for this activities. My second reason is that some students may not have any interest in any of the activities the school has to offer. Now some people might say for the students to create something that hey would enjoy. Although that may sound like a good idea, there are some key things that you have to think about like budgeting and things like that.

Even though the principle thinks he/she is helping the students they're really just wasting their time. My third and final reason is some students may have failing grades.

the reason why you should let students bring there phone to school because they would not have noting to do on there free time like when you are at gym in there is free play there is noting to but play different kinds of sports like basketball, volleyball , and jump rope when other people do not want to play any of the sports the only thing that they like to do is text there friends and get on the internet which make them feel more better doing that on there free time.

second of the reason you should let kids bring there phones to school they might have important phone call from there parents for example there parents might call if something went wrong in there family or if they had left there homework at home and last if they had forgot there backpack or other stuff like that.

third of all is because they need there phone if there is an problem going on in school or they would like for there parents to pick them up from school if another example is that they might want to there parents to drop off some food like also if your not feeling good they should tell the nurse that they want to call there grandmother or grandfather to go pick them up because they might have flu or a very bad cold.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I don't believe home schooling benefits because there is still a lot of distractions , it could cause laziness and irresponsibility.

Many people believe home schooling is a way better option then being at school because it creates more of a comfortable environment for the students. However, they don't think of all the things that are at home that could potentially be a big distractions for the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name tore his ACL and could not come to school for four months he was being home schooled and he said he would get very tempted to use his phone more then usual and was having a hard time focusing.

Another negative affect this could have on a student is laziness, he or she could get so used to having everything available at their hands they could have a harder time adjusting to everything else. For example , Generic_Name had broken her arm and had to get home schooled until she was better so she could come back to school. After she had healed her mind had gotten so adjusted to home schooling she got so lazy and it made it so much harder to come back to school.

Meanwhile, many people say it is the best thing to do. Getting home schooled could cause irresponsibility because it now changes the person to do things at their own time then having to be responsible and get things turned in at the right time and on time. For example, at a job you are required to check in at the time of the schedule handed to you not when you are ready and feel like it.

In conclusion, home schooling has more negative effects then positive and I encourage you to not use this form of easier education. Therefore, homeschooling can cause a lot of distractions , laziness and irresponsibility. All students should get the proper education that they need.                           ",0
"Should people who are driving be able to use cell phones while they drive? I strongly disagree, as there are new teens driving everyday. Teens tend to use their phones a lot and they probably haven't been driving as much as some adults. Regardless of how long you have been driving i personally think you should not be texting and driving, or doing anything with your phone. Teens are probably the people who cause most of the crashes due to them texting and driving or not focusing on the road.

Most teens take driving as if they were in a video game. I believe they use this thought process because in some video games you tend to do reckless driving and i think some teens take that idea. I personally think that ever since smart phones came out the car crash rates have gone up extremely. This is due to the egear of wanting to use your cellular device. I don't think we can stop texting and driving because most people do it and then act innocent when they see a police car near them. I know this from experience.

I disagree with this because people's lives are in danger with just a swipe or just writing a 3 letter text. You keep your eyes off the road which means anything can happen in the slightest second. I think there should be some type of app that you have to use in order to turn your car on, which then locks your phone until the car is off or you have reached your destination. Texting and driving is a serious cause and teens & adults should take this more seriously so they can risk not getting into an accident.      ",0
"The Electoral College has been a subject of debate for years, with proponents arguing that it preserves the voice of smaller states and ensures that candidates campaign in a more balanced manner across the country. However, I believe that it is time for a change. The Electoral College is undeniably unfair to voters, as it allows for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This goes against the fundamental principle of democracy, which is that the majority should determine the outcome of an election.

One of the most glaring examples of this unfairness is the 2000 presidential election, in which Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush. This outcome left many voters feeling disheartened and disillusioned with the electoral process. It is simply unjust that a candidate can become the leader of our nation without receiving the most votes from the people.

Moreover, the current electoral system results in candidates focusing their campaigns on so-called ""swing states,"" while largely ignoring states that are securely red or blue. This means that the concerns and preferences of voters in these non-battleground states are largely disregarded. Every voter, regardless of the state they reside in, should feel that their vote carries equal weight and has an impact on the outcome of the election. A direct popular vote system would ensure that every citizen's voice is heard and valued.

In addition to being unfair, the Electoral College is also outdated. It was established by our founding fathers in a time when communication and travel were far more limited than they are today. The intention was to provide a mechanism for electors to make informed decisions on behalf of the people. However, with the advancements in technology and the accessibility of information, this rationale no longer holds true. We now have the ability to directly vote for our preferred candidate, and it is time to embrace this progress in our electoral system.

Some may argue that we should maintain the Electoral College out of respect for tradition and the intentions of our founding fathers. While I understand the importance of preserving our democratic institutions, it is crucial to adapt and evolve as a society to ensure fairness and representation for all citizens. We have seen how the Electoral College can lead to outcomes that do not align with the will of the people, and it is our responsibility to rectify this flaw in our system.

Abolishing the Electoral College and transitioning to a popular vote system is the best way to ensure that every voter's voice is heard and respected. It would create a more fair and equitable election process, one that aligns with the principles of democracy and reflects the modern realities of our society. It is time to embrace progress and make this much-needed change for the sake of our democracy.",1
"I feel as though driverless cars are needed and could prove very useful to society. There are many concerns as to whether or not driverless cars are necessary or not. This essay is going to tell you how they can be safer than human drivers and can help solve some problems our world faces today.

Many people are concerned with the gas consumption of cars today. They fear that since so many people drive their own cars, they have to use up more gas, which is very hard to get more of. Driverless cars could be used in a taxi service sort of way, meaning more people could use one car since there wouldn't have to be a specific seating arrangement. If more people use one car, that's less gas consumed and more gas for the future.

People are also concerned with the overall safety of driverless cars. Some main pressing concerns are crashes and whether the car would be able to know how to avoid construction zones. While these are very important concerns, the creators of driverless cars are working to make sure those problems aren't a worry. As of right now, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. They still require a driver to avoid construction zones. However, with the way technology is advancing, it won't be long until they find out ways to help the cars avoid danger themselves without the help of drivers.

There are concerns regarding the safety and other features of driverless cars. However, these concerns can be easily solved with the advancement of technology. With technology evolving faster than we can believe, safe driverless cars won't just be a thought, they'll be a great impact on human society in the near future. Therefore, driverless cars should definitely be developed and everybody should be completely behind the development of them.",0
"Making music, drama, and art classes compulsory for students can offer many advantages. It is a great opportunity for students to learn to express themselves, explore their creativity, and develop the ability to think critically and artistically. Learning music, drama, and art can also help students better understand different cultures and viewpoints, and add to their overall educational experience. 

On the other hand, some students may not have an interest in these subjects, and making them compulsory may make them feel unmotivated and annoyed. Additionally, if these classes are not taught in an engaging manner, students may not be able to gain any meaningful knowledge from them. 

Overall, I believe that music, drama, and art classes should be included as part of the curriculum but not made compulsory. If students have a genuine interest in these subjects, they should be encouraged to pursue them further. This would help them get the most out of the classes and keep them engaged, while those who would prefer to avoid them should be allowed to do so.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This is evident in various parts of the world where efforts are being made to separate suburban life from auto use. By adopting a more smart planning approach and reducing reliance on cars, communities can experience benefits such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased access to public transportation.

One example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. Vauban's residents have given up their cars, and the streets are completely car-free except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs and a few streets on the edge of the community. This experiment has resulted in 70 percent of families not owning cars and 57 percent selling a car to move to Vauban. Residents report feeling happier and less tense without the burden of car ownership.

Reducing car usage is important for addressing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, communities can contribute to a significant reduction in emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to take action to increase public transportation options in suburbs.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, and it resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. Cold nights and warm days caused air pollution to trap car emissions, and diesel fuel was identified as a major contributor to the problem. By reducing car usage, cities can significantly improve air quality and create a healthier environment for residents.

Limiting car usage also promotes the development of more accessible communities. Bogota, Colombia, has been implementing car-free days for several years. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during these days. The turnout has been large, and people have embraced alternative transportation options. This has led to the construction of bicycle paths, parks, sports centers, and improved sidewalks in Bogota. Other cities around the world are also adopting similar initiatives to create more walkable and accessible neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. It can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased access to public transportation. Communities that have embraced car-free or car-reduced lifestyles have reported increased happiness and reduced stress. As efforts to limit car usage continue globally, more people are recognizing the benefits of smart planning and reduced reliance on cars.",1
"Dear state senator,

The electoral collage system has worked for many years however, citizens are starting to see through it. The system has lost control and citizens do not have control over their own country. It is unfair to voters, outdated, and the disaster factor is a perfect example going against it. Popular vote should be used in our modern society for a fair and clean vote, almost all citizens could agree on that.

The electoral collage voting system is an uncanny way for citizens to express how they want our countries future to go. They are voting for electors, not actual canidates. It isn't a straight forward vote- electors are the ones actually voting for canidates instead of the citizens. Since this is happening electors actually do not have to vote for who they're representing- Alas making the system very unfair and a cheat to people who live in our country. There is a winner-take-all system, which suggests that whoever is not elected is basically forgotten about amongst the people. They get nothing in return for all of their hard work, money, and time put into the election. Likewise, this system should not be used due to citizens being cheated out.

The electoral collage system of voting is outdated and old. The founding fathers created this system-making it a historical way to vote, but not the best way. Citizens through out the country are looking for popular vote, choosing it over electoral collage. The system may have work at an earlier date, but more and more people are coming into the world and they are looking for a bright future- knowing who theyre voting for is a start.

The 2000 disaster is a great example for us to switch to popular voting. As i said, electors technically do not have to vote for who they represent. So they went against the will of citizens. They made the choice to vote themselves. Basically, the electors control the entire vote and are the most important people in it-even though the citizens are supposed to control the vote. With that said, i'm sure you can see my concerns. Electors do not have to follow what the citizens are telling them.

The electoral collage voting system should be discarded and we should adopt popular vote. All citizens would agree on this choice. Including that electoral vote is unfair to citizens, outdated, and the disaster factor happened we should most definitely consider adopting a popular vote system and make our vots fair to citizens.

"Being able to take online classes from home, is something that i would like for all schools to offer. Graduating high school is a need in this time and generation, for the reason being that most jobs ask for at least if you graduated high school. There is lots kids in school and not all have the time to go to school, some kids have to help there parents work for there not financially stable. I myself have gone through that where had gone to an alternative school so i could have more time to work in the day and come home to do some of my courses. Many people say education is the number one thing you should worried about and thats right, though some kids can't cause they have to help there family to provide in relation to paying some bills, put food on the table or picking up there siblings. providing school to be done at home will help the kids that have to go through all of this.

high school can be hard at times work is stressful some kids hate to having to get up early is hard for them so they miss out in some of class time. You keep missing some of class every day it can turn into hour's of class time that you missed, also can effect in the way you are learning having more time in your day to work can help you for there you are learning at your own paste, not the teachers. Some students that learn slow. takes time for them to learn one thing and by then the teacher is on the next unit there learning about. everyone has there own way that they learn better students that are fast learners wish that they can learn everything faster to get the class over with to go on to the next. those students can get classes online so they could do them at home to get the most credits they want this would also help them graduate faster.

Very few kids know what they want to work as for there career. Doing online classes can help these students graduate earlier to go the school they want to go to, or there career they want to lean on. This can help these students out in many ways. Going into a career path the earliest you can is a great thing you can get more time to learn and get good at to what you want to be doing like working become a master tech the younger you are the more experience you could have when you get older. The more chances you can get to become the best master tech at your location. Many students in high school learn in there own way also are smart in there own way graduating early can help students to become what they want to be the most.                           ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing you this letter today to talk about the new policy of at least a B average to play sports. I do not favor this idea because most of our athletes in the school have only C averages. Our grading system for sports should stay as it is also because there really is no purpose of even having sports if you don't have good players. If you do decide to change this most of the parents and student-athletes would be upset.

Also what made you want to change the rule that you must have a B average instead of a C? Was there some sort of commotion about how people think this school doesn't have enough good grades or that were not smart enough? If so you need to tell them that just because our boys football and basketball team are undefeated does not mean we are not smart.

Our academic program here is already good as can be and i do not believe we can up how well we are anymore which would be pushing the limit. Thank you for reading this letter and taking time out of your day. I hope you will consider not changing the overall letter grade our student-athletes must have.

"In my oppion they should use the Electoral college to desied who wins the Election.

They should always use the Electoral college because it wouldn't be fair if they went by the population of a state, just the simple fact that some states are more populated than other. For instance states like New York, Florida, and California are more populated than, states like Hawaii, Rhold Island, and delaware.

The electoral colleged should always be the proses they use to elected a President of the the U.S., in my opinion the electoral colleged not only right but fare. Its equal rights and justice.

The Electore college states that you live in texas it right to voted for your own candidated.

Or in any state that you live in.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisism in the century; the system allows for us much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of people. Back in1960.    ",0
"Students Need to Identify a Career

I am in 11th grade and I still thinking in what career should be better for me, if I could expected a career by the time I entered to High School, I could not being worry about what career should be better for me. I think that is a good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because in the four years that they are in high school they can get prepare in the career they want. By the time the students enter to college it will be much easier for them because they have already decided what career should be better for them.

There are four year in high school, students can use those years to star to learn a little bit in the career they chose. For example, I had one friend that he wanted to be a scientist, so when he was in high school he get prepared to a scientist, he started to look what he need be a scientist, he looked how many years he had to go to college, he found that science has a lot of math problems that he did not know and he started to learn math. The four years in high school can help you to get prepare in your the career you want.

Another reason why students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school is that when go to college it will be much easier for them. If the students identify a career by that time, in college they can only focus in the career they chose. There are many students that go to college and they have not already decided what career should be better for them, and in many cases there are students that are out of college and still thinking what to do with their life. That's why it is important for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school or at least when they are still in high school.

In my opinion it's good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because if they could identify a career that they might think they would like, that could be a lot of helpful, because by the time they go to college they don't get stress because they don't have much time to decide what career could be better for them.",0
"I believe students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. Students should be able to use them during lunch periods and free times. I don't believe this is a bad thing. As long as cell phones are not being used during classes. I don't think it's bad because it's students free time. They're not in class so they won't be stopped from learning. Teachers and parents may say this is a bad thing because it might prevent students from learning. I don't believe this to be true because they're using cell phones in free times. Not as they're in classes or studying. The principal should allow students to bring cell phones and use them in free times. This should be the new cell phone policy.

Using cell phones during lunch periods isn't bad. Students will be using their cell phones during a free time given to them. It's not like they're learning something while eating. This won't prevent students learning ability. I t will actually make school more fun and a way to communicate with friends that may not be able to sit together. It could even maybe quite the lunch cafeterias. Students wouldn't have to yell across cafeterias anymore they could just text. Once lunch break is done students would need to put cell phones back or turn them off until another free time.

Sometimes students may be given free time. During this time students should be allowed to use their cell phones. It's their free time so I suggest students should be given the opportunity to use their cell phones. This way students will have something to keep them entertained while having free times. I don't think this is a bad idea because it's a time given to take a break rather than to work.

The use of cell phones during free times will not interrupt students from learning. It won't really matter because either way during free periods students aren't studying anything like in classes. Once students get back to normal classes then they should turn cell phones off to start learning once again. I believe that free periods should be given to let students take a break from studying, including the use of cell phones. I believe that the use of cell phones during free times won't harm students learning ability.

Teachers and parents may not agree on the use of cell phones during free times. Some may say that it will prevent students from learning. This to me is not true because students will be using cell phones during free times rather than learning times. If students are using cell phones during classes, then yes, the use of cell phones will prevent students from learning. Since students will be given the time to use cell phones during free times there will be no need to use cell phones in class. Causing no prevention of learning. I believe students should be given the right to use their cell phones during free times. This should be a new policy in schools.",0
"I think the principle is in the right because he/she is making us become more productive by having us do at least one activity.

I agree with the principle because i think humans should be more active than stay in their rooms all day. most people wont agree so the principle might need to start making incentives,lets go over some incentives.

First,you can make deals or start a point based system,for example the more activities you do the more points you get. All your points could be used for different items you might choose. I think more people will do more activities if they get a point based reward system.

Second,you can also give them school credit by every activity you do,but the credit should be in pieces,for example,if a kid does 3 activities then he gets 10 points for grade. Dont make it that all the students can is do activities and get an A,it should be like two activities = 10 points etc.

Finally,the school should have a student of the month type of thing,were whoever has the most activities done gets to be the student of the month while also having some benefits. There should int be any repeats so it can be fair and not just one kid can be the student of the month for 3 months straight.

In conclusion,school could be more active if they have a a lot of things to choose from,it could single handily save the schools reputation.",0
"School is a critical in developing your brain. It allows you to jump through hoops and solve problems for seven hours a day everyday. Seven hours a day seems a little long, right? Going to school in person for seven hours a day is too long, so students should go to school through online classes. Students would benefit from taking classes online because they can get a proper amount of sleep, finish their work in time, and have enough time to enjoy other activities.

Taking classes online is more beneficial for students because they can get a proper amount of sleep. Students who attend school in person are most often extremely tired because of the constant workload they have to endure everyday. Seven hours of English, History, Math, and Science for five days straight every week. Staying up late studying for each class is detrimental to your sleep schedule. By taking classes online you don't have to worry about this problem. During an interview a student who attends online classes stated ""Ever since I started online classes my sleep schedule has never been better. I at least eight hours of sleep every night."" If you stay up late studying you can sleep in to make up the lost time. By doing online classes students are able to achieve a proper amount of sleep every night to feel energetic and refreshed each day.

Taking classes online allows you to get your work done on your own time. In school there are at least 4 classes that everyone must attend (English, History, Math, and Science). All of these classes require essays and projects to be completed by relatively similar due dates, but time in your day to work on these assignments is limited. Generic_Name, an eleventh grade student, said during an interview ""The amount of school work assigned is too much to handle in one day sometimes because each class requires their own set of assignments, and there isnt enough time in one day to complete them all."" To compensate for the limited time, students either have to stay up extremely late or get up early to complete these assignments. Taking classes online would allow students to divide the time in their day more evenly to complete assignments that are given to them. This allows more focus on tasks, which will in return produce better results from the work they turn in.

Finally, by taking classes online students are allowed more free time throughout the day to enjoy extra curricular activities. By being able to complete work at your own pace, the extra time you can potentially gain can be used to other activities. Some activities that could be enjoyed are include sports, music, and art. In a recent interview with the head of administration he said ""Students who enjoy extracurricular activities are more adapt to learning and retaining knowledge."" These students retain knowledge easier because they have an outlet for any occurring stress during school. By doing these activities they can release any pent up frustration, so when they go back to the classroom their minds are clear and focused.

Getting a restful amount of sleep, finishing your work, and having enough time for extracurricular activities are just some of the many benefits of taking classes online. Online classes are overall more beneficial for students, as it allows them to grow in areas that time wouldn't normally allow. By having more time they can also hone skills that that will help society as a whole advance in years to come.",0
"Electoral college unfair, outdated, and irrational. There are quirks and many disputes on outcome of votes, it is perfered by 60 percent of voters that there should be a direct election but the the big thing is that it needs to be placed there.

Its stated that their are many reasons to retain the Electoral College despite those reasons, Electoral College is there for ceranity of outcome. some say that the electoral college votes are not counted and that there is no need for it, but direct vote can lead to a president who has no real will to the state.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors with only 270 votes requiered to elect there is no need to worry about a tie. With the Electorial College still up and running there are no reasons for voting to fall apart each state is entitled allotment of electors this equals to the members in the Congressional delegation there is one each for the House of Representatives plus two for your senator.

For example the Electoral College is there to make sure that there is always a vote due to the fact that only one half of the eligible voters in florida actually votede in 2012. The people placed in the Electoral college are people who want to express a politaical preference so that there isnt a probblem of a single vote deciding the electon and no ties for another realecting,so its better off.

Another great example is the Electoral College is the best way to go is that Each canidate in your state has its own group of electors and each state has a law that varys on how electors are selected with there own responsability leaving it fully cappable of its duties to properly elect a president by populer vote with the use of fully qualified citizens. So Electoral college irrational or rational qualified and equiped keeping the despised method un voted.         ",0
"All humans have emotional expressions. Emotional expressions can be detect by other humans that are in his/or her life. Any kind of technology cannot really tell what his/her expression is.

In the passage, the author is explaining how a professor has some sort of technology that can detect a male or females emotional expressions. Technology is not a good way to tell a person's expression, because technolgy can lie to a person's face, but it can always work.

"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a shadowy likeness of a face. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa.

MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his MOC captured a photo ten times sharper than the orginial photo. The image appeared on a JPL website which revealed it was just a natural landform. That meaning there was no alien monument. The pictre shows the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West. It reminds Garvin of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

It is a lava dome which takes place of an isolated mesa, the lava dome is about the same height of the Face on Mars

"Making choices can be hard. Whether you don't know what decision to choose from, or you're stuck on a couple of options, asking other people their opinions can be vital to making that decision. Seeking multiple opinions from others can help someone make a better choice because it lets them see from a new perspective, they can learn more about their choices, and asking for multiple opinions can help give you more ideas than just asking one person.

To start off, asking others for their opinion can help someone see from a new perspective. If you're writing a paper, or making a play, asking others for advice and opinions can help appeal to the larger public, and make you seem less bias. Looking from a new perspective can let you see how you sound to your audience.

If you're making something like a big business decision, simply asking others for their view can help you imagine how you would impact others. It can also shine some light on downsides you never noticed, so you can learn to avoid those kinds of decisions in the future.

Furthermore, listening to other people's opinions can help someone learn more about their decision. What I mean by this is, for example, if you wanted to try skydiving for once, you could ask people who have already done it what they think about it. It can help you look at the bigger picture. Asking other people with background experience can help inform you about your decision. Asking people for sources is important too. These sources can help, in a paper, make someone's writing more credible. If someone's making a hard decision, they can check the source and list pros and cons about a decision they aren't exactly sure about yet.

Finally, asking multiple people for their opinions can help spark more ideas. For example, if a family was going on a trip, taking in other people's ideas could help decide where to go, and it can make other people happy with the final decision. Taking a moment to listen to someone's ideas can also narrow down your options. If a college student is having trouble finding a subject they want to major in, they can ask people for ideas, which can inspire them to pursue something they are interested in. Asking other people for insights is better than asking one person. If you're ever feeling lost, asking others can help you whittle down to a few options.

Today's society is one where you can't get anywhere without talking to other people. Humans are social animals, and they can't live without other humans. Making hard decisions is all part of life, and getting through them helps shape who you are. Asking other people to help make a decision is a healthy choice. It can help you see the bigger picture, look at more options-- asking others can help you learn more about certain options, or see how they affect other people. Asking other people for insight is important and it can help make the right choice.",0
"Cities have come to the realization of how much pollution is being released into our air by motor vehicles. Many cities and countries are taking part in this attempt to clear the air, such as: Germany, Paris, Columbia, and the United States. Smog is hanging over many cities in a dull cloud, blocking the citizens lungs from receiving clean air but cities are starting to come to an understanding of how dirty our world is becoming.

In a small town with the population of 5,500, Vauban, Germany, the streets are completely ""carfree"", which does not include public transportation and certain roads meant for driving. If one wishes to own a car, they must purchase a car space with their home, costing a whopping 40,000.source:1paragraph:2 This automatically discourages homeowners to purchase a car because of the steep price. The attempt to rid the air of pollution is gradually becoming more and more successful. 70 percent of Vauban families do not own any motor vehicles, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to the small town. The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves of this movement and is promoting car reduced communities. Although this is occurs in the suburbs, it is hoped to spread into the cities as well. source:1paragraph:9 Paris came to the smart decision of a driving ban once their air was replaced with a filthy smog. All motorists that owned license plates with evennumbers were required to leave their cars at home for the day, or they would be fined. The same rule would apply to any motorists with oddnumbered plates the next day. Evidently, it did not seem as if the people cared about the wellness of their planet, since 4,000 drivers were fined in a single day. 27 people were so furious with this law, their reactions cause them all to have their cars impounded.source:2paragraph:1012 The pollution was catastrophic enough to have Paris challenging China for the record of the most polluted city in the world. After one day of a carless city, the smog cleared enough to revoke the ban for oddnumbered plates the next day.

In an attempt for worldwide change, Bogota, Columbia creates a ""Day Without Cars"" in the capital city holding 7 million inhabitants. Many citizens partook in this act. They hoped to promote alternative transportation such as buses, biking, skating, hiking and walking to reduce pollution and have fresh air to breathe. Any violators were to be fined a fee of 25. source:3paragraph:2021 This campaign began in the 1990s and has resulted in the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the highest amount of alternative transportation in any Latin American city, according to the city mayor. source:3paragraph:27 Bogota has seemed to make the highest impact of cleaning out air pollution, and resulted in a more positive effect on every person's life.

The motivation of people trying to clean up the human act of pollution and waste is abundant and consistent throughout the entire world. We are changing the daily enjoyment of our lives, animals lives, and the cleaness of the earth one step at a time. A study last year showed that driving by young adults decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, which is a huge accomplishment on our part, compared to the earth's well being in the past 15 years. source:4paragraph:41 If we remain focused on the wellness of our planet and ourselves, the world can be a better place.",0
"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit to go for even though there are dangers present.

While there are some dangerous features on Venus, the author's suggestion might be actually worth pursuiting.

There are many reasons to look forward to see Venus.

For example it was shown that scientist studied that there was some form of life on Venus.

Even though Venus is dangerous, it is still worthwhile to study.

Venus does have many physcial dangers that are present.

The text states, ""A thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atomsphere"" (Para 3).

There are also mild temperatures on Venus's surface itself.

Text goes on to state, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

Also, notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"" (Para 3).

This explains some dangers when pursuiting to see Venus.

But do not get caught up with the dangers of Venus.

There are still worthwhile things to look for when studying Venus.

The text states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit..."" (Para 4).

This explains the wonderful features that are worth it to see Venus.

There are as well other alternatives to exploring Venus if people do not want to be sent to Venus itself.

For example NASA has been working on other approaches to exploring Venus like making machines and computers.

The text states, ""... some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested ina chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (Para 7).

Text goes on to state, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. ...but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (Para 7).

This shows how these alternatives of exploring Venus can still be pursuited.

Although Venus is a dangerous planet to visit, there are scientist out there that would sitll go and explore Venus because of features that are worth studying for and give an idea of what it is like for Venus.

There are also maybe a possiblity of some form of life there.

Even if it is too dangerous to explore there are still many other ways to explore Venus.

There is much insight to be gained for this planet.      ",0
"Dear principal,

I think that student should be required to take part in community service because there are many benefits that can come from helping others. One of which can be learning a new skill or ability. One example could be if you are performing a service in an office like building you can learn the skills to be a good secretary. Also if you are performing an activity that requires a great amount of work such as delivering heavy packages you could improve your motor skills and become stronger an more fit. Another benefit that could come from community service could be improving your reputation around your community. If people that don't really know you see you helping others they may want to get to know you and might become friends with you. Performing community service can also make you a much better person. By this I mean that community service could teach you that there is much more you can do with your time after school than going onto Facebook, Aim, playing video games, and watching television. My last example is that community service could also improve the ability of a student to work together with others. If there are a group of people performing community service with each other the service could teach them to work as a team and to help each other out. In conclusion I think that community service should be mandatory in school.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0
"Many believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was actually created by aliens.

This landform gives off the illusion that it is a face.

To clear all confusion, the Face on Mars wasn't created by aliens.

As the cameras traveled around Mars what appeared to be a head from end to end stretching two miles was actually a Martian mesa.

Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia therefore NASA made the assumption that it was.

This Martian mesa was a bit different than the others.

This one had unusual shadows that gave off the look to be an Egyptian Pharaoh but was still considered a mesa.

Secondly, this landform was common around the American West.

This butte or ""mesa"" was just more oddly shaped than the others. This landform was created by a lava dome which caused it to look like a face somehow.

Garvin refrenced the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho which is another idea that it was just a landform.

On the contrary, this could be an alien made figure. The landform gave off an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

The passage also stated the landform stretched two miles from end to end which made the ""head"".

If the structure was bona fide that means it was well-rounded and nicely structured which means it took time to come together then it was done by what we call a second life.

NASA would rather hide that being afraid of conspiracy theorists.

To conclude, the ""Face"" on Mars isn't an actual face.

This structure is just a landform proven by NASA with statistical facts and photographs.     ",0
"I think the technology to read a student's emotional expression is not valuable. My reasoning for thinking it isn't is because it shouldn't be that serious to know one's emotions. The idea itself at first sounds cool if your trying to figure a painting's expression (like Mona Lisa) but, using it on a student to figure how the emotions they feel when they're doing something on the computer (math questions assigned by a teacher or a reading passage, etc.) is just unessassary and weird.

My evidence to support the claim of how this isn't really useful or nessassary is on paragraph 6 where it all explains how a computer should know when you sad or happy or confused/bored. It also explains how using the expressions the computer picks up it can determine whether the ad your seeing is boring you or confusing you and in my quiet honest opinion it is unessassary.

in conclusion, i think the technology to read a student's emotional expression is not valuable. ",0
"Having a positive attitude is an essential ingredient to success in life. A positive outlook on challenges can lead to more opportunities, improved friendships, and better health. For example, in the workplace a positive attitude can open up networking possibilities due to the impression of confidence it leaves on employers. In a social environment, friends may respond more positively when they encounter an attitude that embraces life rather than a negative outlook that may attract less desirable company. Finally, research has shown that both mental and physical health can improve with a positive attitude. People who think positively often recover from illness or stress faster.

It is important to think positively because of the benefits it can bring. A positive attitude can improve motivation which in turn leads to success. Thinking positively helps to reach goals and encourages problem solving which can lead to more creative solutions. Positive thinking also increases self-confidence and optimism, both of which are integral to success and self-belief.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is an essential component to achieving success in life. It can open up possibilities and increase motivation. While a positive attitude does not guarantee success, it can provide the mental and emotional strength to keep going when times are tough. Therefore, by maintaining a positive mindset, one can increase their chances of achieving success in different areas of life.",1
"In deciding on who will be in charge of our nation for four years, the people should be able to choose who they want and not be giving the decision to 538 people from the Electoral College when there are millions of people in the United States of America. The Electoral College should be removed because it is not fair to the people and the Electoral College is not organized. By changing the election to a win by popular vote, people can ensure its them deciding the future. Who knows how many times a candidate as president has won a state but it wont even count because the electoral College decides another.

An Electoral College is unfair to the people voting. Although changing it may be something shocking because of how long we have had it, like in passage 2 paragraph 14 it is ""outdated and irrational."" For example, as said in paragraph 11 of source 2, when the author states that some Electors haver voted for who THEY want instead of their party's candidate. This shows that the Electoral College can be fraud or fake. Who knows if we dont stop it now, what if the number of Electors that do that go up, our nation could depend on this. That's another thing. Our president affects how our nation is treated for 4 years and maybe even 8 if they are voted into office again. Why leave a big decision on a couple hundred people when there are millions waiting to get their right to choose.

A second reason to remove the Electoral College, is that it is not organized. If we remove them, we can avoid the messiness of elections where no candidates gets the majority votes as said in passage 3 paragraph 22. Another example is in source 2 paragraph 10, when stated that when people are voting for the presidents electors, many get confused and end up voting the wrong person. That can be big issue and is caused because of the organization of the Electoral College. This can be prevented by letting the popular vote of the people count instead of Electors.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is something that was successful in the past. If we start now we can slowly remove them, and head into a fair presidential election by letting the popular vote of the people decide who is president. Our president should be someone the majority of the people agree with, and not people who are willing to go with whoever they want instead of the majority of the state they represent.",0
"Today the majority of people use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of us just can't put them down, not even when it can cause other people to be unsafe. We use them from when we wake up to when we finally go to sleep. But is there a time that we shouldn't be on our cell phones? When we're driving it is never a good idea to be on your phone.

The reason that its a bad idea to be on your phone during driving is that it takes away your attention from the road. Driving is already a multitasking operation. We have to balance our speed, gas level, directions, music, air conditioning, and other drivers. The last thing we need is another thing to focus on, especially an entertainment device that we already struggle to put down. All cell phones do for drivers is add another thing to focus on, and the list of things for drivers to focus on is already too long.

Another reason not to allow phones in the hands of drivers is that, although distraction is a large issue, even if you argue that you can pay attention and multitask well enough, your reaction time is still slowed. It has been proven that multitasking lowers a person's ability to act efficiently. This also applies to driving. Not only do you run the risk of missing a turn or passing that restaurant that you were looking for, you run a very large risk of not reacting soon enough to a distracted driver, running off of the road, and rear ending a stopping car. Your slowed reaction time is a very large issue when using cell phones while driving.

The reasons for not using cell phones while driving are very compelling and should not be taken lightly. Many people lose their lives every year due to distracted driving. It is important to stay very focused and aware while driving. Do not risk your safety or someone else's due to cell phone usage while driving.   ",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that changing the school lunch system to include only healthy food is a bad idea. While it is important to promote healthy eating habits among students, it is equally important to consider the enjoyment of food and the potential perspectives on the issue. In this essay, I will argue that the benefits of the current school lunch system outweigh the potential drawbacks of a change to only healthy food.

Firstly, the current school lunch system allows students to choose from a variety of options, including both healthy and junk food. This variety is important because it caters to the diverse tastes and preferences of students. Some students may enjoy the taste of junk food, while others may prefer healthier options. By allowing students to choose from a variety of options, the school lunch system ensures that all students are able to find something they enjoy.

Secondly, the current school lunch system allows students to have a break from their studies and socialize with their peers. Lunchtime is an opportunity for students to catch up with friends, talk about their day, and relax. Changing the school lunch system to only healthy food could make lunchtime less enjoyable for students, as they may not be able to find the food they enjoy or may feel pressured to eat healthy even if they don't want to. This could lead to a decrease in student participation and engagement during lunchtime.

Finally, it is important to consider the potential financial impact of a change to the school lunch system. The cost of healthy food options may be higher than that of junk food, which could put a strain on the school's budget. This could lead to cuts in other areas, such as education or extracurricular activities, which could have a negative impact on students' overall well-being.

In conclusion, while it is important to promote healthy eating habits among students, the current school lunch system has its benefits. The variety of options, the opportunity for socialization, and the potential financial impact are all important factors to consider when making a decision about the school lunch system. Changing the system to only healthy food could have negative consequences for students' enjoyment of food and their overall well-being. Therefore, I strongly recommend that the school lunch system remain as it is, with a variety of options to cater to students' diverse tastes and preferences.",1
" Technology has revolutionized the way people live their lives, making it easier for them to find jobs, play video games, read books, and communicate with others.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME

2/2/11

I was regarding your ideas for allowing or banning cell phones at your school. The policy that I think would be best is allowing the students to bring their cell phones, but they MUST be turned off during class time. They may use their cell phones during only free periods, lunch, or before school (if the student is on campus), and as long as they are not a nuisance or used in any inappropriate manor.

This policy could make coming to school a more exciting thing for students, and could make them more motivated to learn. Technology is a big thing that students enjoy using, and they would be allowed to bring there enjoyment to school. Another good reason why this policy would work so well involves the student's parents/guardian. If a student has an accident with there clothes, then they could contact there parents, and ask them to bring them a pair of clean clothes, (with office approval of course).

Cell phones can also help new students that have cell phones, so that they can keep in touch with old friends, or relatives, and they will be able to have someone to talk to at their lunch. They won't just have to sit around by themselves, and they won't just have to sit their without talking to anyone. This policy is also a way for students to make new friends, and they are able to exchange numbers and to keep in touch, or to hang out with after school hours. Cell phones can also help students that enjoy doing there homework at free periods, and then they can check their work on the calculators provided in most cell phones.

In conclusion, the policy to allow cell phones at your school is the only right choice for you to make. It can help make new friends, make coming to school fun, and can help keep students in touch with their parents and friends at all times. This policy is can also help the new students who never really enjoy coming to a new school, but in some ways, they can still keep in touch with their old friends. I hope you consider my choice, and use this policy for your school to keep your students learning, while still having fun when they come to school.

"I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. It's really dangerous and a lot of people get injured or even killed from accidents caused by distracted driving. I know some people might say that it's important to be able to answer calls or texts while driving, but it's just not worth the risk.

First of all, using a cell phone while driving takes away from the driver's attention on the road. When you're driving, your eyes should be on the road and your hands should be on the wheel. But when you're on your phone, you're not paying attention to what's happening around you. You might not see that car stopping in front of you or that pedestrian crossing the street. It's just too dangerous.

Another thing is that using a cell phone while driving is a big distraction. When you're texting or scrolling through social media, you're not focused on driving. You might be looking at your phone instead of the road, and that's when accidents happen. It's like driving blindfolded.

Also, think about how fast you're going when you're driving. You could be going 60 miles per hour or even faster. That means that if you're distracted by your phone, you could be driving for a long time without even realizing it. You could be missing red lights, stop signs, and other important signs on the road.

Furthermore, a lot of states have laws against using cell phones while driving. They know how dangerous it is, and they don't want people to die or get hurt. If it's illegal, it must be bad.

I know some people might say that they need to be able to use their phone for work or emergencies. But there are ways around that. You could use a hands-free device or have a passenger answer the phone for you. Or you could just pull over to a safe place and then answer the phone. It's not that hard.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is too dangerous and should not be allowed. It's a major distraction and takes away from the driver's attention on the road. It's also illegal in a lot of places, and there are ways to avoid having to use your phone while driving. Drivers should just focus on driving and leave their phones alone.",1
"Have you ever been faced with a tough decision and not know what to do? What influenced your decision that you made the most? The answer to that question is most likely other peoplesÃÂ´ opinions. Asking them to share their experiences with the problem gave you knowledge to help you know what to do. You might not think much of them, but peoplesÃÂ´ opinions help us avoid mistakes.

Making a tough decision is much easier when there are people to tell you what mistakes they made. When you know about what they did wrong, it can help you avoid it. Say that you do not know which product to buy. Your friends all say that one product is better, because their product broke and is unusable after a short period of time. Making the decision about what to buy is no longer difficult, because you have the advice of people faced with the same decision, and when you heard about their mistake you avoided it. By asking your peers, you made a good decision.

Another reason to talk to multiple people when making a purchase is to learn from their successes. ÃÅf you saw a group of people successfully do what you are trying now, learn what they did to overcome the obstacle. If it worked for them, it will probably work for you. In the scenario above, would it make it even easier to decide if a friend said that when he bought the second product, it worked fine and he was happy with it? You would probably would have no more doubts about your once tough decision.

When asking opinions about what to do in your problem, asking multiple people can help confirm if information about your issue is true. When searching for answers, you will find false information. But if you ask multiple people, false information will be rooted out and replaced with genuine, helpful facts that will make your decision easier. Once, I was writing an editorial about the trustworthiness of online reviews, and discovered that most of them are fake. When I was finished with the editorial, my main message coming out of it was that a word of mouth recommendation is one of the most reliable sources of information. Asking multiple people about your issue will get rid of any doubts you had about your decision.

Now that you know about how multiple opinions are a valuable source of information. When asking your peers, you will find out about what mistakes were made by them, and how to avoid them. If you talk to people about how they succeeded in your position, you will know how do succeed, and you will. Asking multiple people for a word of mouth recommendation will get rid of all the fake information, and make sure you make the correct decision. Asking multiple people is the best way to avoid making the wrong decision.",0
"Life without cars may seem like a distant dream, but dreams are becoming a reality with new expiremental towns,  banning of driving in some cities, and a national day without cars. Cars are causing, in some cases, more and more pollution everywhere. Although we ignore the signs of pollution everyday, we must face the fact that we are polluting our planet, and something needs to be done about it.

Vauban, Germany. A little city that has a strange law, to live in this city, you must give up your car or pay $40,000 to park it. As a result, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here"" stated Source 1. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and a media trainer stated, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".  This new form of seperate suburban life from auto use is called ""Smart Planning"".  passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissionsin Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States.  With Smart Planning, we can cut back on greenhouse gasses and start to breathe cleaner, healthier air.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"".  Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it.  Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted.  Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars.  The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, 'the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four.  Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries.  Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies.  Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage.  New York started a new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing.  They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

Cars have done enough damage to this earth and its time we fix what we have caused. With all these new eco-friendly and car lacking ideas, we are so close to the isea where we can live without cars taking over our life.    ",0
"Do you ever have a yearning to have an experience where you help people, and see new places? I had one of those eye-opening trips myself when I took part in being a Seagoing Cowboy. All citizens should participate in this program. In this essay, I will explain why this program should include you in the next trip overseas.

When having deep affection for men and women who have served in wars such as World War Two, you long to give help back to them in repayment. That is why it feels so amazing to sail overseas with vital needs for discouraged people, such as animals or food. I have served for nine trips(the longest contributed by any Seagoing Cowboy), because it gives yourself satisfaction to keep youself busy with activities that lift people's spirits. If you join this program, you can feel like a warrior in different ways.

On these trips overseas, you can also live through rewarding and beautiful sites. With our free time in other countries, we had the opprotunities to see the Acropolis in Greece, and parts of China. We also got to experience what a gondola ride in Italy felt like through streets of water. Visualizing these historic places really make you want to see more of the world, and keep helping our world's health.

People opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place, but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much. Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home, the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments. There are many reasons why you can make up for risks and sacrifices on this trip to pass time or feel more connected to your service.

Becuase of the ways this trip is so benificial to participants, it is a great program to take part in. Seeing beautiful sites and repaying soldiers help you analyze so much more about other places and war. For many people, it concludes as an opprotunity of a lifetime, that will never be forgotten. For these reasons, all citizens should participate in the UNRRA program overseas.",0
"Dear Principal,

I do not agree with your idea of changing the school policy to have a B average to participate in sports. As you know right now the policy is a C average and i think that is a great grade average. I can see why you might want to change it, maybe its because kids would work harder and try to bring their grades up to a B, which would be a lot better and they would learn a lot more. But i don't think that that is a very great idea because, a lot of kids wouldn't make the team or they wouldn't get to play as much because their grades were not as high as they were suppose to be. I know some students that try really hard to get good grades but they just don't get school. So if this student was getting a C average and then he couldn't go out for sports then i think his self esteem would go down really low.

Also some kids might just be lazy and not even try out because they think it would be to much work to get a B average. If this was the case then your sports teams would start going down, your teams wouldn't be very good, and my guess would be that some students would just stop trying to get good grades because they don't see the reasons of why grades are important because he doesn't have anything to work to.

In our class there is around 30 students and about 23 of them do sports, and of that 23 my guess would be that around 10-15 of the students that do sports have a C average, so if you were to change it to a B average then these students would not be able to do sports or they would just have to start working a lot harder. I know from experience that it is hard and stressful to get an A and some of these students think that it is stressful and hard to get a C.

This is why i think you should leave the grade average the way it is.

"Students learn better if they are interested in what they are being taught. Teachers can't help struggling students if they don't know what students are interested in and the way they learn best. Therefore if students design their own summer projects they will be actively engaged in what is happening and understand what they are learning. Teachers the following year will then have a little bit of knowledge about what interests students, what will help them be more engaged, and how to help out students if they are struggling. With students being able to design their own summer projects it will benefit both students and teachers because students will be interested in what they are learning and teachers will know what students are interested in so they can help students in a way in which they can actually learn.

Student-designed projects will help increase grades and academic performance as well. With students being able to design their own summer projects, this allows teachers to help students utilize the way they study best by breaking down the way that their project was completed. This is important because once teachers are able to help students figure out the best way to study then their grades will go up and they will be doing good in school. But on the other hand if teachers were to design projects every summer students might not like the specific task he or she is assigned and it will cause them to lose interest in the project. If the student loses interest in their project it will also cause them to not do the project anymore and if it is graded then they will already have a bad grade for the quarter and that is already a bad start to the year. This will also cause a bad reputation for the student as a first impression and the student will not be able to get all the help he or she needs to be able to study well.

School is a main way for students to be able to express themselves through what they enjoy and the topics they favor. Students being able to design their own projects is a big way in which students can express themselves because by representing what they enjoy they can have a chance at being able to learn more about that specific topic in school that year. By doing a project on something that interests you it shows the teacher that you are interested in that topic and that could cause the teacher to want to teach it to the class and you will be able to understand and want to engage in class conversations on the topic because it's something that you would look forward to. This will also help by giving you the opportunity to show what you know and to be able to engage in a topic of your liking. By being able to design a project and fulfilling it, it will also show that you are doing it because you want to where if you were to do a project in which was designed by a teacher, they will not know whether you are completing it because you have to or if you want to.

Students being able to design their own projects will really be able to show whether they are committed to doing a project. It will show whether they are ready for the class and if they would be willing to spend a good amount of time specifically for the project. It will also show if they are ready for college and if they are prepared. Most importantly it will show what kind of student they are based on completion and effort. Being able to design your own summer project is a big responsibility and you need to be dedicated to finishing and working hard on your project not only because it is required but also to help you figure out the best way in which you can learn. Since teachers don't know what students are interested in it would be better for students to choose how they want to create their own projects. Overall if students were to create their own projects it would help identify in which way they learn best, what kind of a student they are, and what they are interested in.",0
"When people ask for advice,they sometimes ask more than one person. Seeking multiple outlookson a topic can be very helpful. I myself have found it very helpful and useful. Three reasonsi think it helps is, it gives you more than one perspective and ways to look at the subject, you can learn from others ideas and or mistakes, and after asking othes what their thoghts are, you can see which helps the best

I think the reason having more than one way to to look at somthing helps out because if your not sure the first person you asked is right or helpful, you have more than one option and or idea. The reason i say this is because when i was younger i asked one of my old freinds for for advice, and when i tried out his idea it only made things worse. So then i asked my friend Generic_Name for help, and i thought her opinions on the matter were smart, so i tried it out. Her ideas ended up fixing all my problems. That thoght got me thinking, a person can also learn from other's bad advice or mistakes

Learning from others thoghts and past decisions really effect the decisions we make, and help us make sure we're making the right choices. I think this is true us because when i was learning how to cook chicken nuggets, my brother told me what he did wrong when he first made chicken nuggets. So when i made them i made sure not to do what he did. What he told me really helped me out, because i was planning on waiting to hear a ding noise from the oven to know when the nuggets were done. Turns out thats what he did wrong.

After hearing other's comments,thoghts, and ideas it helps to think about everyone's advice and decide what helps best for the situation. I have come to a conclusion that thinking about which person's advice works the best is a major help. I remember a year ago after asking four of my closest friends about a sitation i got into that i can't go into details about. They all had good ideas, but it was hard to decide right away. So i had to really sit down and think about the best option. After a while i had to go with my gut and go with my friend Generic_Name's idea. And it worked out better then i thought it would.

People seem to ask for more than one person's opion, when they need advice. People say having more than one point of view on simething can be very useful. I am one of those people. Having more than one perspective and ways to look at situation, being able to learn from others ideas and or mistakes, and after asking others what their thoghts are, you can see which helps best are just three reasons i think asking multiple people for advice helps greatly.",0
"Dear Principle,

I think that students shouldn't be forced to do community service unless the won't to. They should not be forced to do they community service if they did not something wrong. Just let them have of choice whether they want to do it or not. Take a serve to see if student students wants to do they community service.

They should not have to be forced because its not required. Sometimes when we get forced to do something we don't do a great job. Most of us if you ask for our help to do something we would do it. Just see it from a student's view and not just see it from yours.

Just if you want us to help keep our community safe and clean just ask.

If you gave us a choice and we thought that we should do it and we vote to do it then, we would not have a problem with doing community service. Some of us think its not our job to help the community, but it is. We live in the community so we should be responsible for it. Some of us think that if we didn't do anything bad to the community then we shouldn't help at all. I think that we should do it but, give us a choice first before you do anything.

Take a serve to see how many students would volunteer. If you have enough students helping then don't make us all help. If all of us students are willing to help then that's a good thing. Just tell us in the serve what we would have to do and tally up the scores and see who would all like to do it. The serve would be a good way to see who like to do something and who wouldn't like to do it.

At the end of the day it's your choice whether you won't us students to do it or not. Just know forcing someone to help isn't the best way to ask student's to help. Giving a serve would be a better way to see if your student's want to help the community. If you gave us a choice to do it or not its most likely not every one would help. Just",0
"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about the pros and cons of graduating high school in three years instead of four. Some people say that it's a great idea, while others think it's a bad one. In my opinion, I think it could be both good and bad.

One pro of graduating in three years is that students could get their high school diploma earlier and start college or their careers sooner. This could be really helpful for students who know exactly what they want to do and want to get a head start. For example, if a student wants to be a doctor, they could start medical school right after high school and save a year of college. That's a lot of money and time saved!

Another pro is that students could take more challenging classes in high school. Some schools have a three-year graduation program where students can take more advanced classes like AP or honors classes. This could be really good for students who are really smart and want to challenge themselves. They could learn more and get a head start on college.

But there are also some cons to graduating in three years. One con is that students might not get enough sleep. High school is already a really long day, and if students are taking more classes, they might not have enough time to sleep. Sleep is really important for your brain and body, so if you don't get enough, you might not do as well in school.

Another con is that students might not have as fulfilling an education. If students are taking more classes, they might not have as much time to explore their interests and hobbies. They might also miss out on important extracurricular activities like sports, clubs, and volunteer work. These things are really important for your social and personal development, and they can help you find your passion in life.

Finally, there might be less financial aid or scholarships available for students who graduate in three years. Some colleges and universities offer more financial aid to students who take the traditional four-year route. This could be a problem for students who don't have a lot of money for college.

In my opinion, I think the three-year graduation program could be a good option for some students, but not for others. It really depends on the individual student and their",1
"Did you know the 75% of high school students do their summer assignments in the last week of the summer. Some even do it in the first week of school. This percent would decrease if the students projects were self chosen. It would help them by giving them the choice of doing what they want to do. They would be able to be more creative, be able to do it faster so they can enjoy their summer and some families money is a struggle and they can't afford the teacher directed projects so they can do what works for them.

When a project is student directed they have the freedom to do what they want and be creative with it and actually enjoy doing the project. I have had hundreds of projects in my eleven years of schooling and some of my favorite ones were in my cooking class last year. My favorite one in that class was a food truck project. My teacher said you have to make a cardboard box food truck, make a menu, and make one item on the menu. Otherwise we were free to do what we wanted. I ended up making some really good food because she said just do what you want. I also ended up getting a good grade because I could be creative on that project.

One major problem with summer assignments is that students either forget about them and don't do them or they push them off until the last minute. I am one of those students that procrastinates until the last minute to do my AP summer assignments. It makes it very challenging to do them when there is only one week in summer left and I want to have fun and enjoy the last parts of the summer. I have friends that are worse than me and either don't do the AP work at all or they do them at the beginning of the school year, but if they were self chosen they would not have the issue of not wanting to do them because they can do what ever they want and make it what they feel is good.

My final reason is more on the extreme side but I have seen it happen. It is where the teachers summer work is a large project that is simple but costly and some families that I have seen do not have enough money to do the project. They normally end up failing the project because they never did the work, but if they could do what they want for it they could've passed. Where if they were short on money and it was limiting them on what they could do if they needed to they could do a less expensive project and save their money for other things.

There are many other reasons that students should be able to do their own thing for their projects over the summer but here are just a few of the reasons that people say that they should remain teacher directed. It's that it is a lot easier for the teacher to grade based on what they are looking for because they can grade on their scale of how close it is to what they want. But when it is student choice they can be creative and have fun, the project can go faster and they can enjoy their summer for what is it and it can be more cost effective for the families that have lower incomes.",0
"Many of us are used to getting somewher by simply using a car, but should we always use a car. If we limit car usage we can solve most of our problems. We can save ecomically and collect less polution

In source one the German Suburbs are car free, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbiden generally. Car ownership is allowed, however where a car-owner buys space for their car has to pay near $40,000, along with a home. As a result according to source one 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars , and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Many citizens complain when the gas prices go up, but if we limit our car ussage we wont have to complain anymore. We will save money, because when we decrease the usage of cars we wont use as much gas or deisel. Heidrun Walter told Elisabeth Rosenthal that he now lives happier this way. Not only do we save money but we also relieve tension through out our bodies.

However we may not enjoy this new idea of limiting car usage some of us actually enjoy driving but, there are days where after a long day of working the last thing you want to be in is in traffic jams.""It's a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman named, Carlos Arturo Plaza who rides a two seat bicycle with his wife.

In other ways that limiting car usage could help us is by eliminating pollution, of course everyone enjoys breathing in fresh air. By limiting car usage we can help lower polution. According to source two,"" After days ofe near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" the usage of car produced so much smog that they had to ban driving. Many of use drive to so many places that are near by that in reality we dont really have to use our car not only will we reduce pollution, but we will also maintain ourselves fit by using different alternatives like, walking, running, ridding our bikes. Although some may say, "" what if its an emergency,"" its fine we're only limitting car usage, we aren't goining to ban it forever.

If we limit car usage we can not only save money, but we can also reduce polution, and have a better lifestyle. Although these aren't the only ways limiting car usage can benefit us.    ",0
"Be a master in any area is something really awesome, because you already have experience and you already know what are you doing. There is positive and negative things for being a master.

In my opinion

I disagree with Emerson becasue even if you are a master in an specific area you never stop growing, everyday you learn more about your mistakes and about life and how to live a good one, also you learn something new that helps you in all types of areas that you have in your life.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way.

If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life. That is why you need to choose carefully what do you want, because maybe in the future you can regret and that is a bad thing that you can erase,becasue you feel frustrate because you spend a lot of time on something that you didn't like.

Being an expert in an area is something really important, the positive things for being a master is that:

You domain your area and nobody needs to command you.

You can do the things easily and quickly.

You are an expert in what are you doing, so you are exited.

Is more easier to get good things, something that benefits you.

You can get great jobs with a good payment.

You can be also your own boss or manager.

There is also negative things for being a master:

There are many people that they are an expert in any area

You need to compet with your rival

You need to try to be the best

If you have a business and you are making some mistakes you need to fix it quickly because it can affect to your own skills.

In conclusion

I disagree with Emerson, becasue you can still growing even if you are making a lot of mistakes, you can still achieve new things,you need to grow in person and in skills,always.

You can stay in the position that you are right now but you can always grow and be better everyday.",0

"The world of automotive technology is constanly changing for what engineers believe is the best for society. There are always new and improved ideas for cars, but some of them may not be in the best interest for people. The idea of a car that drives itself seems both unreliable and unrealistic. After reading this passage the idea of a self-driving car seems like more of a hassle than the number one item on a person's Christmas list.

The ""driverless"" cars of today are far from not needing drivers. Most cars, like the Toyota Prius, have many sensors within the car. Though these sensors do help alert the driver if the car is out of control, they do not fix the siuation or get themselves out of it. I have been in a Toyota Prius on a dangerous, icey road, and the car did alert the driver when we were out of control, but the car did not correct the situation it rather made a loud beeping noise and had a flashing signal on the dash. These cars are not driving themselves, but instead relying on the drivers to pay attention to their warnings.

Self-driving cars are also a problem when it comes to legal situations. Dr. Werner Huber believes that entertainment while driving is a great idea for drivers who still need to pay attention to the road. So what happens when a driver is distracted and does not adhere to their self-driving car's warnings? Well the same probelm that occurs with drivers every day. There will still be wrecks and deaths. These cars are not making the roads a safer place, but instead making legal situations more confusing by not knowing who is at fault for an accident.

Though these cars have no large, positive effect on society engineers still continue to work every day on them. These cars are not changing what the base of a car is, but are getting plenty of attention for it. Self-driven cars are unachievable, and they do not benefit society in a positive way.",0
"Dear State Senator,

In voting for a new president we should keep the process of the Electoral College.  The Electoral College is apart of the United States' history.  It was established by our founding fathers in the Constitution.  If we keep the Electoral College there will be a less chance of a tie and a dispute then there would be in a popular vote process.  Also the Electoral College is fair and we would be avoiding run-off elections.

The first reason we should keep the Electoral College is there will be a certainty of outcome.  Even though the total number of votes is 538, the chance of a tie is likely ,but highly unlikely.  ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney....Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state,"" this means that a tie is not likely, but it could happen (Posner 18).  If we used the process of popular vote in the United States there would be a bigger chance of a dispute over the outcome then there would the outcome of an Electoral College.

The next reason we should keep our historical process of the Electoral College is it's fair.  According to an excerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" from

Slate Magazine , ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal"" (Posner 19).  This means that all states are equal and none of them have more or less power than one another and none of the states have enough power to elect a president.  Bradford Plumer from

Mother Jones thinks ""It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,""  there are many arguments that state that the electoral college is unright, many people disagree saying its a great system involving easy and fair processes.

Also the Electoral College reduces the pressure which complicates the presidential election process.  With the Electoral College the problem of elections where none of the candidates have the majority of the votes cast is avoided.  ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College"" (Posner 22).

Keeping the Electoral College is very important.  First off it is a part of our nation's history.  It also keeps electing a president easy, fair, and non-pressuring.  Even though the method of the Electoral College is outdated and old, it still is a good way of electing a new president.  This process keeps disputes from occuring and makes all the states be heard and equal.                                ",0
"Dear state senator,

Changing the vote from voting for a slate of electors to popular vote would be reasonable. I think that having to vote for a slate of electors is pretty hard knowing that you're basically just voting for people that's with one president or another president. Popular vote is a good idea because you can get a bit more accuracy from the votes.

Electorial college has 34 electors who ""Can be anyone not holding office"" also voters can get confused about who they're voting for. ""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electorial vote."" If there was a tie, it would have to be ""thrown to the House Of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" We really dont want the House Of Representatives solving a tie for us. Unlike the popular vote where there is re-counts, the electorial college has none of that. If its a tie it gets passed on to another group.

Popular votes are more ideal because you actually have a chance of the person you voted for actually becoming president. If there's a tie, re-counts are established. Popular votes also don't have ""disaster factors"". This also has a less chance of a dispute erupting like it did in 2000 with the electorial vote. With popular vote, you are guaranteed that you know who you're voting for and you don't have the possible chance that you've just voted for the guy you highly dislike. Popular votes had also won the election for President Barack Obama. Where if it were electorial college, it would have taken a long time for the winner of the vote is announced.    ",0
"Dear senater i feel like we should overrule the elector college. I feel like this because it seem like the people vote dont count. The winner take all vote is super unfair. I think that who ever gets the most popular vote shoulkd be president because thats who the people want to president. Whats the point of having the people vote for president when they vote dont even count, its just the waste of their time.

The electoral college is made up of 538 and the majority vote is 270 that means that who gets the majority wins the election no matter what the popular vote saids. which is the winner takes all vote. You never know who on the electoral college they can be racist and dont vote for a black or  mexican president. the eletoral college is is outed system of picking a president, and its time to pick a new system.

"Experts are coming up with a new technology ""Facial Action Coding System"" that is supposed to read students facial expressions. Prof. Thomas Huang , of Beckman Institute and Prof. Nicu Sebe are working together to develope more ways for humans and computers to communicate.

Each expression is then compared aganist a face that shows no emotion.

"I think that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. Here are some reasons why I believe this:

Firstly, social media is a powerful tool that can influence people's opinions and beliefs. For example, if a popular celebrity or influencer shares their views on a particular topic, it can sway the opinions of their followers. This can lead to a shift in societal norms and values, as more and more people adopt these new ideas.

Secondly, social media can also create pressure on individuals to conform to certain standards. For instance, platforms like Instagram are filled with images of perfect bodies, luxurious lifestyles, and exotic travel destinations. This can create unrealistic expectations for people and make them feel like they need to live up to these standards in order to fit in or be accepted.

Lastly, social media can also be a platform for promoting positive change and raising awareness about important issues. For example, the #MeToo movement gained momentum on social media, which helped to expose the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in various industries. This led to a shift in societal norms around what is considered acceptable behavior in the workplace.

In conclusion, I believe that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it can be a force for good, it can also create pressure to conform and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. It is important for individuals to be aware of these influences and use social media responsibly.",1
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement is driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life in urban areas. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage, including the German suburb of Vauban, the city of Paris, and the capital city of Colombia, Bogota.

The German suburb of Vauban serves as an example of the benefits of limiting car usage. In this suburb, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, and car ownership is allowed but limited. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move there. One resident of Vauban expressed her happiness with this lifestyle change, stating that she is much happier without a car and that having a car always made her feel tense. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to increased happiness and reduced stress for individuals.

Similarly, the city of Paris implemented a partial driving ban in response to severe smog pollution. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city. This shows that limiting car usage can have a tangible impact on reducing pollution and improving air quality. It is worth noting that exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers, indicating that alternative forms of transportation are encouraged.

In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. The event was a success, with millions of Colombians choosing to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work. This led to the streets of Bogota being devoid of traffic jams for a day. The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, attended the event and praised the efforts of the people of Bogota in generating a revolutionary change. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can inspire other cities and countries to adopt similar measures and make a positive impact on transportation and the environment.

These examples highlight the advantages of limiting car usage. By reducing the number of cars on the road, greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States. Limiting car usage also improves air quality and reduces congestion in urban areas, leading to a better quality of life for residents. Additionally, promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, contributes to a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and reducing congestion. Examples from around the world, such as the German suburb Vauban, the city of Paris, and the capital city of Bogota, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage. By adopting similar measures and promoting alternative forms of transportation, cities and communities can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Dear Ms. principal

My name is STUDENT_NAME and

I am with you on changing the school policy. I feel that it is fair that a student must obtain a B average to play in sports or other activities. Most things in sports whether your trying to make a career out of playing sports, comes down to what your grade is. Playing a sport or attending activities is more like a privilege that you have to work for to get. Changing the school policy is actually a real good idea because most students really want to play sports or attend activities and changing the policy to having a B average will get students to succeed in changing their grade to attend these things and even more successful in class. Most students don't want to be lazy and most students feel a passion for the sport or activity that they do or attend , so if playing a sport or attending activities means that they have to try hard, perceiver to try and bump up their grade even higher then that's what the students will do. Thank you for your time

Sincerely,

"Some benefits the students have it in many ways

I think , in my opinion to take class in online thats not good ways for learned. Because it is so dificult for they understand what the teacher is talk about it is there when they became confused and dont have it any benefits for them . This so new for them this is making that the students take time to assimilate what the teacher say it and learining . There is when the teacher become teach it they dont know what they doing because they don't have the cofidence we they teachers because you feel weird to talk we someone you dont know . Sometimes it is more better take normal class at schools for some students it is easy ways to learned because have time after school for making anything they nedd to make .

First reason, Some student are confused when they take this class in online for any reason it is so dificult . Also dont have any benefits for them this it is because some students become confuse to understannd what it is class about because they dont pet attencion because the class turned boring to taking the class in this forms . Some student have some troubles with the language, because they dont know english this making they become confused, and some of them fell the class because dont talking they can not expressing they self to talk .

Another it is because the student , at home attendent be more lazy's and have more trouble to concetrated. Because they have more distraction , At home this why I think have class in online have consecuencies because they dont learning any they have distracion eg, som distracion are phone, taking, and tv .

Second reason , some student's can not assimilated what teacher's say it because have problem with the internet in dont is clear what they talking . Sometimes the student's does like the class in online and more hurt to learn. Eg, Some students are not prepared for tecnology,

I mean with this they dont not how use it hte computer or making any work . Eg when the students come to school dont understand the teacher ask to them inmedialy they explain and you undderstand . But this class at computer are so diferent t to get what the teachers are teach during class.

Third reason ,some times it is more good take class at schools . Because Take class at school have good benefits you learnig many things if any diffult for you to understand . Because anything you dont understand you can asked you teachers, anytime you want and have better grades at class .

Some students can stayed after school make the work you dont make it , finished work that you not done during class, and retake test .

sometimes it is good have it class at school becuase you know more people in have someone that you talk this so help for some peoples for when they are stressfull .

I think to come at schools have it more benefits, that have it class in at online. Because schools are first important place where can you learned dont have any trouble for making the work turn more easy for us . Also class online for me it is secundary , because you need to have more knowleges in many forms one ways it is ;

taking, speaking and know how to use it the computer fast. In this class some times the student dont put attencion they dont get any thing, if becuase difficult this making some students fell in class in online.

Students have many oportunities because the teacher's take the time to help the students after school in this good for students because they finished the work fast and know more about it.     ",0

"Making good decisions is essential for personal growth. When faced with choices, it is important to actively research the consequences of making the wrong decision before rushing into any conclusions. It is also crucial to consider how our decisions might affect the people around us. Seeking guidance from an expert can be beneficial in order to gain insight and perspective on the various potential outcomes of our decisions. Additionally, it is of the utmost importance to take time to appreciate life because we never know what the future might hold. By understanding our decisions and their potential consequences, we can make more meaningful and wise choices that impact both ourselves and our loved ones in a positive way.",1
"The benefits of a four-day work week with ten-hour days for both students and teachers are numerous. Firstly, students need more time to relax and prepare for their future. With a four-day work week, students can have more time to focus on their studies and prepare for exams, which can lead to better academic performance. Additionally, students can use this extra time to pursue hobbies and interests that they may not have time for during a traditional five-day work week.

Secondly, teachers also need more free time in their lives. Teaching can be a very demanding profession, and teachers often have to spend a lot of time outside of school helping students with homework and tutoring. With a four-day work week, teachers can have more time to spend with their families, pursue hobbies and interests, and take care of their own mental health. This can lead to a happier and more fulfilled teaching experience.

Furthermore, a four-day work week with ten-hour days can also have positive effects on the economy. With fewer work days, employees can have more time to spend money on goods and services, which can boost the economy. Additionally, a four-day work week can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction, which can lead to lower turnover rates and higher employee morale.

However, it is important to note that a four-day work week with ten-hour days may not be suitable for all industries or companies. Some industries may require employees to work longer hours or be available for emergency situations, and companies may not be able to afford to pay their employees for a four-day work week. It is important for policymakers and employers to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of a four-day work week before implementing it.

In conclusion, a four-day work week with ten-hour days has numerous benefits for both students and teachers. It can lead to improved academic performance, increased job satisfaction, and a happier and more fulfilled teaching experience. While it may not be suitable for all industries or companies, it is worth considering as a potential solution to the challenges faced by modern workers.",1
"BOOM!! You're on I-75 on the ground bleeding out watching everyone surrounding you, calling 911.

At this point you're thinking to yourself, ""why the freak did this happen?"" A couple hours later you found out an adult was on his phone texting and driving before the wreck happened, which is the most selfish thing to do while driving. Putting your life and other's lives in danger just so you can send a stupid text to your girl/boyfriend is completely selfish. I firmly believe that we need stricter phone laws to in jail people.

Texting while driving is in the top five causes for deaths, and yet many states do not have laws against it. We need to stand together united and encourage our Congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distraction.

and be mature and adult-like and discuss ways to not further endanger each other.

Cellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it, but I know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change. What's more important to you: a notification or somebody's life? Our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make the roads safer for everyone, we as people need to come together an decide what to do to make things happen, we don't know how much more accidents have to happen in order to push it into effect.

We dedicate our selves to our phones,we cant go 10 minuets without trying to see if we got a notification, the time we spend on our phones is tremendous its up to 6 hours a day! Not including the time spent in your bed! If there were something to happen to all of our phone we would go insane,if we would just make stricker laws for phone an driving the people would stop because of the consequences.      ",0

"The reduction or limited usage of cars impacts the daily lifes of society and also benefits the enviroment; It could also Change the way you see things.

Limiting the usage of cars can reduce the pollution in the air caused by cars and  motorists.

Around the world people have a different way of thinking when it comes to cars, Society has come to realize that car usage is becoming dangerous & unnecessary. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day; to promote alternative transportion and reduce smog"". In colombia People have decided to change the routine of driving everywhere in cars because it might be unnecessary since their destinations might be close; instead they reduced the transportation usage and only buses are permitted; it lowers the pollution in the air. This demostrates that a campaign of limiting the car usage should begin in other countries.

In Germany People have founded other ways to limit the car usage instead of banning cars. Society decided to make the streets more compact less far away from the community itself. ""Make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with, less space for parking, stores are placed a walk away on a main street""  By doing this action; it takes pressure away for people who use their cars everyday to drive anywhere. It also saves people money by not spending on gas & most importantly it encourages people to walk and  exercise by doing simple things like shopping. It also psychologicaly impacts community members. "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".

There's many others ways of influencing people to not use cars. For example, making a national fine. Like the goverment in France made "" License plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine"".

Driving less could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, It will allow people to feel more free and less stressed and it also allow them to meet new friends, their could health become better ; The economy could rise, traffic will be cut. There would also be less car accidents and crashes due to less traffic.    ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have been hearing from teachers and students that you are considering to make the new rule about cell phones at the school.

I'm writing this letter today to tell you that it would be the best rule to let students have cell phones out during lunch.

Many people are probably writing you a letter but if you are reading this you wont be disappointed.

First, cell phones can be used during classes and be helpful for the learning environment. A lot of students could use their cell phones for different things but students could use their cell phones as a calculator if they don't have their own. Also, students could use a cell phone to time something like in Science when you are doing a lab and need to time something.

And, if the teacher asked you what time it is in New York you could be the first to know because you would have your cell phone in use with times all over the world.

Second, many of people who don't have any thing to do after they finish their work could use their cell phone to keep them selves occupied and quite.

After a student is done with their work they could start to get loud and be annoying to the other class mates but if cell phones were allowed then the student could just play around on their cell phone quietly.

And, lots of students can concentrate better if they could listen to music while they work.

And, I my self think that it is a lot easier to think when I can hear music that I like.

Third, there is a few students that might say they would not want cell phones to be allowed in school because they can be very distracting in lots of ways. If cell phones were allowed at school they would not be ringing during class because students would turn their cell phones off or put them on silent or vibrate mode.

And if you would allow cell phones I as a student writing to you will promise that i would never take my cell phone out during class unless i had the permission to and maybe to see what time it is the faster way.

Many students and teachers have been talking about allowing cell phones to be taken out during lunch.

It was a great opportunity for me to write this letter to you explaining why I think it would be a great thing for cell phones to be allowed at school.

Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to read this letter that I wrote just for you.

Sincerely,

"Dear Principal,

What you see is what you get.

With teenagers nowadays, we have all of this new technology we take advantage of.

We always have our faces plastered to our cell phones and computers, and we sometimes forget to stop and appreciate the simple and beautiful things in life.

As a teenager who just recently was able to text, I feel in love with it.

In fact, I was obsessed with it.

Always spending my free time looking at the screen of my phone instead of spending time where it counts.

Hours after hours of countless messages going in and coming out of my phone.

Before you know it, I've wasted all of my messages for the month and haven't started my homework for the night.

And it seems like there is no time left.

I feel as if you should not allow students to have cell phones with them at all.

Cell phones are also a trap for cyber-bullying.

How many stories have you heard on the news about how a girl and her best friend made up a rumor about a not as popular girl, and in the end, the girl takes her life.

Do you really want that to happen right under your nose, and the school could possibly have charges put on them in legal fees for something a student did while on school grounds.

We've all heard the stories, but none of us are worried it could happen to someone in any place.

I feel that if you allow students to have their phones with them for times such as free period or lunch, no work will get done.

It is supposed to be study hall, not ""text OTHER_NAME what your wearing tomorrow"" time.

Cell phones suck you in like a black hole.

Trust me, I learned the hard way.

All I know is that its hard to pull away from something that enables you to talk to your ""BFF"" all the time with a quick message.

I also think that if you do pass the rule, allowing students to have cell phones with them for certain periods but not for academics, is not such a good plan.

We're teenagers, we do whatever we can to get what we want.

If you allow us to have cell phones on us for lunch, we don't want to put our phones away.

Some of us are just too lazy but others will say, ""We were allowed to have them with us a couple minutes ago."" or ""I'm not finished with my conversation with OTHER_NAME.""

Its hard to stop, and school should not be the place to start.

If you allow teens to have cell phones in school, it is a recipe for disaster.

Things will start to go awry and school will not be the way school was intended to be.

Not a social network for friends, but a safe environment where children can get a quality education.

I don't think texting lies and hurtful things to someone else is safe.

Do you?

Cell phones are something teenagers always have.

School doesn't need to be a place where students don't pay attention.

We are here to learn, and that is what I intend to dYou must not allow any students to have cell phones in school at all.",0
"Dear principle,

I think that students should be do community serves, but not too much only. probably only like one hour or tow. Because sum individuals might have things too take care of. For example some might need to take care of a sick relative or a little sister or little brother because there parents cud be at work or a meting and stuff like that.

Or maybe that a few students were out sick and out of school for a rely long time and do not have time to do community serves because there caching up on there school work. Maybe we can even make going too tutorials a community serves. I did that when i went to court when i was out for so may days.

We can even start a ""cleaning the school club."" Were students clean around the school and get community serves time. Or helping a teacher during, before like set up tables and other things like that, and after school by cleaning the class room or if its a science teacher you can help clean up after a lab has been completed.

"Online education has grown rapidly over the past decade, providing convenient and flexible opportunities for students to learn. By taking into account the diverse needs of students, educators can take advantage of online education to make up for missed school days due to personal, health, or sports considerations. Additionally, remote learning can ensure that students are not disadvantaged by weather-related cancellations, minimizing disruptions to schooling. 

In-person and online classrooms offer their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Time management is an important factor to consider; in online classrooms, students are often responsible for establishing their own study time, whereas an instructor can structure a traditional classroom to ensure that learning time is used efficiently. Furthermore, online learning can be less distracting, as students have more control over their environment. That said, online education can be lonely and isolating, as students miss out on conversations and collaborations with their peers. As such, it is important to weigh all potential factors before deciding between an online or in-person learning environment.

All in all, online education can meet a variety of needs, often allowing students to learn in a more flexible manner that suits their individual needs. With careful consideration of time management, distractions, and potential isolation, remote learning can be advantageous for students with missed school days or weather-related interruptions.",1
"Many people believe that self-esteem comes from achievement.

They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement.

True self-esteem comes from achievement because accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder, help you praise yourself, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

Accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder.

This is important because achievements comes from all your goals you have accomplished and that helps you want to try harder and to achieve many other goals you might have that you want to achieve.

This helps you build self-esteem by making you feel good for what you have accomplished.

Also since it makes you feel good it helps you want to accomplish other things because it makes your self-confidence grow stronger.

Also achievement helps you praise yourself.

What this means is praising yourself inspires you to continue to do many other things.

Praising yourself keeps you wanting to keep on achieving your goals.

It is like an inspiration because you know that after any achievement you are going to praise yourself and that is going to make you feel good.

So praising yourself makes you have a higher self-esteem by helping you feel good within yourself.

Moreover, achievement is a long lasting satisfaction.

For example, you have jsut achieved a goal you've had for three years now it makes you feel very satisfied that you finally made it.

Eventhough some may think satisfaction on something you achieve is not important you should because satisfaction with yourself makes your self-esteem go up.

satisfaction is a result of an achievement and a achievement helps you be more confident with yourself.

Achievement is the key to higher self-steem because it pushes you to try harder, helps you praise yourself a little more, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

If you want to have higher self-steem then achievement is the key.",0

"Why do we have Vice Presient,Presidednt,ect..? Its because of our founding fathers. They decided that it would be easier if we had people controling the world that we live in.

Each candidate running for Presidentin each state has his or her own group of electors. You can choose your state's electors when you vote for a candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.

After the Presidential election,your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. This certificate also declares the winning presidental candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent yuor state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your states Certificates of ascertainments are sent to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of the presedential election.

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the presient .Voters sometimes get really confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. Voters cannot always control who they are voting for but that is ok. the state decides who to pick the elctors thats in first place. Its ok to make mistakes sometimeas.

"Dear Principal

Sometimes when children get kick out of school they do Community Service. I think all school's should make they children do Community Service. It's something to keep them busy and keep them out of trouble. Community Service is one of they punishments we have.

Well to start it off. Community Service is a important thing to do. It keep your culture looking wonderful. Most of the times you can do community service just by helping someone with they yard work. Its a activity for most people. My brother love doing community service , he love people , and the people love him. Community Service help a lot of minors that need something to do , and i think that will help most of them do right. Most of the time you see men doing Community Service by picking up trash or helping someone with a house. I think Community Service will keep some of them out of trouble. Its a policy for some people to do community Service if they get kick out of school, because the judge probably told them they had to do Community Service.

Community Service is like helping someone stay out of trouble. Keep you busy at all times and doing the right things. It Keep you from doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Community Service is like a job, but you not getting paid out of it. Most of time some people can do community service by doing the right thing or they can do something with they life by doing community service.

"Hey there! As an 8th grader, I think it's super important to give back to our community and make a positive impact on the world around us. Here are some activities I came up with that can help our community, ranked from easiest to hardest:

1. Picking up trash in a local park or beach - This is probably the easiest thing we can do to help our community. It only takes a few minutes to grab some trash bags and pick up any litter we see while taking a walk or having a picnic. Not only will this make our community look nicer, but it will also help keep our environment clean and healthy.
2. Volunteering at a local animal shelter - If you love animals, this could be a great option! Animal shelters always need extra hands to help take care of the animals and clean their living spaces. You could help walk dogs, play with cats, or even help socialize scared or skittish animals.
3. Organizing a food drive for a local food bank - Food banks help provide food for families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. You could organize a food drive at your school or in your neighborhood and collect non-perishable items like canned goods, pasta, and rice.
4. Planting trees in a local park or green space - Trees are super important for our environment because they help clean the air we breathe and provide shade for people and animals. You could work with a local park ranger or conservation group to find a spot to plant some trees and help them grow!
5. Creating a mural or public art project - If you're artistic, you could create a mural or public art project in a local park or other public space. This could be a fun way to add some color and beauty to your community, and it could also help bring people together and promote creativity.

I think the easiest activity to start with is picking up trash in a local park or beach. It's something that can be done on my own or with a group of friends, and it only takes a few minutes. Plus, it's something that can make a big difference in the long run! After doing some research, I found out that if we pick up just one piece of trash every day, we can make a",1
"As an 8th grader, I believe that having career guides in high school is incredibly important. Research has shown that students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to pursue their dream careers. Without career guides, students may struggle to understand their options and may end up in a career that they are not passionate about.

One of the main benefits of having career guides in high school is that they help students understand their options. Career guides provide information on different careers, including job duties, salary ranges, and educational requirements. This information can help students make informed decisions about their future and can help them identify potential career paths that they may not have considered before. Additionally, career guides can help students understand the skills and qualifications needed for different careers, which can help them prepare for their future.

Students without access to career guides may struggle to understand their options and may feel lost when it comes to choosing a career. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in school, as students may feel like they are not being prepared for their future. On the other hand, students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to be motivated to learn.

To give students the opportunity to pursue the careers they want, schools can provide access to career guides, career counseling, and work-based learning experiences. This can include internships, job shadowing, and other hands-on learning experiences that allow students to gain real-world experience in their chosen career. By providing these opportunities, schools can help students gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen career.

Career guides can also help students feel excited to come to school by providing them with information on potential career paths that they may not have considered before. By exposing students to different careers, career guides can help them find something that they are passionate about and that they want to pursue. This can lead to a more engaged and motivated student body, which can have a positive impact on the entire school.

There are also examples of people who have limited access to career guides. For example, students from low-income families may not have access to the same resources as their peers",1
"I think art edukation is super impotent for kids. Some peoples might say its not that impotent but I disagree. Arts helps kids with theyre imagination and creativity. Like for example when we do art projects in skool it helps me think outside the box and come up with new ideas. Also it helps with theyre self esteem and confidence. When we perform in frunt of the skool or in a play it helps us not be affraid to speak in frunt of peoples. Also art is a way to express our selfs and show how we feel. Like when Im feeling sad or mad I can draw a picshure that shows how I feel and it helps me feel beter.

Another thing that sucks is that some skools are cutting art programs cuz they think its not that impotent. This is super wrong cuz art is a way for kids to express theyre selfs and it helps them develop theyre brain. It also helps them be more creative and have better imagination. Without art edukation kids will be bornt and not have as much fun in skool.

I also think that art edukation should be a requirement in skool. Just like math and english, art is impotent too. It helps us with our problem solving skills and it helps us be more critical thinkers. Also it helps us understand other subjects better like history and culture. Like when we learn about diffrent cultures throught art it helps us understand theyre way of life and theyre belifs.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally do not think that community service should be required by all students. Yes, community service is beneficial to the community, but students need to focus on one thing, and one thing only. School. I believe that community service can be an extracurricular activity outside of school, if anything.

You see, I know how it's like to be a student, as do you, and I think we can both agree on how hectic situations can get throughout the year. Homework becomes burdensome at times, schoolwork becomes tedious. Your life is bifurcated between school and outside of school, leaving almost no room for anything else.

If you were to make community service mandatory at school, how do you think that will unravel? For all you know, petitions could be made by my fellow classmates. I'm sure some of my peers agree with my point of view regarding this topic.

I genuinely hope for the best of this school, my intentions are not to be harmful. I want to set straight that I am not just an ignorant, lax, student who is too lazy to participate in community service. I assure you I am not. I take part in community service almost every week, as a matter of fact.

"If you think the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you're out of your mind. Aliens didn't create the Face, it's just a huge rock formation. In fact, the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.

The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Garvin says it's about the same height as the Face on Mars, which shows that the Face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte.

When the picture of the Face was posted on a JPL web site, it revealed a natural landform. Many people believed there was no alien monument after all.

So in conclusion, there are many reasons why the Face is a natural landform. The theory of the Face being created by aliens is inaccurate. ",0
" When people seek advice, they are often unsure of the path to take or the decision to make.

When individuals make poor decisions, they can have a significant impact on their lives and those around them. This can be devastating, such as losing a spouse or harming their children. It can also lead to negative influences on their children and set them on a path towards a bleak future. This is why many people end up in jail and don't emerge for an extended period. The absence of a parent can be heartbreaking and leave individuals feeling depressed.

On the other hand, making the right decision can lead to positive outcomes. It can help individuals avoid legal trouble and set a good example for their children. This can lead to a better future for their family and provide a sense of security and stability. Seeking advice from the right person can be a valuable resource and can help individuals make informed decisions that benefit themselves and their loved ones.

It's important to remember that the choices we make can have a significant impact on our lives and the lives of those around us. It's crucial to consider the consequences of our actions and make decisions that align with our values and goals.

"Dear Mr. Principle

I think, in my case, that children should not have to community service if they don't want to. it's my opinion that if children don't want to do something they shouldn't have to. isn't that what our country is built on.

freedom to do what ever you like. we are the country of love, peace, and happiness. ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" we will always have these options. and if community service doesn't make you happy, then i guess we don't have our rights.

What if the teachers give you a lot of work one night and you don't have time to do community service. or your little brother, who just loves and adores you, has a little league base ball game and you miss it to go to do community service, and during that game he hits a home run and when he gets to first base he looks back for his big brother to cheer him on and guess who isn't there. So the little brother stops turns and cry's away. you've just made a little boy cry by making his brother do something he doesn't like to do.

If peoples hobbies are to do community services then I am fine with that. Good job for them. They are probable smartest people in the school and learning comes easy to them then that's good for them. People like me, we have to work to get what we want, we just cant think of something randomly and make us famous.

"Cell phones play a huge part in today's society. They are used in our daily lives by letting us gain access to the internet, communicate around the world, and much more. They are life savers for many, but can it also cause tragedy? In many scenarios, these devices can put one in danger, especially while driving. Some may think otherwise but in capacity, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle.

See cell phones, in most cases, are distractions from reality. Many aren't focused nor are they aware of their surroundings. Being in that state of distraction can cause minor slip ups such as simple as tripping over a rock. Now imagine one being behind the wheel with this distraction. In this scenario, a person is in control of a fast-moving vehicle. Being distracted while operating a machinery that can put you and others at risk is nowhere near safe nor okay. People increase their chances in crashing even for just looking at a notification for a second. If someone is in a situation of being distracted because of their cell phone, there's a high risk of drifting off the road, hitting another car, or even an innocent pedestrian. It also puts their own life in danger as well as the fellow passengers.

Being distracted with a cellphone while operating a vehicle is comparable as being under the influence.

While being under the influence of any sort or alcohol or drug, people tend to not be aware that they are in a position where they can injure or even worse put innocent people in danger as well as themselves.

Distracted driving and drunk driving both have similarities but they also differ in one major thing, the decision. The person that has the choice of checking their phone also has the choice to not. They decide to either put their life in danger or make the smart, right decision to focus on the road. That small action of not checking your phone, whether or not you know it, saves you and as well as other pedestrians lives. The choice is up to them.

Many people think of it as futile information when being told that using a phone on the road can lead to fatal deaths or major accidents. These warnings should not be taken as a joke. Even if you confidently ponder that you can multi-task and that you'll be fine or it won't happen to you, the possibilities are endless. About 9 people die everyday due to having or being a distracted driver. Over 1,000 injuries are due to this.

Today, there are families grieving over loved ones that were lost due to these incidents. It just takes the person behind the wheel to realize that lives are put into their hands. So leave the phone alone and remember, better left unread than dead.         ",0
"Failure is a concept that has been debated for centuries. Some people believe that failure is a necessary part of life and can be used as a stepping stone to success. Others argue that failure is a negative experience that should be avoided at all costs. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and explain my position on the concept of failure.

On one hand, proponents of the idea that failure can be used to become a successful person argue that it teaches valuable lessons. When we fail, we are forced to reflect on our actions and identify areas where we need to improve. This process can help us develop a growth mindset, which is essential for success. Additionally, failure can help us build resilience and perseverance. When we face challenges and overcome them, we become stronger and more capable of achieving our goals.

On the other hand, opponents of the idea that failure can be used to become a successful person argue that it can be demotivating and discouraging. When we fail, we may feel like giving up or becoming discouraged. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a decrease in productivity. Additionally, failure can be a waste of time and resources. If we spend too much time and energy trying to overcome a failure, we may miss out on other opportunities.

In my personal experience, I have found that failure can be both a positive and negative experience. When I have failed, I have learned valuable lessons and developed a growth mindset. However, I have also felt demotivated and discouraged by failure. In order to use failure as a stepping stone to success, it is important to maintain a positive attitude and focus on the lessons that can be learned from the experience.

In conclusion, the concept of failure is complex and multifaceted. While some people believe that failure can be used to become a successful person, others argue that it is a negative experience that should be avoided. In my opinion, failure can be both a positive and negative experience, and it is important to maintain a positive attitude and focus on the lessons that can be learned from the experience in order to use it as a stepping stone to success.",1
"The legalization of marijuana has been a topic of debate for quite some time now. While some argue that it should be legalized, others believe it should remain illegal. In my opinion, I believe that marijuana should be legalized.

Firstly, it is important to note that marijuana has several medical benefits. It can be used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, and even cancer. By legalizing marijuana, patients who suffer from these conditions would have access to a safer and more effective treatment option. Additionally, legalizing marijuana would also reduce the number of people who are imprisoned for possession of the drug. This would not only save taxpayers money, but it would also help to reduce the number of people who are unfairly punished for using a drug that is safer than alcohol.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would also help to reduce drug-related crime. Currently, the illegal drug trade is a major source of revenue for criminal organizations. By legalizing marijuana, the government would be able to regulate and tax the sale of the drug, taking away a significant source of income for these organizations. Additionally, law enforcement resources could be directed towards more serious crimes, such as violent crime, rather than being wasted on drug-related offenses.

Another argument in favor of legalizing marijuana is that it is a safer drug than many other substances that are currently legal. For example, alcohol is a legal drug that is responsible for thousands of deaths each year. In contrast, there has never been a recorded death due to marijuana use alone. Additionally, tobacco use is also legal and is responsible for numerous deaths each year. By legalizing marijuana, people would have a safer alternative to these drugs.

However, there are also arguments against the legalization of marijuana. One of the main concerns is that it would increase drug use and abuse. While it is true that legalizing marijuana may lead to an increase in use, it is also important to note that drug use is a public health issue rather than a criminal issue. By legalizing marijuana, the government would be able to provide education and treatment programs to help individuals who struggle with drug addiction.

In conclusion, the legalization of marijuana is a topic that has both pros and cons. However, in my opinion, the benefits of legalizing marijuana outweigh the drawbacks. By legalizing marijuana, patients would have access to a safer and more effective treatment option, drug-related crime would be reduced, and people would have a safer alternative to other drugs. While there are concerns about increased drug use and abuse, these can be addressed through education and treatment programs. Ultimately, the legalization of marijuana would be a positive step towards a safer and healthier society.",1
"Cars are great, you can get from one point to another in a short amount of time, but are they really necessary? After all we have public transportation, bicycles, and our own two feet.

The advantages of car usage can be picked up by other forms of transportation, and the environment can be saved at the same time. If car usage was limited the world and its people would be much better off. There would be less pollution, a drop in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes, less accidents, and over all a healthier planet and world population.

There would be less pollution because if car usage was limited then there would be less pollutants from the gas in cars going up into the air. Source 2 provides evidence of this, from ""...days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Duffer 10 to ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Additionally many people are content with not having a vehicle, or even a licence in some cases, as shown in Source 1, 3, and 4. In Source 1 Heidrun Walter explains her view on not having a car after previously owning one, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source 3, shows his support unlimited car usage by saying how it helps the environment and the health of the people in reducing stress, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Source 4 Elisabeth Rosenthal speaks of how her own children and Mr. Sivak's son, all avoid using cars and Rosenthal's children don't even have licenses and they are 19 and 21 years old.

The health of the people in our world would improve and there would be less people diagnosed with diabetes because they would likely get more exercise. With limited car usage people would have to find other ways of transportation, which includes bike riding, skating, hiking, or public transportation. While using public transportation would not help to improve the health of the people, biking, skating, and hiking would, as some people do these things just for exercise. So if people were forced to do one of these alternative forms of transportation, they would be exercising and getting from point A to point B all in one shot.

Not only would limited car usage help peoples health by making them be more active, but it would also help by providing cleaner air. Poluted air can cause health problems, especially in the lungs, if car usage was limited, then polution would go down, so people would be breathing fresher air that would cause less lung damage.

There would be less accidents because there would be less cars on the road. The majority of the vehicles on the road would likely be public transportation too, so the drivers may be more cautious than the average driver since they have the lives of many people in their hands.

The world would be a safer and healthier place is car usage was limited.",0
"Social media has become a big part of our lives. We share a lot of personal information on social media, like our location, contact information and personal pictures. But is it safe to share all this information? I think we need stronger privacy protections on social media.

Firstly, sharing personal information can put us in danger. We never know who is looking at our profiles and what they might do with our information. For example, a stranger might see where we live and come to our house. Or, they might use our phone number to call us and harass us. It's important to keep our personal information private so that we can stay safe.

Secondly, some people might use our personal information for fake things. They might make fake accounts and pretend to be us, or they might use our pictures and say they are someone else. This can be very harmful and it's not right that people can do this with our personal information.

Lastly, sharing personal information can be bad for our privacy. We should be able to keep our personal information private and not have to share it with anyone we don't want to. It's not right that social media companies can use our information for their own benefit without our permission.

I know some people might say that social media companies need our personal information to make their platforms better. But, they can still make their platforms better without using our personal information. They can use fake information or they can ask us if we want to share our information.

In conclusion, we need stronger privacy protections on social media. Sharing personal information can be dangerous, fake and bad for our privacy. We should be able to keep our personal information private and social media companies should respect that.

I hope you agree with me that we need stronger privacy protections on social media. Thank you for reading my essay.",1
"When it comes to working with a group, there are several benefits. One major benefit is the exchange of cultural knowledge between group members. Working in a group encourages people to learn from each other and to share both their commonalities and differences. It also encourages the development of communication and language skills, as it provides an often fun environment to practice the use of language in different contexts. Working with a group also provides support to each group member, as individuals learn from each other and share experiences. Furthermore, the effectiveness of group work in terms of learning has been demonstrated to be higher when compared to learning on an individual basis. On the other hand, one of the disadvantages of working with a group is that it can be time consuming and can lead to teamwork issues if proper guidelines are not followed.",1

imiting car usage is a great and helpful action if we do it together. It also has many benefits,, it prevents car congestion, leaves the amount of  pollution in the air,. Overall , limiting car usage is healthy for you . It allows you to walk and get to where u need to go. There are many other great reasons to why limitng car usage is good and important but these are just a few.

One reason why""limiting car usage"" is a big deal is because it reduces car congestion and car congestion leads to pollution little by little. For example in Source 2 ,Duffer states that Paris has more polluted air than any other European capitals, it had ""147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter""; meanwhile other cities had less than 120 . Car congestion also minimizes movement throughout the city.

Limiting car usage also slowly diminishes pollution in the air .Whenever the air that we breathe in is polluted , we are welcoming so many toxins into our body .Polluted air is very dangerous , especially for the little ones that breathe it in . It also can cause health problems. Air pollution also kills many of the living things on earth that we need to survive such as plants , etc.

Last but not least ""limiting your car usage "" is healthy for you , it allows you to walk and get where you need to go without relying on a vehicle. Also wlaking is good for you it helps you run better and work better. Also sometimes when using other means of transportation you get to where you need to go faster .

In conclusion there are many reasons why ""limiting car usage is important . Its not only important for you but also for the environment and those around you. And who knows walking probably is better .    ",0
"I am against the developement of ""Driverless Cars."" Although a driverless car may sound cool, or may change the world someday, there are some negatives that go along with the production of the car. Driverless cars would be an expensive thing to prouduce. It would cause human driveres to not pay attention as much as they need to, and traffic laws would need a lot of updating.

The car would not be completely driverless, in the text it reads ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over..."" With that being said, a driverless car wouldn't be the correct name for it. Another reason the production of these cars would not be a great idea, is the money. For the car to respond to the things it needs it would require massive upgrades to existing roads, which is not practical. Along with the road needing upgrades, the car would too. The car would need a whole lot of sensors, in the text it states, ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" As if the human body is the best driver in the world, I feel as putting most of the control in the car would not be a great idea. To get cars up to the proper state they need to be would cost a lot of money.

In a driverless car the ""driver"" would still need to be alert when ""driving the car."" The thought of having a driverless car would make people think they can text, eat, play games, and drink while driving. Yes you say, ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver,"" how reliable would those cameras be, they could easily go out, break, or mess with other signals.

The law is what is stopping these cars from being out on the road. Traffic laws are written in the assumption that a human driver has control at all times, not when there is an accident, construction, or busy traffic. Traffic laws can change frequently, but if these driverless cars were to become a thing, traffic laws would need changed abudantly. New laws would need to be set in place for liability in the case of an accident. How would you solve that? Who is at fault? The driver has control when it needs to, but the car is doing most of the work. The statement about the displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over, what if the driver can't get the displays to turn off.

In conclusion, the production of ""Driverless Cars"" should not continue. It will cost a whole lot of money to get existing roads up to pass an inspection. Along with the fact that the human behind the wheel in case need be could fall asleep, drinking, or texting and not paying attention could cause more accidents then needed. And finally take into matter all the changes traffic laws would have to make or change. It would be better to let humans driver themselves to where they need to be instead of some computer genorated car get me to my destination.",0
"Think of this, ""car-free cities"". To about 90 percent of Americans this idea may sound outrageously retarded. why? well, for those who own a car their car is extremely important to them because it's their form of transportation, but also think of the harm that cars have done in just the past decades. Our global warming levels have rose dramatically and cars are one of the so many reasons. Not just that, think of all the deaths that have been involved with car accidents. All this can be stopped if we learn how to manage our car usage.

I'm not saying that cars should be banned or not used at all in our country, but we most definitely do need to be less dependent on our cars. Some places have already started the movement of car-free cities like in VAUBAN, Germany. They have given up their cars and have adjusted to a whole new life style. In the article ""car-free cities"" paragraph 3, a women named Heidrun Walter shares her opinion. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not only can it be beneficial, but some people actually like the idea.

Now lets think of air pollution that has rose our global warming levels. If you were to ask someone ""what's the biggest reason for global warming""? The first thing that would come to mind to almost everyone would be air pollution caused by cars. This isn't just in the US, this is going on everywhere in the world, but some places are finding solutions for this problem. For example, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" paragraph 1, it says ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". That's a perfect example of limiting car usage that can be extremely beneficial to us and our earth.

Some people may ask, ""how can you limit your car usage"" Well, you can ride your bike to work, take public transportation, and also walk. Riding your bike to work or walking to where you need to go can be an advantage to yourself. Many Americans are so inactive due to their cars because it can take you anywhere, but if you go out and walk or ride a bike to where you're going you're helping yourself out, and no it's not like you have to do it every day, but its just a way that we can manage our car usage and it would be more helpful than you think.

If we all take that big step and want to make a difference to our earth and its air pollution, we can achieve it. We don't necessarily have to be ""car-free"" we just all have to learn how to manage our car usage to make the big help. There would be less air pollution, our global warming levels would drop, there could be less car accidents, and less deaths. These advantages of limiting our car usage could just about save our lives and our earth.     ",0
"I would hate driverless cars. Now the only reason why I would hate it is because, I love to drive it is one of my favorite things to do. I would not be able to enjoy that if we had driverless cars, I mean yeah it would be cool but whats the point you will be spending more money then having a car and driving it yourself. No offense to Sergey Brin or anything not trying to crush your dreams but you have to think, this idea takes time, money, people willing to drive, and the strange one on one contact of who will be driving. I personly would only like it is if it would just pull up for you yeah the car driving by it's self would be cool but thats with only the car no one else, see when I read driverless cars I think of someone driving you around like ""uber"", but I what I would like to see is what I saw in The Avengers 2 Age of Ultron when Tony Stark pressed the button on his key fab and his orange convertible Audi R8 drove out of the garage and pulled up next to him. Thats what I want to see a car that can drive it's self but if it can only roll up to you then I would like that to but having someone drive you around would be weird, if it was a limo now thats a different story but other then that, I personly think this is a bad idea until they can master the car that can drive it's self until then keep trying.",0
"Summer Project: Student-designed or Teacher-designed?

Many schools across the country have been questioning whether or not they should be assigning their students summer projects. It is understood that many schools believe that it will be a way for the students to continue their learning throughout their break. While schools should not assign projects over breaks because it takes away from the break itself, if they must be assigned, students should be able to pick what they would wish to accomplish. If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed because students can be creative in what they would like to do, they can demonstrate something that interests them, and they can be self-paced.

If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed so that students can be creative in what they choose to do. If students are given a self- designed project then they would be able to create that project however they choose and it would be more beneficial to their learning if they were able to do what they chose. There are endless possibilities on projects ones could do to demonstrate a topic such as: a poster, a slide show, a song, a movie, and so many more. If one is able to be creative with the project then they would work harder on it regardless of the break.

If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed so that students can demonstrate something that interests them. If students are given the option of what to do the project on then they would be more likely to complete it if they could do whatever topic they wished. Not only that but when they are given the choice they will be able to educate something that interests them. Students could do anything that may interest them; a cause, something they did not learn in school, or a topic they wish to have further learning about. Giving students a project over the summer seems somewhat cruel, however, when given the choice, students could have endless possibilities on what to do for said project.

If schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed so that the students have the opportunity to be self paced. Summer is supposed to be a break time to allow for rest and fun, so what child would want a project hanging over their head all summer. But if this project was able to be self-paced then it would allow for endless summer fun without the stress of deadlines. A self-paced project would allow for students to still enjoy summer because it is understood that vacations, traveling, work, and many other factors may get in the way. However with a self-paced project those factors would not get in the way. It is understood that some would argue that a deadline makes that child work, in some cases yes, however, most of the time it only allows for more unneeded stress that children do not need over the summer.

In conclusion if schools require students to complete summer projects they should be self-designed because students can be creative in what they would like to do, they can demonstrate something that interests them, and they can be self-paced. Not only would it allow for children to learn about something that they are interested in, but it also allows for good mental health over the summer due to the lack of extra unneeded stress. Having student-designed projects also allows for the students to have a voice in their school community and to feel heard if they are able to create a project for themselves. ",0
"Dear Principal Peters,

I am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy options that are being considered. Of the two choices, I believe that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones but requires them to be off during class time, is the better option for our school. Here are three reasons why:

Firstly, having phones available during free periods like lunchtime is beneficial for students. It allows us to keep in touch with friends and family outside of school through texts and calls. Given that the school day is long, keeping connected during breaks is important for many students' well-being and sense that we are not entirely cut off from the outside world during the day. 

Secondly, having phones at school but switched off during classes minimizes distractions while still permitting their limited use. Require phones to be out of sight and silenced eliminates disruptions to learning but eases the transition between school and non-school time. Policy 2 may seem stricter but could end up being counterproductive if students try to secretly use phones anyway. Policy 1 establishes clearer rules that are also lenient enough to realistically follow.

Finally, allowing phones supports students who rely on them for important alerts and messages. For example, some students help care for family members after school and need their phones on in case of emergencies. Phones are also useful for co-ordinating rides and activities with parents/guardians before and after school. Policy 1 reasonably accommodates these necessary communications without compromising academic priorities. 

In conclusion, Policy 1 strikes the right balance of student needs versus learning environment. It is permissive where phones do not interfere with learning but prohibitive where they could. I believe it is the policy most appropriate for our school. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration,
[Your name]",1
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay!  So, the current educational system is like, totally fine and all, but have you guys heard about this four-day school week with an extended two hours thingy?  I think it's like, really interesting and stuff, so I'm gonna analyze it and see if it's like, actually a good idea or not. 🤔

First of all, let's talk about the advantages of a four-day school week.  One of the main benefits is that it gives students more time to like, you know, relax and recharge their batteries.  I mean, we're already in school for like, eight hours a day, which is like, a long time. So, having an extra day off would be like, super nice. Plus, it could help us be more focused and stuff when we are in school. 

But, there are also some disadvantages to consider.  One of them is that it could be harder for students to like, balance their schedules and stuff.  Like, if we have an extended school day, it could be harder to fit in extracurricular activities and stuff. And, it could also be harder for parents to like, you know, get us to school on time and stuff. 

And, let's talk about the potential impact on students achieving their academic goals.  I think it could be like, both good and bad.  On the one hand, having more time in school could help us learn more and stuff.  But, on the other hand, it could also be like, harder to focus and stuff if we're already in school for longer. 

So, like, overall, I think the four-day school week with an extended two hours is like, a pretty interesting idea.  But, we should definitely consider all the pros and cons before making a decision.  Like, it could be like, really good for some people, but bad for others. *",1
"Phones and Driving

Cell phones and cars are not a good mix and people should never try and use both at the same time. Using both phone and car at the same time can cause a major accident and can cause people to get hurt because someone wanted to use their phone while they drove their car. When you use your phone while driving you are putting more than yourself at risk of losing your life you also endanger the person you crash into and whoever you or they have in the car. When these two items mix it is no good for anybody especially the ones on the street.

The world is a very exciting place and there is so much to do and can even do multiple things at once, but somethings shouldn't be done while another is happening. Being on your phone while driving is one of the many things you shouldn't do it causes accidents that will leave someone badly damaged or without their life. When someone loses their life their family will grieve and you shouldn't want to be the cause of their or your family's grief so you should take precautions that you stay out of situations that could put you in the wrong spotlight.

On average 11 teens die a day from texting and driving. These are people who just wanted to see what their friends had to say or what's trending on instagram. As sad as it is, these people didn't take good precautions before they took off in the car, they just wanted to arrive at the location they were headed too. They didn't think that they were going to lose their life from texting and driving. People should learn from others' mistakes and shouldn't text and drive knowing it is dangerous.

There are over 2.35 million people in the United States today that are injured or disabled due to a car crash, and there are more than 330,000 of those accidents due to Texting and driving. When a person text while driving there is never a good outcome of them doing that a young teen or an older person or there self ends up getting hurt in the process. The generation today's technology has drastically increased. People are so reliant on the use of their phones and more things. Nowadays a lot of people don't even like to have a phone conversation simply because they can send it through a text. The conclusion of all the car wrecks the accident is mostly caused by a person wanting to text while driving .

The purpose of this essay is to give you some information on why you shouldn't text and drive at the same times. People always think they have to immediately have to respond to a text this is why many of the accidents occur. The ages that always cause accidents are the teens the ages from 17 and up they always act like soon as they hear that ding they have to check their phone. Don't text and drive text there is never a good outcome of that, think about your life and others. Text and drive doesn't mix you need your eyes on the road you can not text and drive, don't even think about picking your phone up. If you even think about picking your phone up just pause and think about how many lives you will be putting at risk by picking up your phone.

"Some schools require students to complete a summer project during their break to make sure they are continuing their learning. However, it is discussed whether these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Both types offer their benefits and disadvantages. On the one hand their is the student's choice, on the other their is the teacher's idea of how the end product should look like. Summer projects should be student-designed because this would allow for students to choose their projects, making them better, although they may not know exactly what they will be learning in the coming year.

If students are allowed to choose their projects, they will be better. During summer break, students like to relax and do activities they are interested in. If they have to do a school project, they may not mind as much if it is something they are passionate about. This interest in what they are doing would cause them to make a better project, rather then if they had to just do a project they were assigned to. This could also allow for further learning caused by the project since they would be looking up new information. It could also have students remember what they have learned longer because it is something they take interest in. Students who are allowed to do projects they chose will make a better project that has also enhanced their learning.

One problem that might arise with a student-designed project is that they might not have full knowledge of the course material they will be learning after the summer. While their project might be very good, and they may have learned a lot of new information, they may not have learned or gone over the topics that will be discussed in class. They may have also not completed the project to the particular standards their new teacher has. While it may be a valid concern that students might not complete the project to the exact standards of the teacher, it is still preferable for students to design their own projects. If the teacher or school designs the projects, it may cause disinterest in the students to complete the project altogether. Also, while the student's projects might not be exactly what the teacher hoped for, they would accomplish the stated goal of continuing their learning over the summer. It could also give the teacher an opportunity early on in the year to correct the students where the may have gone wrong, and a rubric could be provided initially so students know how their project will be graded. Even though students might not know all of the course material they will be studying, they would still produce good projects and their projects would accomplish the stated goal of learning over the summer.

A self-designed project would make students more interested and thus more likely to learn over summer break. This would be preferable to a teacher-designed project because the teacher might assign a topic that is not interesting to the student and they might not learn or complete the assignment. If the topic is something the students are passionate about, then they will remember what they learned better then if they were assigned the project. It might also cause them to enjoy the project, which could increase their future desire for learning and being interested in school-related activities. Most students are under the impression that academic subjects are boring, but if they could complete a project that they enjoy, then this impression could be altered.",0
"Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is no surprise that they are also used in the classroom. While the use of cell phones in the classroom has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks. In this essay, we will investigate how students' use of cell phones in the classroom affects their ability to learn, research the safety risks to students when phones are allowed inside the classroom, examine the potential benefits of students utilizing cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom, look into laws or regulations about cell phone use in the classroom in other countries, and assess potential measures the school could take to protect against inappropriate use of phones.

Firstly, the use of cell phones in the classroom can be distracting to students. Studies have shown that students who use cell phones in the classroom are more likely to miss important information and have a harder time focusing on the lesson. This can lead to a decrease in their ability to learn and retain information. Additionally, cell phones can be a source of distraction for other students, as they may be tempted to check their own phones or talk to their peers.

Secondly, there are safety risks to students when phones are allowed inside the classroom. For example, students may be at risk of physical harm if they are using their phones and not paying attention to their surroundings. Additionally, cell phones can be used to bully or harass other students, which can have negative effects on their mental health.

However, there are also potential benefits to students utilizing cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom. For example, cell phones can be used to access educational apps and games that can help students learn in a fun and interactive way. Additionally, cell phones can be used to collaborate with other students and teachers, allowing for more effective communication and teamwork.

In other countries, there are laws and regulations about cell phone use in the classroom. For example, in some schools in the United States, cell phones are not allowed in the classroom at all, while in others, they are allowed but only during specific times. In other countries, such as Japan, cell phones are not allowed in the classroom at all, and students are required to leave them at the door.

To protect against inappropriate use of phones, the school could take several measures. For example, they could implement a policy that restricts the use of cell phones during certain times of the day, or they could require",1
"The author suggests that Venus would be a worth-while investment, thus might bring in interesting facts about our Sister Planet. Hence NASA and our government will make a lot of money for bringing in crucial information about Venus. From here on in there will be many facts on why exploring Venus will be a worth-while investment.

Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star"", since it is so easy to see at night, and our ""Sister Planet"", is a very difficult place to study. The size of Venus is why it is known as our Sister Planet, it has almost the same density, mass, and size of Earth. But on the contrast, its atmosphere is very different from ours. The atmosphere on the planet has many storms that are highly electrical ,hence, lightning can strike a craft out of the sky. And the atmosphere is made up of 97% carbon dioxide. The blankets of carbon dioxide make it hard to see into the planet. The clouds of carbon dioxide on the planet are highly corrosive because of sulfuric acid. Any craft made of any type of metal will melt in about roughly 2-3 days depending on the size of the craft. The Atmospheric pressure on the planet is about 90 times greater than we experience on Earth. The temperature on the ground averages over 800 degrees Farenheit.

But NASA has developed an idea that might truely get humans close to Venus to be able to study it. NASA says that they could send a craft to float or hover about 30 or so miles above the surface to escape the harsh Venusian storms and landscape. At thirty miles above the surface it would be around 170 degrees Farenheit and the pressure that high would be somewhat like sea level here on Earth. Solar power would also be beneficial for power and radiation would not exceed what we experience on Earth. But because of the dense clouds not letting most light forms into the inner atmosphere it would hinder insight of the surface. Thus rendering the photography and videography unavailable. They plan to use mechanical computers that run because of gears and levers and would not require electronics. These forms of computers were used during World War II because they did not require electricity and how they are capable of withstanding much punishment from harsh conditions.

This concludes how it would be a worth-while pursuit to study Venus, and how NASA will help with the studying of our Sister Planet. ",0
"While distance learning offers flexibility, I believe students would benefit more from attending classes in person at school. There are a few key reasons for this. 

First, attending school in person allows for valuable interaction and collaboration with teachers and classmates. In a physical classroom, students can more easily ask questions, participate in group work, and bounce ideas off one another. Distance learning, even with video conferencing, is still limited compared to face-to-face engagement. Students learn a great deal from participating in lively discussions and hands-on projects with others. 

Second, being at school helps students focus and stay on track better than learning from home. It can be too easy to become distracted when studying at home, whether by chores, pets, or other electronics. Schools provide dedicated spaces conducive to learning without these types of distractions. This environment makes it simpler for students to concentrate fully on their lessons and stay on task. 

Third, attending school fosters important social and emotional skills. Students interact with many different people, learn to solve conflicts, and develop self-discipline through routines like attending all classes. These types of skills are difficult to acquire without regular social interaction from an early age. Distance learning may not provide the same opportunities for social development as in-person school. 

In summary, while distance learning offers flexibility that appeals to some, students overall would benefit more from attending physical classes at their schools. The in-person interactions, focus, and social development available at school better support students' education and growth during these formative years. With teachers and administrators providing engaging lessons, I believe the classroom experience cannot be replaced by online alternatives.",1
"What if you could take all those boring, uncomfortable classes you have at school in the comfort of your own home? Now learning by way of online or video conferencing is a reality. A lot of students have the opportunity to attend all their regular classes at home rather than being at school. The question that arises now is: which learning environment benefits students more? Learning in school benefits students more because there's less distractions, it is more personal, and also more reliable.

One reason students learning in school is more beneficial to them is because there are less distractions in a school classroom then there are in the student's house. Since they are in their own house, they might get too comfortable and slack off because they won't be caught, or they can simply not pay attention to the lesson and the teacher wouldn't be able to notice them. An example of this happening is a student could be working on their bed and can feel tired for a second, then instead of finishing what they were doing for school they could fall asleep right there. In a classroom setting, if a student was dozing off or about to fall asleep, the teacher would wake them up to make sure they dont miss any of the important material of the class they are in.

Another reason students learning in school is more beneficial to them is because it has a more personal connection between teacher and student. If a student is taking classes online there is a good chance that the teacher doesn't even know it unless it is a one-on-one teaching session where it is only the teacher and the student. This means students that need extra help and students that want to ask questions can't because they aren't there to talk to the teacher directly. If I wanted to meet my teacher after class because of something I didn't understand during class time, I would be able to because I can just walk up to them and ask; however, if i wasn't present in the classroom I wouldn't be able to ask for that extra help. This puts students who have trouble learning at a disadvantage. If a student is struggling with something, a teacher can visibly see that and go help; however, if the student is struggling online the teacher wouldn't notice at all and the student would have to do more work than necessary.

The last reason students learning in school is more beneficial than learning online is because learning in a classroom is a lot more reliable. Technology is very good and can do a lot of things people can't, but they also are less reliable at some times. Technical difficulties can happen to a student using their device all day for classes that can take a long time to finish. There are a whole lot of things that could go wrong when using a device to learn such as: a student misplacing their device and can't find it in time for the class, the device dying from lack of charging before the lesson, a random malfunction or update that could interfere with the device during the lesson, etc.. All of these events are likely to happen to a student who is constantly using their device everyday for long periods of time. Instead of risking things like this to happen, coming into the classroom itself is the most reliable way of learning for a student.

While some people believe students learning online is better because students are more comfortable than they would be in a classroom and it's more convenient for them; learning in a classroom is still better. Being able to have less distractions in a classroom, having a more personal connection with the teacher, and it just being more reliable than using technology, makes learning in the classroom the most beneficial way of learning for students in school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ",0
"A world without cars is a world we should all want to live in. Participating in this worldwide fad has been known to benefit the lives of those among us. Thus, causing a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, as well as a decrease in pollution, and beneficial effects on carbon emissions. The advantages of limiting car usage are increasing daily, and cutting your time spent driving may have a positive effect on not only your life but your families, and those surrounded by you.

Traveling across the world to Germany, you will find Vauban. A well-known, upscale community where more and more soccer moms and commuting executives are giving up their cars. This experimental, new district has generally forebidden street parking, driveways, and home garages. Therefore seventy percent of the residents in this community do not have cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move to this ecofriendly habitat. One resident, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car, I was always tense, I'm much happier now."" The atomosphere of this residence has a positive effect on stress, meaning it decreases it! The vibe of walking down a street filled with the swish of bicycles passing by, and the chatter of wandering children has lowered the stress of nearly all residents. This ecofriendly, and stress-free enviroment is a trend that is growing and being adopted by many countries, including the U.S. From Chicago to Shanghai, this residential area may be the place for you.

Paris, France, home to the famous Eiffel Tower even has its pollution problems. After days of uncontrollable smog, the ruling French party enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of thiis well-known city. They ruled that on Monday's even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and on Tuesdays, odd-numbered license plates were to do so as well. After this first trial, the congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France. This was a huge success since Paris typically has more pollution that other European capitals. Temporary laws like this have a huge effect on reducing the amount of pollution in crowded cities. Even the city of love has unclean air, how romantic is that? Limiting the usage of cars benefited this society immensely, and it could benefit our world as a whole if all of us chose to cut back our car usage at least twice a week.

Automobiles are the Beyonce of suburbs, where families from California all the way to Sydney tend to make their homes. Experts have concluded that this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes all around the world. Passenger cars in Europe are only responsible for twelve percent of these emissions, while America is responsible for up to fifty percent. President Obama's goals to drastically curb these greenhouse gas emissions will be assisted by a shift in American behavior: Fewer Americans getting their license. Studies have shown less and less of Americas youth are prioritizing getting their license. If this pattern persists, it will have a beneficial effect on the reduction of carbon emissions being released into the environment. This calls for less pollution, and a more ecofriendly, healthy society for us all.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in your daily life can cause a drastic change. These changes include a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, to less pollution, and a beneficial effect on carbon emissions. Our society as a whole has the opportunity to reduce car usage, so why not grab it while we have the chance. A healthier environment calls for a healthier you.         ",0
"While attending a public/traditional school have very good benefits, some people don't do well in regular school enviornments. Having the option to take classes from home has bnefits that apeal to to people that dont learn well under normal learning circumstances.

If your someone that works or have other duties that get in the way of going to school, online classes gives you that flexability to learn from your home and so start and finish day-to-day lessons. Online classes also aliviates some the stress of balancing classes. Things like school events wather and days off won't effect your learning progression which makes finishing classes alot easier which gives you more time for other activities.

While online classes have great benefits there are some downsides. Most of the work is on you to comprehend, complete, and turn in on time. You also will be Isolated from other people and expiriences you can only have in a regular school. But while these are true they are easy to overcome if you are focused and determined.

Students all over the U.S. fail to do well in school because the types of benefits traditional school gives do not benefit the student(s) in the areas needed and in the the way that insures the most productive learning experience. Having alternative ways to gain accses to classes gives people that dont have the time to commute to a school a way to consistenly learn at there own pace.",0
"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",0
"Dear senator,

We should change the electoral college to an election by popular votes for the president of the united states.

I believe that everyone should have a say in who their future president should be not just a group of selected officials . Sure some of the peoples choices may end up bias or thoughtless but atleast they get to feel as if their a part of the state. like stated in ""what's wrong with the electoral college"" sentence 11 ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" meaning that sometimes the chosen electors neglect their positions and use it the wrong way. The selcted electors may end up going against the people and/or choose a bias decision. No matter how you look at it their still human and they will make mistakes.

Electoral college shouldn't only allow government official or ""qualified"" citizens to bare that huge responsibility because if they make one wrong move then everyone will blame them but if we have popular vote everyone will have a say in the presidential voting. If we have electoral votes your only giving specific people power while as the other citizens sit down to watch complete stranges balance their countries future in their hands. like stated in ""what's wrong with electoral college"" sentence 13 ""At the most basic level ,the electoral college is unfair to voters"" meaning that electoral votes is unjustified to the people.

Electoral votes should be abolished because it isn't justified for all of those hardworking citizens who always pay their respects to this country. It even states in ""what's wrong with electoral college"" sentence 14 "" It's official : The electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational."" meaning that the electoral college has been here long enough, it's not justified ,and it's irrational. Something like that should no longer exist. The citizens should have a say in who will become their new president. They should have a majority vote .

Like stated in ""choosing the president"" sentence 15 ""the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism""meaning that the electoral college is really old and we no longer have any need for it. The electoral college is something that was meant for the past. There may have been some sort of issue that they could not properly deal with ,so they created the electoral college in order to deal with it. But now we have more advance ways of doing stuff so we don't need electoral college any more . We can now change our ways for voting so that it'll match our time and period.

Electoral votes is filled with holes/bias. So we should find a new way of chosing our new president who is willing to change our couontry for the best and not corrupt our country.    ",0
"Ever thought of driverless cars? Sergey Brin (google cofounder) has and envisions that public trnasportation will be equipped with this new found technology in the near future. Driverless cars are very convient, they are saught after, but have not gotten far with awmakers. What do you think of cars that require little human help?

Driverless cars are extremely convienient. Firstly, the cars can handle most driving functions at 25 mph. For example, they can steer, accelerate, and break. Yes, they do still need human interractions for accidents on the road and work zones. Secondly, the GM have invented vibrating seats for whenever the car may be in danger. This is very helpful for people who may overlook a pedestrian walking behind the car. Lastly, flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays are at work for the driverless car. These details from the prompt show why the driverless car is a steal.

The driverless car has was first braught up by smart roads. Firstly, smart roads like the one first invented by General Motors, was the first step to driverless cars. Engineers made an electrical cable track specifically desgined sense where the car was. Secondly Toyota Prious used postion estimating sensing to calculate where the car may be on the road. Lastly, in the 1980's, automakers used speed sensors for anti lock wheels. These details from the article show how this smart car was brought up and experimented on.",0
"Achieving goals is a crucial part of life, and it's something that students at every age should learn about. For elementary school students, setting and achieving goals can be a challenging but rewarding experience. In this presentation, I will discuss the key points of achieving goals and provide some tips on how to set and achieve them.

The first step in achieving a goal is to set it. This may seem like an obvious step, but it's essential to take the time to think about what you want to achieve. When setting a goal, it's important to make it specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This will help you stay focused and motivated as you work towards your goal.

For example, if you want to improve your reading skills, your goal could be to read a certain number of books or to improve your reading speed. By making your goal specific, you can create a clear plan for how to achieve it.

Once you've set your goal, the next step is to stay motivated. Motivation can be tricky, especially for young students who may not have a lot of life experience. One way to stay motivated is to remind yourself of why you set the goal in the first place. For example, if your goal is to improve your reading skills, you may be motivated by the desire to read more interesting books or to impress your teachers.

Another way to stay motivated is to break your goal down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will help you feel like you're making progress towards your goal, even if it seems like a long way away.

Finally, it's important to remember that achieving a goal can be difficult and that it's okay to not give up. It's normal to encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way, but it's important to keep pushing forward. One way to do this is to seek help from others. Whether it's a teacher, parent, or friend, having someone to support you and offer advice can be incredibly helpful.

In conclusion, achieving goals is an important part of life, and it's something that elementary school students should learn about. By setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals, staying motivated, and not giving up, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Remember, the journey to achieving",1
"The Castle Standard is a concept that emphasizes striving for excellence in whatever one does. This could mean going above and beyond standards, pushing boundaries, and working diligently to reach a higher level of excellence. For example, an individual striving for excellence could be a young student who works hard to get the highest grades in their class. They might set their own, higher expectations and work diligently to achieve them.

Determination is an essential part of reaching any goal. It involves unwavering commitment and a strong will to succeed in spite of any challenges one may face. An example of determination is a marathon runner who continues running even when their body is exhausted. Despite their fatigue, they have the willpower to cross the finish line.

Goal-setting is an important tool for growth and progress. By setting realistic yet challenging goals, and working diligently towards them, one can slowly but surely reach their destination. An example of how one can reach their goals is a student who sets the goal of passing a tricky exam. Through persistent effort, study, and practice, the student is able to pass the test – and reach their goal.

In conclusion, the Castle Standard is a concept focusing on striving for excellence and going above and beyond the basic requirements. Determination and goal-setting are key to reaching any goal, no matter how big or small, and progress is encouraged when realistic yet challenging targets are set. By remaining determined and focused on their goals, individuals can achieve anything.",1
"Limiting car usage has many advantages, from saving money, from helping save the planet. We spend tons and tons of dollars on a simple fossil fuel just so we can get around. Although, having a car may be nice, but also you may need to think about the long term consequences that are yet to come. For example, driving around while fun, is dangerous, you are facing the threats of drunk drivers, people not paying attention or something in general going wonky with your car, or how incredibly expensive cars are, you must buy the gas fill it up almost every two days, you will have to pay for any damages and also for the tune ups. Cars arent just expensive but they also do loads of damage to the environment. Cars, create fumes that are let out into the atmosphere that contributes to global warming. Sure, it may be nice to fdrive a big bubba truck with huge tires, some smoke stacks and to be able to ""roll coal"" but also think about what that does to the earth, it helps melt glaciers causing polar bears to be hot and hungry.

Driving a car may be convenient, but when something is convenient something else has to suffer. This something else would be the environent, there is less and less clean air for us to breathe, everything is getting hotter and everyone is suffering. Smog is one of the most relavent and visible issues, especially in bigger cities. Smog is a mixture of smoke, and fog, this smoke coming from vehicles and mostly factories. Going into a major city like New York City may be fun but while your there look around and notice the thick layer of smog. You are breathing all of that through out your body. While New York City may not be the smoggiest city around such as Beijing (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, Line 14) but it is still an on going issue everywhere.

All in all, leaving your car at home and taking a bike to work instead can have many health benefits but also many environmental benifits, so next time you think about bringing your car to work, think of the polar bears and the future of the environment.            ",0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But I don't think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many reasons that the students could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument.

Firstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they don't know. And if someone who dont' teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they don't help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didn't go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it doesn't have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didn't study as well as can't catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you can't study by yourself, It couldn't help you that learn.

Also, the students can't communicate with other students. It means that the student can't study with other students that they can't make some friends and could not be an active just like some other students. Also, it will be impact their behaviour that they'll be more lonely. Because the students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online and video conferencing benefit for the students.

On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesn't have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we don't have to hold one point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we don't have to demand to do only one way, they might be more interest with the online, video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home.

In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone. Therefore, the student might think very well to thier option to to attend classes from the home.         ",0
"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advantages such as reducing pollution, increasing safety for human beings, and even opening options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of pollutants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with hepburn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vehicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay 40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined 31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public announcement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleaner. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familiar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vehicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases safety, bumping into another human or being nudged by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.",0
"Title: The Power of Self-Reliance: Unlocking Success through Personal Responsibility

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I've learned that self-reliance is a crucial aspect of success. It's about taking responsibility for our own lives and actions, rather than relying on others. In this essay, I'll explore the concept of self-reliance, how it defines success, and the different ways to become more self-reliant. I'll also highlight famous people who have used self-reliance to achieve their goals and discuss the dangers of not prioritizing it.

Research:
Self-reliance is the ability to take care of oneself and one's responsibilities without relying on others. It involves being proactive, resourceful, and accountable for our actions. According to an article by Forbes, self-reliance is a key factor in achieving success, as it allows individuals to take control of their lives and make decisions that align with their goals and values.

Brainstorming Ideas:
To become more self-reliant, I can start by setting clear goals and working towards them. This means identifying what I want to achieve and creating a plan to make it happen. I can also practice self-care by taking care of my physical and mental health, which is essential for overall well-being. Additionally, I can learn new skills and take on new challenges to expand my knowledge and abilities.

Famous People:
Many successful people have used self-reliance to achieve their goals. For example, Oprah Winfrey, a billionaire media executive and philanthropist, credits her success to her self-reliance and determination. She started her career as a radio host and worked her way up to become one of the most influential women in media. Another example is Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, who has become a pioneer in the tech industry through his self-reliance and innovative thinking.

Dangers of Not Prioritizing Self-Reliance:
If we don't prioritize self-reliance, we risk wasting money and engaging in negative behavior. For instance, relying on others for financial support",1
"Dear Florida senator, I'm a young student, and no I don't haye much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I belieye it does.

Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral yotes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't yoting for a President but we're yoting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just yoting for those electors, we are yoting for the whole idea behind their campaigning. We don't yote for the person, we yote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By haying this process, we can focus on getting swing states yotes. The yotes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in "" In Defense of the Electoral College: Fiye reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President "", ""swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election."" This helps ayoid runon elections because the small states are likey to just yote for the most popular President, knowing their yote won't really make a difference.

Most states haye a ""winnertakeall"" system that giyes all of the electors to the winning candidate. Howeyer, there are a few states that haye yariation with the ""proportional representation"" idea. The ""winnertakeall"" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to giye all of the yotes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process y. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidential process one step easier.

And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article "" What Is the Electoral College?

"" states that, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a yote in Congress and election of the President by a popular yote of qualified citizens."" The process we created as the United States, has its up and downs but it is one of the longest standing traditions we haye. Hopefully you take my letter in to consideration. Thank you for reading.",0
"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It was a great opportunity, and I got to do so many things that an average small town boy would normally never do.

I met new friends, helped out people and their countries, and got to visit so many amazing places.

I loved that I got to see all the sites.

I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, saw the Acropolis in Greece, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

It was so unbelievably marvolous that I made nine whole trips of exploring and being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times, and the Pacific Ocean twice.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will be able to do everything that I did, maybe even much more.

If you aren't already convinced, with getting to explore and tour many parts of the world, then you should know this.

With joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you get to help people and their countries' needs.

After World War 2 there is a lot to recover from in Europe and many parts of the world.

By joining us and working for the UNRRA you would be helping by taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules being shipped overseas to the needy countries.

If you like animals and don't get sea sick too easy, I say you join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Going on this journey made me more aware of people of their countries and their needs.

It changed me in a wonderful way, and it will do the same to you.

The new friends, exploration, sites to see, and people to take care of is just a few of the reasons to consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

You would be not only helping the needy, but you'd also be helping yourself become a better person.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is an eye-opening experience, and I strongly encourage you to take part in the journey.",0
"Can there be life on Mars? The answer is NO! How can there be life on mars without food, water, plants, and oxygen. For a human to live on Mars they would have to bring a life supply on food and water, but you can't have a life supply of oxygen. So there can not be life on mars.

The Face on Mars is not a really face. There can not be life on Mars. First, aliens are not real. Second, there is no oxgyen. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" states ""huge rock formation.... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth.""

The Face on Mars only happen one time. Another aircraft went back at the same degress and a cloudy day just like the one before. When it took the picture there was just a landform. This aircraft even had a better camera and took even more pictures.

The article says "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Gavin says "" It reminds me most of Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an islated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

That is why the Face on Mars is just a landform not a alien or an alien made it. It was just a illusion not anthing else.",0
" Living life on your own terms is one of the most rewarding experiences one can have. In a world that often tries to shape us into something we're not, it takes courage and determination to remain true to ourselves. While it may be difficult to navigate through the challenges and obstacles that come our way, the reward of achieving success and fulfillment is well worth the effort.

One of the most important aspects of being true to ourselves is to never give up, even when faced with adversity. It's easy to become discouraged and lose hope when things don't go as planned, but it's important to remember that setbacks are just temporary roadblocks on the path to success. Instead of giving up, we should use these setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow.

Another key aspect of being true to ourselves is to be humble and compassionate towards others. We should never forget that everyone has their own struggles and challenges to overcome, and we should always try to help and support those in need. By showing kindness and empathy towards others, we can not only make a positive impact on their lives, but also strengthen our own character and values.

Finally, it's important to stay true to our own beliefs and values, even when faced with pressure or criticism from others. We should never compromise our integrity or compromise our beliefs for the sake of fitting in or pleasing others. Instead, we should stand up for what we believe in and fight for what we know is right.

In conclusion, being true to ourselves is the key to achieving success and fulfillment in life. By never giving up, being humble and compassionate towards others, and staying true to our own beliefs and values, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve our goals. So, let's live the life we love and love the life we live, and never forget that our happiness is inside us, all we have to do is look for it.",1
"Although schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough, actually students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students have more time to sleep and the opportunity of more healthy food.

Some schools said students should not attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. For example, a teacher said students are more lazy and Generic_Name said students don't take classes seriously. In my opinion I think that taking classes at home will be a big problem because students don't do what they supposed to do and also some time students just look at Google to answer what the teacher told to them. Students are not working hard to get want they want, some just said i want to be this or that but they don't put effort in on.

Schools believe that students who take classes at home by way of online or video conferencing are not learning enough. For example, people think students become more interested in other things because they are at home and they can do whatever they want. Generic_Name said that students don't do homework when they attend to an school ,they will not do it at home either. In my opinion all that this people are saying is true because students don't see that what they are doing now can affect they life in the future, because if they to have a diploma they will never have a good job. I think that those schools that want students to take classes at home are making students to be more lazy than they are.

Although some schools said students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students need more time to sleep. A reason is that students need to rest they mind so students can be prepare for the next day of class. Another reason is that students need to sleep at least 9 hours because they always went to bed late. In my opinion students need to sleep well because it is good for our self to sleep the correct hours not too little and not too much.

At this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food. A example is that the president said that all the students have the right to have a good nutrition. A doctor also said students need a good nutrition because having a good nutrition students can absorb all the learning process. In my opinion this is a good idea because student can have a better nutrition at they on home. Having a good nutrition will make students more strong and they will be able to do many things.

In my position i think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will never put interest in what the need to do. This idea will just cause problems because is a lie that students will be connected to computer to take the classes. It is not the same to take classes at home that at school because at school students can ask the teacher if they have a question and teacher do what ever she/he need to do to make sure students understand it. To give students the opportunity have classes at home is like give students the option to take classes or not. I believe that finishing schools is a great goal in life is like the firth step to more big stuffs.

Some schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. I think that is the best because is not good for the students to take classes at home. Those schools who believe students should not take classes at home is because they want the beast for all the students.     ",0
"Do you find after school activities important? I think that every student should do at least one extracurricular activity. Because the schools provide activities that deal with sports, technology, and help students decide what career they want to take on. Sports can help you stay healthy and fit, while some of the other activities help you with school.

For Example, if a student tries out for track, but he's a little overweight, but he enjoys the sport so he starts to run and exercise to lose weight. The same can happen with a underweight kid, they could be wrestling and decide to work out to get stronger to win matches. There are so many sports anyone could enjoy at school. They even provide the top 3 sports in the U.S. such as basketball, football, and soccer.

But However, students can get injured and harmed in these sports. They can get teased, bullied, or even picked on if others don't think they're not good enough at the sport. So if the student doesn't enjoy sports they can can do other activities such as coding, yearbook planning, etc. These programs focus more on educational things they don't learn in school. So if a student does coding they can learn to design mods and create things with a computer. The child may want to design a game and become an Game designer because of this.

In Conclusion, the activities provided at school should be participated in by every student. These programs could create a pathway for a students career. They probably want to be a professional sports player or a engineer what ever they think is best for them. Also they can get exercise, knowledge, and even social time. Everyone should do an extracurricular activity. ",0
"Dear Principal,

The community is very important to us. Some students find that community service is necessary while others are unsure. In my opinion, community service should be required of students attending school, because it will help towards the cleanliness of the community and benefits of different citizens. Since the community is so important to us, why shouldn't it be clean, or why shouldn't those who need help, get it? Volunteering can be done in a number of ways. For example, roads can quickly become filled with trash. How can we help this if we don't have enough workers? We can undertake with community service. With the help of the students at school we can help lead the community to a safe, clean, enjoyable place to live. Could you imagine living with trash everywhere? The problem could easily be solved. Students should be required to pick an option to help the community. For example, tutoring elementary school kids can be very beneficial. While helping younger students, you can learn more by reviewing what you have already learned and teaching yourself skills on working with others. Another way to volunteer is by working at an animal shelter. Many animals that do not already have homes are left by themselves in kennels, daily. Why shouldn't they be taken care of, or played with? One can devote themselves to doing something they love, while also playing a huge part in society. Overall, students should be required to devote time to community service. With just a little help from people, you can make a big change.

Sincerely,

Student",0
"Dear Principal,

Most people feel good when they help other people, and they do it as often as they can. They might be a volunteer at a soup kitchen, donate money, pick up litter, help someone put up their groceries, or any other community service. Volunteering is a great way to help the community and anyone can do it, however volunteering is called volunteering for a reason. When you volunteer, you're willing to give up your time to help someone else. You shouldn't force someone to volunteer for community service. Volunteering is a choice. That's why it's called ""volunteer.""

Some people might want to help out, but they don't have time. They could have a job after school, plus have to do all of the homework required by your teachers. If you force students to perform a service, they might not be able to reach there highest point academically because they're so bogged down with a to-do list. Students would get too stressed out with everything they have to do. Stress isn't good physically or mentally, and that could cause grades to go down. Not having to do community service would give students more time for studying and other things like an after-school sport or club. If you want more kids to participate in extra-curricular things, you can't add another burden onto their shoulders. You know what they say, All work and no play...

Helping out the community is very important, but community service isn't the only way for a person to help out in the community. Most people recycle, or donate old clothes to a local charity. A recent survey showed that starting a recycling or donating program at our school would have a lot more willing participants than required community service would. In fact, 90% of the student population said they would love to help out with my proposed programs, whereas only 40% would be willing to volunteer for a service. Donating and recycling, or another idea you may have that's easy do to and doesn't take too much time, would be just as helpful to the community as volunteer work would be.

People who have the time for volunteering can and will do it on their own. I would encourage students to take part in community service, but sometimes, people just don't have the ability to. There is no need for you to require community service in our school. Don't force students to be a volunteer, because then it just wouldn't be volunteering. They wouldn't be as willing to do the service, and they might not do the job as well as they would if they did it by choice, and the community service would be a waste of time if the helper didn't do it right or well enough. That's just common sense. Please consider my suggestions, and thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

"The Seagonig Cowboys are a group of people who helped serve after World War 2. They brought horses and small cows to towns that were in ruins. To help these countrys they brought food and cattle. They went across the Pacific and Atlantic ocean to give the homeless food.

People should join this program because it help a town in need of assistance. If they didnt they could starve to death. They need to join this program not just for the people you are helping but to help yourself see the good inside yourself. Take Luke, he is a seagoing cowboy that made 9 trips. That is the longest any seagoing cowboy has ever went.

It clearly states on paragraph 5 that "" Besides helping people, I had a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" He also says it is an oppertunity of a lifetime. He said he couldnt say no. He says it takes about 2 weeks to get across the Alantic ocean. He went over the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the Pacific ocean twice to help those affected by World War 2.

In conclusion, people should join the seagoing cowboys. There are many side benifits of doing so. You could things you could never see and still help people. So, will you join the seagoing cowboys?",0
"Have you ever wanted to be a seagoing cowboy? I got a chance to. It was a lot of fun. My friend convinced me to do it. You should do it also.

A seagoing cowboy is a person who takes care of animals while they are being shipped overseas. The job is to feed the animals, wash the animals, water the animals, and clean the stalls. We also get breaks. We get to go sightseeing and do things that other cultures do. The job can be hurtful. If there is a storm, the boat will get slippery and you can fall. I almost fell over board once. It was scary.

You should get this job because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Plus, the animals are well behaved and they would love to have new people. If you love to go see places in other countries, you should get this job. If you want hard work, this job would be perfect. In your free time, you can play games, read, or whittle something.

According to the article, the job is a once in a lifetime event. Based on the passage, I got to see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, a castle in Crete, and I got to see the Panama Canal. In paragraph six, it states that my job keeps me busy. Helping out on a farm or working a tough job can prepare you for the hard work. Those are some reasons of why you should be a seagoing cowboy.

Being a seagoing cowboy has some up's and down's, but overall the job is a lot of fun. You get to experience and see so many things. Sometimes, it doesn't feel like work at all. It feels like fun. A whole lot of it. Now do you want to be a seagoing cowboy?",0
"Hey Generic_Name I said, ""i need help i'm stuck in this problem right now."" Generic_Name answered and said, ""what's up."" I said, ""i need help i'm trying to get a job but i don't know where i should work."" Generic_Name said, ""just go work at Generic_Name because they give benefits."" i agreed with him and went home. later that day i ask my mom and said, ""mom i need advice where should i work.""

She said, ""Generic_Name because its a great first job to have as a teenager."" Getting advice from more people is good because, It could bring more ideas that you didn't know about, it can help you to make the right decision, and it can help you because others could have experience from your problem.

My first topic is it can help you because it could bring new ideas about the advice you need. when i was asking Mom and Generic_Name where i should work they both gave me new ideas about Generic_Name. My mom said, ''that it's a great first job for a teenager.'' which it is because it shows me how to be responsible with my time learn how to save money and so much more. Generic_Name told me that they give benefits which i didn't know. So if i work there i get benefits like a little of my college payed for . Now i got 2 new ideas about working at Generic_Name i think i want to work there.

My second topic is it can help you with making the right decision. Like my friend Generic_Name need help because he wanted to ask this beautiful girl out but didn't know if he would get rejected or not. ''Generic_Name"", called Generic_Name i need your help i wanna ask Generic_Name out but i don't know if she likes me. Generic_Name said, ''dude she totally likes you i have seen her stare at you before and she keeps checking you out.'' Generic_Name said, ""Thank you.'' and walked off. Generic_Name later that day ask Generic_Name and said ''do you think Generic_Name like me or no."" Generic_Name said, ""she 100 percent likes you i have seen her look you up and down."" Generic_Name said ''thank you'' and walked away. Later that day he built up the courage to go ask her out. As Generic_Name was walking he's hands started sweating and he became nervous but he said, Generic_Name will you go out with me"" and she said yes. that why asking other people for advice can help you because if Generic_Name didn't ask Generic_Name or Generic_Name he wouldn't have asked out Generic_Name.

My final topic is that asking people for advice could help you because they might have experienced it before you did. I was running home from school and ran into my neighbors garden. i didn't know if i should tell them or not so i asked my sister and said, ""Generic_Name i ran into Mrs. Generic_Names garden should i tell her or no."" she said, ''i would tell because if she finds out you did it and you didn't tell her she going to be mad and i know she would because i ran into her garden too awhile ago and I didn't tell her and she found out and i got in more trouble."" So i walked up so scared that Mrs. Generic_Name was going to be so mad but she open the door and i told her that i ran into her garden and she was upset but happy i told her. that's why asking advice is good because other people might have done the same thing but did the wrong choice.

In conclusion i got the job, got my friend to date the girl he liked and didn't get in trouble with Mrs. Generic_Name because i asked people for advice. so that's why getting advice from other people is good because it could help with new ideas, it can help you make the right choice, and it can help you because other people might have experience it before.",0
"Some people ask only one person for advice, but when talking to multiple people it can give you more advice. i agree with this statement. Here are my reasoning's why people should get advice from more than one person.

First maybe they don't know how to handle the situation. I say this because asking more than one person can help you more on trying to find a way to handle the situation. Also getting advice from then one person is good because it gets less stress off your back and you are hearing what other people have to say.

Secondly talking to more people can give you more advice on what to do. If you just talk to one person it may not help but if you go to more that one person you can gather everyone s advice and see which one is best for you. Maybe the first person that gave you advice was good but the other people you didnt like there advice. From there you can gather everyone s thoughts and see whats best for you. And if you don't know something the best thing to do is ask someone. And if you aren't sure if you are making the right choice then keep asking until you get the right information.

Lastly maybe your just unsure. My reasoning behind this is when your involved in something and your unsure on what to do asking a group of people would be your best choice. This helps you with getting more ideas and help with something. Say i wanted a pet cat but i didnt know the bad things about cats. I could ask multiple people on advice about cats and that could help me so i could be sure i am making the right choice.

Those are my reasons why asking multiple people for advice is good. Because not being unsure or making bad choice isnt okay so its always good to more than one person for advice on what to do.",0
"Technology has revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with each other. From social media to instant messaging, we have countless ways to connect with people from all over the world. While technology has brought many benefits, it has also had a significant impact on interpersonal relationships. In this essay, I will discuss the negative effects of technology on interpersonal relationships.

One of the most significant negative effects of technology on interpersonal relationships is the loss of face-to-face communication. With the rise of social media and instant messaging, people are increasingly relying on digital communication to connect with others. While this can be convenient, it can also lead to a lack of personal interaction. When we communicate through screens, we miss out on the non-verbal cues that are so important in building and maintaining relationships. This can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and a lack of emotional connection.

Another negative effect of technology on interpersonal relationships is the loss of privacy. With the rise of social media, our personal lives are more accessible than ever before. Our friends, family, and even strangers can see our posts, photos, and updates. This can be uncomfortable and lead to a loss of privacy. It can also lead to cyberbullying, online harassment, and other negative online behaviors.

Finally, technology can also lead to a lack of empathy and understanding in interpersonal relationships. When we communicate through screens, we can become disconnected from the emotions and experiences of others. This can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding, which is essential for building and maintaining healthy relationships. It can also lead to a lack of emotional intelligence, which is important for effective communication and relationship building.

In conclusion, while technology has brought many benefits, it has also had a significant impact on interpersonal relationships. The loss of face-to-face communication, the loss of privacy, and the lack of empathy and understanding are just a few of the negative effects of technology on relationships. It is important for us to be aware of these effects and take steps to mitigate them. This can include limiting our screen time, being mindful of our online behavior, and prioritizing face-to-face communication in our relationships. By doing so, we can build and maintain healthy, meaningful relationships in the digital age.",1
"Dear Principal,

I believe that, it could be a good thing if you were to change the average to a B average, because for the kids that wan to play sport's would have to get there grades up, in order to play. For some of the kids, sports is there life and that's a big reason why they would try, and do good in school. So if you were to move the average up to B then they would try harder and not slack as much as they do. Also if you were to raise it up then the kids could get into a better college. The kids who have a C average are barley getting by, but only by enough to stay on the team, and to play the sport they wish to.

Kids would raise there grades, and they would try harder in school to stay on the team, or be able to play.

Like example for me, if i was on the high school soccer team, and i had only a C average, and i heard that they were changing it to wear you had to have a B average, and if you didn't have that then you couldn't play, and you might kicked of the team, then i would raise my grades i would try harder, try to get all my work done. I would do whatever i could to get my work done , and to raise my grade so i could keep playing on the soccer team .

If i couldn't play on a team because of my grade's, i would be embarrassed, if did, i wouldn't have any hope, because its like all your hopes are getting crushed. If i was going to get a scholarship to a college, and it was because of my grade's i didn't get in, i would be really mad. So i believe that it would be a good idea to raise the grade average up to B. There G.P.A would go up, there chances of getting into a college, or a better college would go up . Plus the kids would be able to go for sports . The way that i look at it is, if they want it that bad, and if they set there mind to it, they will do it. So if the student really wants to play a sport, but his grades are low he will make an effort to get them up.

That's why i believe that you as the principal should raise the average up to a B. The kids will put more effort into there work so they get the grade's they need and want . In the long run it will be better for them .",0
"In my opinion the use of Facisl Action Coding System is not valuable on a classroom because that is something dumb to do or have in a classroom.

A teacher can tell when a student is boring or when he is not paying attention the student might feel embarrased if he gets to take that test becuase, it will be in front of everyone, I think having that in a classroom will be useless but maybe for some students it will be cool getting their faces read by a computer program.

The story in paragraph 8 says ""faces don't lie"" and that is true we can fake a smile but not everyday, when we're tired we can't fake that we're not tired our eyes will be slow and we are not wide awake, when we're mad people easly notice it but what im trying to say is that having this technology to read the facial expressions of students in a classroom is really unessesary because our faces don't lie and it will be cool not going to lie but i don't really see the benefits of doing that, is worthless we wont be getting to know or learn from it but students will probably had fun with it and having fun is good in class beacause we get to take a break from school work.

"There are few people who can can imagine living a full life in this generation without these glorified metal boxes with wheels attached to them even fewer set living a life similar to that as a goal. The advantages of limiting the amount of cars being used are surprisingly unique due to the dwindling amount of disadvantages there are. Some of these advantages include reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and that there will be a reduction in smog. It is always nice to see humanity band together, willingly or forcefully, to work for a common good.

Let us begin with the most pressing issue: preserving the environment. Studies have shown that nearly ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" come from passenger cars Rosenthal 1, 5. Reducing these greenhouse gases, which pose a threat to the Earth's atmosphere, would be an improvement, although slow, still an improvement nonetheless. While this would not be the immediately noticeable of changes, making an effort to cleanse our cities of pollution would be.

Moving on, some places have taken this matter into their own hands, matters that some would describe as extreme. Paris, France is one of these examples, ""enforcing a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...motorists...ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine..."" Duffer, 1011.It is pleasant to see a city taking this matter into their own hands. This ban, though, did spark an uproar on the Internet, but it did die down. Many approaches to cleansing cityair have been drastic, but others such as in Columbia, had some sort of event where ""the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Selsky, 21. This did allow a public freedom, despite there still being a fine in place. The remarkable fact of this is that even though cars are being banned, a large portion of the targeted population actually do not mind the change, even ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating""Selsky, 23.

Suprisingly enough, this carban revolution is still going on today. Many more people are starting to realize the benefits to the ban. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in her article ""The End of Car Culture"" even adds in that many ""sociologists believe...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment...""34. This simply furthers the ideal that humanity as a whole CAN see a chance to change, wants to desperately do so, and WILL do so...eventually.",0
"When it comes to electives, the debate is divided between those who see them as a vital part of academic and personal growth, and those who view them as a mere distraction from the pursuit of knowledge. On one hand, electives expose students to a variety of subjects, allowing them to gain valuable skills and knowledge outside of their chosen major. Additionally, students can use electives to explore their interests, helping them to determine their future career path. On the other hand, some students find the range of elective offerings to be too limited or uninteresting, leading them to question why they even need to attend school at all. 

To evaluate the impact of elective classes, one must consider the academic and career opportunities available to students. For example, research has shown that taking an elective course in business can lead to better outcomes for students in finance-related careers. Additionally, taking an elective can help students to improve their academic performance by increasing their engagement with the material. Ultimately, it is incumbent upon educators to offer elective classes that are interesting and relevant to students, in order to ensure that every student has the opportunity to explore the subjects that interest them the most.",1
"Can you imagine living in a time zone where no one buys cars because they are no longer needed ? The world depend on nothing but technolgy. How would you spend your time? Although there are positive apsects to having a car that drives itself there are also negative aspects to this car. The cars can drive themselves but are unable to drive through traffic jams or raod work . Therefore I am against cars that drive themselves.

Even though the cars are smart enough to drive themselves they are not smart enough to drive on non-smart roads. In the late 1950s GM ,General Motors created a car that could run on a speacial track but the track was enbedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to the car. Therefore all roads would have to require upgrades and this is something that is too expensive. The passage says that the cars can't drive through traffic jams,road contruction and when the vehicle is around danger . So if the driver is not paying attention to the car , the road and others around it then how can the car ,the car would be unable to save itself from crashing. With this being said I believe driverless cars are dangerous and would be way to expensive.

As i said there are benefits to this driverless car , while the car drives it self it provides enteratinment such as sound but when it is time for the driver to take over it turns everything off. This is a great idea because it creates less distraction for the driver.

Imagine driving a driverless car and it shuts down in the middle of traffic ,there is a person driving behind does not notice you are having car troubles and hits you. Whose fault is this accident ? Whose going to pay for the damage?

I feel that there are more downfalls with this idea than great ideas .It is dangerous , too expensive , and takes as much energy and time as driving yourself around. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen .         ",0
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

This is a serious cause to many people but for some reason many of those students have a grade C average but you must have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. In this reasonable letter I will be supporting my argument with specific reasons. Feel welcome to not accept my reasonings but i assure you that it will be better to let C students be eligible for playing sports.

My number top one reason is that the school will lose popularity do to the fact that students will transfer out to another school in search of a school that accept C students in sports and other activities. The school will lose money but not that much but yeah they will have no more basketball games or any other sport that requires an entrance fee. So I really think that you should consider the policy before you make it official. Another reason to let these students get in sports is that a C is a passing criteria grade point average score. Another reason is that it will help the students out of gang and drug participation, instead they would be in school training or participating in a school activity.

So please TEACHER_NAME help the school by accepting C students into sports. It would save you a lot of F students and trouble with the school. You will also be helping out a family in accepting his/or her child into a free sport team instead of struggling to pay a out side of school team which would cost alot of cheddar. I hope this essay has changed your mind, good day to you sir and thank you for taking time to read this.",0
"In recent years, there has been a debate centered around whether imagination is more important than knowledge. Albert Einstein famously stated that ""imagination is more important than knowledge."" While it is certainly important to foster creativity and cultivate imagination, I believe that knowledge is actually more valuable, and should be given greater precedence. 

Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and information that has been learned through experience and study. It provides us with a base of facts from which we can draw conclusions and extrapolate information. Knowledge helps us make decisions and offers us a reliable foundation from which to build upon, while imagination is a tool which allows us to take what we already know and use it to create something entirely new.

An example of the differences between imagination and knowledge can be seen in the case of a scientist. Mistakenly believing that knowledge and imagination are mutually exclusive, some may think that a scientist's goal is simply to possess lots of knowledge. However, this is not the case, as a scientist's job is actually to use what they already know to come up with new ideas and solutions. In this way, imagination and knowledge are integrated and both used to further scientific research.

The importance of imagination and knowledge may be more balanced than what Albert Einstein initially implied. Knowledge serves as the foundation for creative ideas and imagination is the key that makes these ideas a reality. Together, knowledge and imagination have the ability to shape the world in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Ultimately, both imagination and knowledge are essential components for meaningful discovery and it is important to employ both in our day-to-day lives.",1
"I think Policy one is the right policy. Think about most people need to have there phones at school because maybe after school they need to call someone to pick them up. Or maybe they have no lunch money and they didn't bring a lunch so they need to call their parents to bring them one. I mean I've had to call my parents before during school to tell them I needed something. One time I forgot to bring my book to school and I left it at home. So I called my mom to bring to school for me and she did. So I got a hundred on bring my book to school that day. Think if something happened like the mom got a flat tire driving to school to pick them up. Then they would need a phone so they're parent could call them and tell them they needed to find a ride home. Think if the principle told them you couldn't have a phone at school. They could be sitting at school waiting for their mom to come get them but it never happens because they don't have a phone and the persons mom couldn't tell the kid she had a flat tire. Making a rule for a kid not to be able to have a phone at school would be outrageous. I also think it's a great plan to let the students be able to use their phones at lunch and dearing passing periods, not like it will effect anyone. Plus

I've seen kids go crazy at school because they forgot to bring it to school it's amazing. If really think taking kids phones away during school is going to help your living in a fantasy world. It's not the phones it are making grades go down it's because they make school no fun, so it's boring and no one wants to even be there. If people really want kids to have better test scores make school have more energy in it. No kid wants to learn in a boring environment. So yes policy one is ten times better then policy two. If they really want kids to get rid of their phones then make all the teachers including the principle get rid of her. Also make them only be able to office phone if it's an emergency. I know no teacher would go for that, so why do kids need to get rid of their phones.",0
"our school is made up of many school averages. When i heard that my principal was considering that b averages was the only way you could play a sport i was very surprised at the news. There are many reason why the principal shouldn't do this because many kids that's all they look forward to in school, they make get averment's with there sports, and they have great talents in there sport. Have you ever thought about it that way before?

first, many students think about getting out of school so they think about what they will do after, some students will text, watch tv,or what they would do a sport they love that makes them feel open and free and not have to worry about any of the small things that get to them like school,drama,and problems at home. i think ever students should be able to have the opportunely to be free and open in ever little thing they do wirthery they have a B average to.

many kids that i see make great averment's in there sports. they sportsman ship awards,fca awards they can get chiocoin to be the team captain those things change people in many ways so they could be like i am not doing so hot in school maybe i should care more about my school work and my sports. Their coach's influences them in many ways to the try for there goals in life and they want them to be a good player and a good academies student as well.

many students that i seee have get talnet in vereything they do i dot think that she school should be able in anyway to do that because if that was the case most all the students at my school wouldn't be in the sport. alot of talnet was natural and comes naturely so the school admester will never evre have the otherity to take that away from anyone.

so i hope next time the principal ever thinks about doing thid i hope they sit and think abiut the out come of there time and school.",0
"In recent times, many schools have started to offer distance learning for students. Parents have voiced their opinions on the benefits and the detriments of online school. However, Students would benefit from taking online courses or video conference classes because students that may be considered unpopular may not fit into the learning environment, students may have no means of transportation to the school, and students with certain mental disabilities, physical disabilities, or medical conditions may not be able to function independently in a public school setting.

Distance learning for some students would be beneficial to their grades, mental health, and other inconveniences that come along with attending a public school. For example, my friend's brother Generic_Name was bullied all throughout elementary school and middle school and was considered an outcast by his peers. Due to this, he was always on edge while in school, causing him to fall behind in his classes. When he learned of the opportunity to complete his high school education from home, he applied immediately. Because he switched to online school, Generic_Name received better grades and was overall the happiest he had even been. Another example is my cousin Generic_Name. While in school, Generic_Name was constantly stressed by the pressure she felt to succeed placed on her by her parents, teachers, and fellow classmates. As a result, she could not focus on her studies and received disappointing grades on her report cards. Her parents learned of her situation and decided to let Generic_Name try online courses. Unknowingly, this was a great decision and my cousin felt more relaxed and got straight A's on the following report card.

For some students, getting to school on time every morning is a challenge. My best friend Generic_Name lived miles away from the nearest school and his parents had no way to take him to school and the buses did not come out as far as his residence. Therefore, he had no way to school, but if he was able to take online courses he would not have to worry about getting to school everyday. Another friend of mine, Generic_Name, lived on a secluded farm with his parents and lived too far for the buses, as well. In addition, he had to wake up very early in the morning to aid his parents with the livestock. In both cases, online courses would have been the best option and could become standard for those living far away from schools.

A video conference or online course experience would most likely be the best option for students with disabilities. As an example, a child with cancer would most likely have to be taken out of school in order to recover. However, they are missing vital information while out of school. Furthermore, children in the hospital most likely want to have the comfort of a relatively normal life. Online education would be a beneficiary to the child so it can still gain its education in recovery. Another example could be a child with cerebral palsy. Due to the child's condition, it may be hard for him of her to move around easily, so a large public school would definitely not be the greatest option for that student.

In conclusion, distance learning may not be the greatest option for the majority of students, but it would be a great option for certain students. Online school is a solution to any problem that might arise from having to attend public school, and could mean the success of a struggling students' endeavors.",0
"My Mother once said ""When you don't know what to do you can ask many people you trust for advice."". Asking for advice is a great way to get help from people. When asking for advice asking multiple people is good for more ideas, better opinions, and a better approach.

When asking for advice you can find out more ideas. More ideas can help business wise. With more ideas businesses can find out more ways to expand. More ideas are good for planning. If you're planning a family trip you can more ideas on where to go. More ideas can help with handling situations. You can ask people on how to better handle a situation. With more ideas you can better form opinions.

Asking for advice is like asking for better opinions. With better opinions you can help someones love life. When a friend is dealing with a heart break you can give them opinions on what they should do. With better opinions you can help run a business. If you're a worker you can give your opinions on why you should get a raise. When at school you might want the school rules to change. You can tell the principle your opinions and what should change and, he might take what you said into consideration. With better opinions you can have a better approach.

With more ideas and, better opinions your approach can be better. You can ask your teacher for advice. When asking your teacher for advice you can better your schooling. You can ask your family members for advice. Asking your family for advice can help you in many ways like your personal problems, schooling, or bullying. Asking your friends for advice is great help too. Asking your friends for advice is goof for when your sad or need help in general. When asking for advice you get a better approach from a lot of people.

Advice can come from anyone and the more people you ask the better. Asking for advice is a great way to get more ideas, better opinions, and a better approach. When asking for opinions who might you ask to help?",0
"Dear principal

I think you should consider with the decision of students doing extra-curricular activities because, i feel that students should be able to enjoy the activities but also be able to learn in a fun and easy way.

If i was to do an extra-curricular activity it would probably be a program were people will be able to do hands-on activities and be wiling to work with different and other types of people ( you should do different activities and learn the things you do in a better way.)

(""Students should participate in at least one or more activities"".)

Why: because we should be doing things we like to do. And also it may help those who need time to relieve stress from school and at home.

I agree with the principals say so in making use do extra curricular activities! because students are not very active because we have to deal with school work,chores but mainly so that students could stay out of trouble inside and outside of school.

So if you were to decide and let us do extra-curricular activities you would be pleased by the way students improve from now to how they use to act in the past.        ",0
"The Seagoing Cowboys program was a life-changing experience for me. I got to see so many different places and have adventures that I never thought I would have. I'm not the only one who feels this way, lots of other cowboys have had similar experiences.

Firstly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to see the world. I got to visit places like Hawaii, Japan, and Korea. I even got to go to Russia! Can you believe it? Russia! I never thought I would be able to visit a place like that. And let me tell you, it was amazing. The culture, the food, the people, everything was so different from what I'm used to. It was a real eye-opener.

Secondly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to learn new skills. I learned how to ride horses, how to take care of them, and how to handle all sorts of situations. I even learned how to speak some Russian! It was really helpful when we were in port and I could talk to the locals. It made me feel like I was really connecting with them.

Thirdly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to make new friends. I met so many other cowboys who were just like me, passionate about horses and adventure. We became like a family, looking out for each other and supporting each other through the ups and downs.

Lastly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to challenge yourself. It's not always easy, there are long days and hard work, but it's worth it. You'll learn so much about yourself and what you're capable of. I never thought I could handle some of the things I had to do, but I did it. And you can too.

In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys program is an amazing opportunity. It's a chance to see the world, learn new skills, make new friends, and challenge yourself. I'm so glad I did it and I think you should too. So, saddle up and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime!",1
"Every four years america as a whole chooses on who should be the president of the united states. The process of election is straight forward and always follows the same process every election. The american citizens vote on one of the two candidates, then those votes are counted and giving to the electors, then the electors of each state representing the population of said state including the District of Columbia votes one of the candidates, after all votes are tallied the winning candidate is elected president. Overall this system seems rather complicated and can be seen as an unfair process at which only to vote on who takes charge of america. The electoral college should be replaced by who receives the most popular votes from all american citizens and not the state electoral.

Electoral college is a process created during the founding of the united states as sort of a ""middleground"" or compromise on how the people of the country should elect the president . In order for a president to be elected out of the 538 electors that make up the electoral college he or she must at least receive 270 votes . Each president has a group of electors that process your votes in order to choose who the state votes for making it in a ways unfair. This system can come with its own set of problems that include replacement of electors, electors voting to who they feel, and at times one candidate gaining the most popular vote but losing the chance of presidency because of the lack of electoral votes form the state . An example of the unbalanced power is the near success of the louisiana legislature replacing the democratic electors in the 1960, segregation with new ones that would oppose against John F. Kennedy making him lose the popular vote.

The best replacement for the electoral college is to allow the citizens of america to vote upon who should be the president of the U.S without the need for electors. The candidate that receives the most votes is the one who becomes the president of the united states. In order to process all possible millions of votes into a rational percentage and the candidate with the higher percentage would in turn become president. With this in mind the candidates would need to visit all or largely selected states in order to deliver campaign speeches to persuade the population to vote for them, because with the electoral college system candidates would focus mainly on tight races in the ""swing states"" practically ignoring other like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see their candidate . The electoral college only focuses on the large numbers and not on the smaller population that can still make a difference making the system unfair. Making them only focus on the big states because how many electoral votes it could bring compared to a smaller state which could possibly only supply three.

On the other side electoral college does have a good standing as a method of vote. Electoral college has five good reasons on why it shouldn't be replaced and they are certainty of outcom, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and avoid runoff elections . Each campaign party chooses their electors which rarely end in betrayel making it possible to win the election with low popularity votes. The electoral system also gives the candidate a chance to win in a ""landslide"" because of the winnertakeall basis at which it follows . No region has enough votes to elect a president also the electoral college needs to have transregional appeal. And the main goal of the electoral college is to obviously elect a new president but as well avoid runoff elections.

The electoral college is an unfair system of voting because of how it all depends on a small group of selected representatives and not all of the american population as a whole. Even though it can be regarded as a fair middle ground it still has its flaws and doesnt reach out to society as a whole only focusing on the states that can lead to victory, casting out those who's electoral votes will not make much of a difference. In the end the voting system should mainly focus on popularity of a candidate than what the ""state"" feels they should vote for because of how many votes they actually received for a given candidate due to the fact that it may end up voting on which who they feel and refuse to vote for their partys candidate. The electoral system should be replaced.",0
"My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. In my opinion this is a great idea. This requirement will hopefully increase the amount of learning opportunities, through educational extracurricular activities. Exercise, through physical or sport related extracurricular activities. Or even this one extracurricular activity will improve a students social skills, through team building or just working with other people on something in hopes that they make new friends. I believe that the student requirement to have at least one extracurricular activity is a good implement because it can provide extra learning opportunities, increase physical fitness, and improve student social skills.

I believe that being required to do an extracurricular activity will provide more learning opportunities. One way that doing an extracurricular activity will provide more learning opportunities is where you have school sponsored, after school activities made to help you in school or in specific subjects. One example of an extracurricular activity is the ""Homework club"". The ""Homework club"" is an after school extracurricular activity created to help you with subjects you are struggling in, assignments you dont quite understand, or school work that you are unable to do at home. This educational club comes with free tutors and teachers that will hopefully be able to answer any question you have and help you with any assignments you need assistance on.

I believe that being required to do an extracurricular activity will increase physical fitness.

One example of a extracurricular activity based around physical activity is ""Weight room"". ""Weight room"" is an after school extracurricular activity based around physical movement and fitness. This club meets up after school to use the Robinson weight room. The weight room is a smaller gym based around work out equipment. Some of this equipment includes ,stationary bikes, stair climbers, rowing machines, basic weights, bars, and dumbbells ranging in weight. The people in this extracurricular club prosper to increase their physical fitness and become healthier.

I believe that being required to do an extracurricular activity will improve a students social skills. There are numourus extracurricular clubs that dont base around education and fitness and these clubs, I would say improve a students social skills. One example of this is the after school tech theater club. This club comes together for about a month to help with the technical side of a Rambunctious theater show. In this club you get to meet new people and are able to help out your department. There are many departments in this club ranging from sound technician to costume and makeup technician. To join this club you have to submit an application and select what department you would like to be in for the production. This department requires team work with your other technicians and I think that this club is a good way to make new friends and teach better social skills.

In conclusion If the principal were to implement this requirement at my school it would be beneficial. These extracurricular activities would greatly improve it's student's, individually but it would also improve the entire school as a whole. Through these activities you will find a way to become more healthy and fit. You will have access to more learning opportunities and I believe that you will even find yourself making new friends through these clubs or sports you find yourself doing. If the requirement to do one extracurricular activity was implemented I would not oppose because I know that it can provide extra learning opportunities, increase physical fitness, and improve student social skills.                                  ",0
"Everyday, students enjoy themselves and learn new skills while interacting with their classmates. Not only is school a place to learn, the classrooms hold many children of the same ages who get the chance to communicate and discover new things about each other. Putting children in school is one of the most beneficial decisions a parent can make. Although many people believe distance learning from home is the most helpful way of learning because it better fits the busy schedules of children, learning in school is much more beneficial because children get the opportunity to learn and interact with others, students will not become dependent on technology, and kids will adapt to necessary time management skills.

To begin with, school may not be the most exciting time of the day, but it teaches many life skills used regularly. In the classrooms, students work together in teams to complete tasks and share ideas. Whether somebody is working in a job or purchasing something from the store, these necessary interaction skills are all taught in the early years of school. For example, if somebody completed their schooling online and was ready to go off to college, they would have a tough time getting around due to the fact that they have had no prior communication with other students. Completing school inside the classroom relieves stress from students who might be struggling on something while working alone online. Students who take advantage of learning in class together will learn important interaction and communication skills.

In addition, technology is increasingly becoming a part of everyday life for people all over the world. Children everywhere are being influenced by their screen, preventing them from focusing on the task at hand. In order for kids to stay kids, they must physically stay in school and not take online courses from home. While many kids are becoming well rounded and physically active with each other, some children are stuck at home taking online school through their computers. For example, the children in school will learn to do things on their own using their heads without having to rely on technology. Students who only interact with people through their screens will become more and more dependent on technology which can cause many problems down the road.

Last but not least, time management is one of the most important skills for people to have no matter what age they might be. The whole world is running on a strict schedule every hour of the day. When students attend classes in school, they get up on time, get themselves ready, and learn how to balance their busy schedules. Learning how to manage time at a young age is no easy task; however, students can master their skills by physically taking classes in school and preparing for life ahead. Children who take online school courses will struggle in the future to balance their time and live a life full of stress.

In conclusion, learning in school is much more beneficial for children because they get the chance to interact and communicate with others, they will not become reliant on technology alone, and they will learn necessary time management skills to be used everyday. When every child is enrolled into their school for class, they will be ready for the future and prepared for anything that life might throw their way. On the other hand, if children remain in online courses, they will struggle communicating with other people throughout their entire lives. Every student should be physically put into school to ensure a great future at this very moment.",0
"Hey there!  So, I guess you wanna know about the diff between bein' successful and bein' a failure, huh? Like, which one is better? 🤔

Well, let me tell ya, both have their pros and cons. See, bein' successful means you're doin' good in life, you got your stuff together, and you're reachin' your goals. People might call you a go-getter, a achiever, or even a superstar! 😎 But, on the other hand, bein' a failure means you're not doin' so great, you might be strugglefin' to make ends meet, and people might think you're not as cool as the successful people. 🙄

Now, how do you prevent yourself from failin'?  Well, it's kinda hard, but you gotta stay focused, work hard, and never give up! You gotta set them goals and work towards 'em, even when it gets tough. And don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it! 

But, here's the thing, sometimes even if you do all that and you still fail, it's okay!  Yeah, I know, it's hard to believe, but it's true! Cuz sometimes, failin' can be a good thing too! It means you're takin' risks, tryin' new things, and learnin' from your mistakes!  And who knows, maybe that failure will lead to somethin' even better! 🤔

And, on the other hand, if you're always successful, it can be...  well, it can be kinda boring!  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's great to achieve your goals and all, but if you're always doin' the same thing and never takin' risks, you might miss out on some amazin' opportunities! 

So, in conclusion, bein' successful and bein' a failure are both important in their own ways. It's all about",1
"What exactly is the facial action coding system? Well it enables computers to identify human emotions and expressions. This is an interesting way to understand a indivuals emotional expressions. Children in this mordern day have a tendency of hiding some deep emotions and expressional feelings from their peers,friends,and family. Being able to figure out some of their emotions could save a lot of problems long term.

The worst thing a person can do is hide their emotions from people. This can really lead to a bad depression or other sad emotional syndromes. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it stated that ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, etc."" This shows that a person understanding someone emotions is very diffucult. People can hide their feelings really well especially students when even they are having their worst day.

Facial action coding system can really help adults to understand the true emotions of a student. The story says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insturctor."" This by far is an excellent idea. In the US in today's world a lot of students homework is online. Not even just homework at school but in everyday life it has something to do with technology.

By being said the students that can't comprehend the lesson, there can be an alternative assignment that they can to so at least they are learning something. Doing something that you kind of know and bettering yourself at that is way more benefical then doing something you have no knowledge of. A lot of students don't ask for help when they are struggling with a assignment. Most of the time they either skip it or copy down answer without getting the full structure of the material. If the students are not understanding something in a lesson the material is only going to get way harder for them without any help.

In the end, the facial coding system is a great creation and will be very benefical toward students. Teachers a very educated and have the Knowledge to help the students. If they don't know who is struggling though at all times they can't help every student.                                                   ",0
"Half or more humans use there technology for social media instead talking to them in person. Most websites on the Internet shows that humans that keeps using there technology for along time goes through out depression. We should stop using technology for fun. It could help humans have a battler life, also you could protect your eyes form getting glasses. One of my best friend had glasses wend he was only 5 year old. He was watching TV in front of the screen

Technology can help us in a way like sending pictures to someone that live far away form you, Doing your homework. Finding out the time and also the mind reason of technology is calling your family members and also you friends that live in a different country. But technology cost a lot of money. But my option is that technology does not helps you on any thing. Technology just routines you brain cell.

Technology can also make a dumb guy. Like if you keep using you phone and not study for a quiz or a test you going to get a bad grade for it. This is why technology bad for everyone. If If you use technology if going to eat your brain cell. One of my friend cheated on a test with his phone come on, the teacher was just seating on his chair and playing on his phone.

"Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about Thomas Jefferson and how he thought about work. Like, he was a big deal back in the day and stuff, and he had some pretty cool ideas about how to be successful. So, he believed that hard work is super important for achieving success. He thought that if you just sit around and do nothing, you're never gonna get anywhere. But, he also thought that technological advancements can be a good thing because they can help you get things done faster and easier. Like, imagine if we didn't have computers or smartphones, we'd have to do everything by hand, which would take forever!

But, he also thought that sometimes people can use technology as an excuse to not work hard. Like, if we rely too much on technology, we might not have to put in as much effort, and that's not cool. He believed that staying motivated and working hard is what really matters. He thought that if you want to achieve success, you have to be willing to put in the effort and not take shortcuts.

So, I think he's right. Like, I know some people who are really successful, and they're not just lucky, they work hard for it. They're always motivated and pushing themselves to do better. And, I think if I want to be successful too, I need to be like that too. I can't just rely on technology to do everything for me. I need to put in the effort and work hard if I want to achieve my goals.

For example, there's this one kid in my class who's really smart and always gets good grades. He never complains or makes excuses, he just works hard and does his best. And, he's always motivated and focused, even when things get tough. I think he's a good example of someone who understands what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson thought that hard work is super important for success, and I think he's right. While technology can be helpful, it can also be an excuse for inactivity. We need to find a balance between using technology to make things easier and working hard to achieve our goals. So, let's all try to be more like that kid in my class",1
"Hey there! 👋 As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to tackle this essay prompt on the use of cell phones in the classroom. 📱📚

So, here's the thing: I know some people think that having cell phones in class is super distracting and it takes away from learning. But, I think it's actually pretty cool! 😎 Like, think about it: we can use our phones to look up stuff, take notes, and even use apps that help us learn new things! 📚💡

But, I know some people might be worried that too much screen time can be bad for us. Like, it can make us sit around all day and not move around enough. 😴 And, it can also be distracting if we're not using it for learning stuff. 😖

So, I did some research to see if there's a correlation between screen time and academic performance. And, guess what? 🤔 It turns out that there is! 🎉 Studies show that when we use our phones for learning, we do better in school! 📚🎓

But, here's the thing: it's not just about using our phones for learning. It's about how we use them. 🤔 Like, if we're just scrolling through social media all day, that's not gonna help us learn anything. 🙅‍♂️ But, if we use our phones to look up stuff, take notes, and even use apps that help us learn new things, that's when we see the benefits! 📚💡

So, here are some potential solutions to make the use of cell phones in the classroom more effective: 🔍

1. Set limits: Let's set limits on how much screen time we get during class. That way, we can use our phones for learning without getting distracted. 📱🕒
2. Use educational apps: Let's use apps that are actually helpful for learning! 📚",1
"Why Students Should do a Extra Curricular Activity

Have you ever been stressed and need something to clear your mind? That is why students should be required to do at least one extra curricular activity. Extra curricular activities is a great opportunity that every kid should be required to do because it lets you take your mind of of school and do something that you enjoy with your friends.

Extra curricular activities are a great way to meet new people and practice life skills. I moved to a school this year and I new very few people, but then I joined a extra curricular activity and I met a lot of people. This also means that people from a grade can still hang out with someone from a different grade level. Meeting people gives you great life skills because you learn how to greet people and you learn how to be more social and less shy. This means that people meet a lot of new people and they learn a lot about each other. You also learn their points of view. You learn a lot of different perspectives on how to fix certain problems that our would is facing. With all of those points of views, you can learn the best ways to fix the problems. Some people may say that you can do that outside of an extra curricular activity, but that is wrong because if you go to the grocery store you would not stop every one that is going down the isle and talk to them for 30 minutes. If you were a part of an extra curricular activity, you would have the chance to talk longer because you are with them after school for a long time.

Extra curricular activities are also a great way to do something that you enjoy. I joined a extra curricular activity and I am always exited to go there after school and have fun. I love doing it and I would not be able to do it at home. This means that I have a lot of fun doing what I love with new friends that I can hang out with. It also lets you not stress over school and think about something happy and exiting. Some people may say that anything you do at the school you can do at home, but that is not true because some people that go to the public schools can not afford it and even If you did, you would still need to bring people to your house to play it. If you did bring people over to do that it would be the same thing as having it at you school, but worse because it is less convenient and the school pays for the equipment. If you did it at your house you would have to pay. Some parents can not even pick their kids up until a little later so it gives them something fun to do. That is why it is a great way to do something that you enjoy.

Extra curricular activities should also be enforced because it lets people try new things that they may not be able to do at home. It is always good to try new things because you do not know if you like it. You may be really good at it, but you never know until you try. If you hate that extra curricular activity than their are a lot more and I am sure that you will find some that you really love and enjoy. This means that you find something you love and can connect to other people that love that activity as well. Some people may say that you can connect with people that do not do an extra curricular activity, but that is not true because it would be very hard to ask a lot of people what they love to do outside of school. If you do an extra curricular activity, it would be a lot easier to connect and you may end up being great friends at school and maybe even in the future. It is a lot easier to make connections and get to know each other if you spend a lot of time together.

Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities. Extra curricular activities lets kids try new things that they may love. Extra curricular activities also lets you meet new people. Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities. Extra curricular activities lets you take your mind of off school and it lets you hang out with friends. ",0
"In the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars'' it shows enough evidence for the face to be another landform. In the next three paragraphs i will be telling you why the face is just another landform.

In history there have been many conspiracys about alot of things that have turned up to be nothing horrific or amazing. The scientist actually thought it was just another landform. As explained in paragraph twelve,''What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American west.''The article also says that the Snake River of Idaho can take the form of a isolated messa about the size of the Face on Mars. This paragraph surely by itself can tell people why the Face on Mars was just a landform.

In paragraph three it says ''it was a huge rock formation which resembales a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of a mouth,nose and ears. In paragraph eleven you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyrimids or even small shacks you could see what they were. Most people think aliens are not real. Now that scientist have better picture takers compared to the viking one and two.

The main reason i do not want you to believe that the Face on Mars ia a alien artifact is because the the article gives you the best reanson not to. In paragraph seven it says,''when Mars Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time Micheal Malin and his Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

I hope this argumentative essay will chang your mind about whether or not you believe that the Face on Mars was a landfom and not a alien artifact. Giving that you read this essay i think my three body paragraphs will do more than influence your posistion on the subject.

My principal has decided for all students would have to participate in one extrarricular activity. Say for example the student would have to go outside in have to play sport's. But they would go over the rules for every sport that they have out to play with. In for the year books you would be able to learn how to spell word's that you never new how to spell. The student's would also get a feel of how other student's our in they might even make a new freind's.

I agree because I think student's do not get enough exercise. If student's got enough exercise it would be more athleyt's. It would be more student's outside playing all types of sport's. They would be able to breath better than other poeple that do not like to exercise. In if student's do not get enough exercise they would not be able to leave a nice long life.

I think it is good for student's to exercise if all student's exercise they would leave a long healthy life. In if you leave a long life you be able to see the world in travel. But if you do not want to take care of your body you would not leave a long nice life. Like for example you would have to go threw alot to try to leave a healthy life. But if you do you would be able to complete your life long dream.

For the year books you would have to type poeple names. In the rason I think that is good is because the student's can get to laern new student's. The student's that our working on the year books can learn how too spell word's that they never even seen before. But you never know the student's can think the person that they saw in the year book is cool in want to be there freind.

So if i was you i would start exercising early so I can be haelty when im older. My princeipal has decided for all student's would have to participate in one extrourrieular activity. In if you do not participate in one of the extourrielur activity you would get in big trouble with the princeipal. I do agree for these so student's would start getting in shape in really healthy.",0
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to guarantee that students will continue to learn during their summer break. It is essential that students keep learning even though they are taking a break from school, but these summer projects should be teacher-designed. Why should a students not be allowed to choose a project of their liking? Well, the student's teacher will know what that person needs to work on. If a student were to choose what they would like their project to be about, they could probably decide to work on something that does not require much effort; therefore, it would be best if a professional particularly assigned a certain topic to help his or her pupil designated to help them grow and become more efficient in their academic life. However, if the student believes that there is a specific topic they believe they need to practice more than the teacher should consider to make an exemption.

Students would certainly benefit if they were given homework over summer. This action would ensure that the student will be ready to tackle classroom assignments once they are back to school. Not only that but it would also let the student perfect their skills and be prepared in class. These projects designated to students will surely boost the alumni's knowledge and confidence on that specific topic. Therefore, the student will not struggle as much as they would have without the extra help.

In addition, if teachers assign students particular homework designed to help their alumni be more efficient in class, it is undeniable that their student's classroom performance will have a positive effect in their academic life. The teacher ,being a professional, will have more understanding of what their student needs to work on. He or she can personalize the project to better help the student understand and learn about their assignment. The extra help given to the alumni will have positive results and they could use their knowledge acquired by the project on other classes, or these young adults can use this information outside of school to help them handle outside of school life situations. If trained professionals give students homework during summer break, then those students will be able to see how this extra work helped them master skills when school opens again.

Students should not be given the privilege to choose their own project assignments. Some students would pick easy topics that would not require them to put much effort, this will deeply harm the student academically. Instead of working hard to perfect an area in which the student struggles, they would rather choose something that is easy and would get done quickly. This is why it is better if teachers gave students their assignments. However, it can not be guaranteed that the students will learn or understand the homework assignment. For that reason could be that maybe the student is not ready to take on that particular topic. Without a doubt, it is known that not all students learn the same way and not all understand what they have learned. Everybody learns at their own pace and in their own way. If the student believes that the designated work is too hard, or maybe too easy, then they should talk to their teacher and suggest a different topic. Also, if the students thinks that there is another area they need to practice more, they should ask their teacher to consider their request.

Schools that require students to continue learning during the summer will see positive results in students academic lives. Designated work from teachers will greatly help alumni master and perfect classroom skills. Not to mention, students will acquire more knowledge on these areas with the extra help that was provided. If the teacher knows what their students need to work more on, those students will soon be ready to take on anything once school is in cession again. If students were given the liberty to pick their projects, would the students actually learn from it? What happens if the student chooses an easy project, when they could have been working on some other topic that they know they have trouble with? This will certainly not be a good idea. As professionals, teachers know what is best for their students if they have been observing their classroom performance. However, Many teachers sometimes overlook a few things in which student have trouble with. When this happens the student should take a step forward and let their teacher know what it is they think they need to work. This way the teacher can look back and verify is this person does need to practice more in the areas that they may be struggling.",0
"How does asking for someone else advice helps you feel better? Generic_Name always said ""Asking for someone else opinion makes you come up with a better answer for your questions."" If I have the chance to ask for someone opinion I feel like it will make me feel much better knowing what is someone else prospective about.

One reason that asking for someone else advice benefits you is making the correct choice. Also it helps you understand what is others point of view by asking for their opinion.

Another reason is sometimes asking for someone opinion is much better. When someone ask you to give them an advice about the same topic you can combine your opinion with someone else to give her/she a great helpful advice.

Final reason is there are many ways asking for someone opinion benefits you. For example asking question you don't understand or asking them what you can do to understand. Where can you find information that will help you answer all the questions you got.

In conclusion someone else advice can help sometimes be successful in life. Also asking for someone advice can help you a lot in the way you think.      ",0
"In "" The Chellenge of Exploring Venus"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a wrthy persuit despite the dangers. Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase humans curiosity likely led us into many equally intimidating eneavors

One hink tha the author suggests that stufying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dengers it presents, is that many mission was unmannned and for good reason, since not spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

Another reason that the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers, is that. Aa thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more Challengingare the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 greater that what we experience on our own planet.

In conclusion studying Venus is dangerous, because the weather is too much for us; there are temperatures that our body can't support or recist. Also Venus is not touched down in more than three decades, so that can be very dngerous for humans to experiment Venus.",0
"I agree with Author Emerson because people can do what they think makes them happy, they will support what they believe in without fearing anything, and they will speak up for themselves. Emerson's quote is saying that we live in a world with many influences trying to change who you are , so to retain your individuality or who you are is a great magnanimous feature. Most people end up striving to change themselves to fit standards to portrayed by media or to try to impress someone, however I think that people who choose not to change, and to be themselves are the accomplished ones. Other people will be inspired to become like you if you exceed to be yourself and not care what others think of you , and you should do what makes you comfortable. By you going against what everyone thinks is normal , you are showing that you are happy about who you are and you will stand out , out of all the other people trying to be someone they are not. I know some people might disagree with me,but thats ok everyone has their own opinion.",0
"Have you ever thought that it would be the same being different planet as it is on Earth? It is not. Venus is the closest planet to Earth and people can not land on its surface for long because it is very different, as in the way it orbits the sun or how the clouds are corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is so close to earth and share similar traits with each other, the author wants this challenge to be conquered, and for the experience to be a learning insight.

First, the author states that Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because of their close proximity, density and size. This is a way that the author supports the idea because it should be a way that humans can reach this planet and study it. Also, because Venus is thought to be the most Earth like planet in the solar system. Ideas should be created in order to reach the limits of Venus.

Then, the author supports the idea with the statistic of how spaceships has not been able to touch Venus in more than three decades. As said in the article, ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?""(paragraph 4) If the challenge can be conquered of landing on Venus safely, Astronomers can gather so much insight that could also lead to other big things being conquered.

Lastly, the author supports the idea with the knowledge that can be gained from the experience. There has already been an idea of how humans will get to Venus, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.""(paragraph 5). With all the compelling ideas just to get to Venus is inspiring, like bringing back mechanical computers from World War II to gather the samples off of the surface to test. The pursuit of getting to Venus is full of new innovations, old improved innovations, and imagination.

In conclusion, the author's idea is very well supported with statistics and ambition. One day someone will make it to Venus and the results will hopefully be insightful and rewarding. Beyond what is on Earth should not be given up on or intimidating, instead it should be charged with great intentions.",0
"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.",0

"As an 8th grader, I believe that having career guides in high school is incredibly important. Research has shown that students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to pursue their dream careers. Without career guides, students may struggle to understand their options and may end up in a career that they are not passionate about.

One of the main benefits of having career guides in high school is that they help students understand their options. Career guides provide information on different careers, including job duties, salary ranges, and educational requirements. This information can help students make informed decisions about their future and can help them identify potential career paths that they may not have considered before. Additionally, career guides can help students understand the skills and qualifications needed for different careers, which can help them prepare for their future.

Students without access to career guides may struggle to understand their options and may feel lost when it comes to choosing a career. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in school, as students may feel like they are not being prepared for their future. On the other hand, students who have access to career guides are more likely to feel excited about coming to school and are more likely to be motivated to learn.

To give students the opportunity to pursue the careers they want, schools can provide access to career guides, career counseling, and work-based learning experiences. This can include internships, job shadowing, and other hands-on learning experiences that allow students to gain real-world experience in their chosen career. By providing these opportunities, schools can help students gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen career.

Career guides can also help students feel excited to come to school by providing them with information on potential career paths that they may not have considered before. By exposing students to different careers, career guides can help them find something that they are passionate about and that they want to pursue. This can lead to a more engaged and motivated student body, which can have a positive impact on the entire school.

There are also examples of people who have limited access to career guides. For example, students from low-income families may not have access to the same resources as their peers",1
"Title: The Power of Imagination and Knowledge in Achieving Success

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I've learned that having a good imagination and knowledge are super important in achieving our goals. Without them, we might miss out on some amazing opportunities. In this essay, I'll explain why imagination and knowledge are crucial, and how they can help us reach our dreams.

Imagination is like a magic wand that lets us dream big. It allows us to visualize things that don't exist yet, and come up with new ideas that can change the world. Without imagination, we wouldn't have things like technology, art, or even science. It's the spark that ignites creativity and innovation. But, it's not just about dreaming big, it's also about problem-solving. Imagination helps us think outside the box and come up with solutions to complex problems.

Knowledge, on the other hand, is like a map that guides us towards our goals. It's the foundation upon which our dreams are built. Without knowledge, we wouldn't know how to turn our ideas into reality. It's the key to unlocking our potential and achieving success. Knowledge helps us understand the world around us, and how to navigate it. It's what sets us apart from others and makes us stand out.

But, achieving our goals requires more than just imagination and knowledge. It takes effort! Effort is like the gas that powers our imagination and knowledge. Without it, we wouldn't be able to turn our ideas into reality. It's the fuel that keeps us going, even when things get tough. Effort is what separates the dreamers from the doers.

Now, let me give you an example of how imagination and knowledge can come together to help us achieve our goals. Let's say you want to apply for your dream job. You've always been fascinated by space exploration, and you want to work for NASA. You use your imagination to visualize yourself working on a space mission, and you spend countless hours researching and learning everything you can about space travel. You imagine yourself solving complex problems and overcoming obstacles, and you use your knowledge to come up",1
"In life people sometimes talk to multiple people when looking for advice. I believe that for many reasons we generally ask more than one person for advice, one person may be biased, not everyone can give correct advice, and they want someone to give advice that share there believes.

The first reason is that people can be biased. Biased people could be your friend, or a parent, and they don't mean to give really advice that doesn't work, but sometimes they just do. A counselor who isn't in your daily life all the time would be less biased and could be a fabulous second option if the first advice was too biased. It is just a good habit to stay away from biased people when looking for advice because nobody needs advise coming from somebody who may just be confused about what the question was. Or they could also purposely give you bad advice so you have to make sure to check that your advice is not biased so you don't take that advice the wrong way and so something stupid or that's not like you.

Another reason is that not everyone can give correct advice. If you ask someone who fought in world war two about stuff it would probably be the wrong type of advice since they were just in a war and are not in the mindset of our current generation. Someone who is way older than you and fought in a war might not be the choice for advice in these modern days. But a kinder gardener would not be good either, because they are too young and it wouldn't be the right advice because they would be in a younger generation mindset than us. So you sometimes have to talk to multiple people so you don't get advice that doesn't work for you.

The finial reason is that sometimes people need advice from people that share there believes. One example is if a Republican asks a Democratic for advice. Or if someone has a different religion than you and you still ask them for advice. You probably will get some advice that works, but depending on if your topic is more controversial on what you need advice about you can get advice that isn't right for you. So generally you should ask someone who you share believes with. If you just let the person give you advice and you follow that advice you got people might suspect something since it might not be the way you usually act.

In conclusion I believe that people talk to multiple people for advice because, people share different believes, one individual may be biased, and not everyone can give correct advice. During life people generally need advice and when they get advice they usually don't just ask one person for the advice they need.",0
"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids run-off elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.

Voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.

Run-off elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The run-off election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Many argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.                       ",0

Dear=principal

I know principal you're deciding whether to force students or require them to do community service. If I were you dear principal I would require every student to at least do 30 to 60 minutes of community service. I know that's not a lot but we can take to much time of students due to that some students need time to do class work(homework)and prepare for the next day and time for resting. But it does not mean they cant help the community for just a bit.

This idea can help our community improve by the following: If we collect trash and put in the right place we can save plants, animals in danger, and bugs. Also it makes our community look awesome. Also our community wont look bad meaning it make us look like we cant take care of our community.

Also touring may not look a community service but it is students can touter kids in need. This may help us and other kids in need. Another community service can be recycling. That way we can reuse reusable items and not waste them.

I hope I've convince you dear principal and with you're approval of this act even if a short time service it may help our neighborhood.

"I think summer projects should be student-designed. It is important for students to have a say in what they learn and how they learn it. When students are given the freedom to design their own projects, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated. This leads to a deeper understanding of the material and a more enjoyable learning experience.

For example, last summer I was able to design my own project on the topic of renewable energy. I was interested in learning more about solar panels and wind turbines, so I decided to build my own mini wind turbine. I spent the summer researching, designing, and building my turbine. I learned so much about the science behind wind energy and how to build a functional turbine. I even won a prize at the school science fair for my project.

On the other hand, when teachers design projects for students, they can be too structured and rigid. Students are not able to explore their own interests and may not be as motivated to learn. For example, my friend had to do a project on the Civil War, but she was not interested in history. She found the project boring and did not put much effort into it. If she had been able to design her own project, she may have chosen a topic that she was passionate about and put more effort into it.

Furthermore, student-designed projects allow students to develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and time management. When students are given the freedom to design their own projects, they must figure out how to approach the problem, what resources they need, and how to manage their time effectively. These skills are essential for success in college and the workforce.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are the way to go. They allow students to be engaged, motivated, and develop important skills. Teachers should give students the freedom to design their own projects and provide guidance and support when needed. This will lead to a more enjoyable and effective learning experience for students.",1
"Automation is certainly an idea of the future. Early on,inventors have wanted to make life easier for the average Joe. We have allready come so far with automobiles themselves. Making them safer, stronger, faster, more reliable. But now it seems like that just wasn't enough. Now, we are close to the ""next big step"" in the automoblie industry: driverless cars.

We have been striving to invent automated cars for awhile now. In the 1950's, General Motors had taken a crack at automated cars. The projetwas scraped becaus ethe modifications to the roads were too expensive. In the 1980's, cars had spped sensors installed for the antilock brakes. So really, i has been a progression of innovation to get to where we are. But smart cars have always been known to have some sort of flaw.

To me, the smart car is a bad idea. It's innovation but not in a good way. These new brands of cars will make drivers lazy and even more reckless on te road than they were allready.

The first issue with the smart car is that it still requires a drivers attention. They have tried to counter this problem by installing cameras to watch the driver. The report also mentioned installing entertainment systems into the vehicle. This is an invitation to disaster. If your purpose is to keep the drivers attention, why would you want to install a distraction? A driverless car would'nt be very driverless if a driver was needed in an emergency.

Another issue is how this new technology would hit the industy. Based on the report, this is mostly just a Google project now. So let's say Google wanted to monopolize on their new line of automobiles. How many other car manufacturers could potentially lose buisness. The auto buisness is allready hurting from foreign competion, so why do we have to take more jobs out by coming up with automated cars?

Automated cars are reliant on technology. So does any vehicle, but this one hangs heavy on it. What happens if your hardware shuts down? Would your average mechanic be able to fix a computer? No, they wouldn't. Anothernexample of where jobs would be lost. You couldn't go to your local repair shop anymoe, you'd have to have specialized workers look at your car for much more.

In short, smart cars are very expensive and uneccessary. If we still need a driver, your computer isn't a driverless car. If we do invest in smart cars, we will find even more jobs being taken over by specialists. Whats wrong with just taking a turn at the wheel?",0
"Most people think that the electoral college is not reasonable. I don't think they're wrong. The electoral college is very unfair. It is unfair because the people's votes might be overuled, the electoral college is biased, and they may not pay any attention to the people's opinions.

First of all, in some cases the popular vote might not be of any value. Besides, the popular vote doesn't matter in the decision for president it elects members for the electoral college. So if I wanted to vote for a republican president but the electoral college ends up voting for the democrat I would have wasted my time going to vote. Clearly, the electoral college's vote overrules the popular vote.

In addition to overruling the popular vote, the people on the electoral college are biased. If the people who are on the electoral college are biased then, they might not take people's votes into account to their electoral vote. I know no one would want their vote to be ignored so this is another reason why the electoral college should be abolished. If a democracy means the people decide who their leaders are, then why are there other people who might not represent the people chosing our president. Quite obviously, the electoral college is biased and might not care about the popular vote.

Furthermore, even if the people's votes go to the electoral college, the college might not even pay attention to the reasons people give to vote for someone. Most people don't really care that their votes go to deciding who is on the electoral college, but they are missing the point. The electoral college are made up of human beings and they will say no to ideas they don't like. I don't think that the fate of our country should be resting on the idea that if one person doesn't like someone they will reject the idea. Obviously, the electoral college might reject some ideas just because they don't like them.

To conclude, the electoral college cannot be trusted to decide the future of our great nation. This group of electors might be biased, their votes overrule the popular vote, and they might not be open to opinions. Consider these reasons for the electoral college not deciding the future of the United States. These people cannot be trusted to vote for our new president.",0
It would help to ask other people for advice but it helps when there's more than 1 person giving you advice. Each opinion can help you simplify your question. For example if you ask one person what they think you should do but you dont like their answer someone else could help cut down what you think feels right and wrong that could help you decide. When you ask other people for advice some times you can feel relieved and for some reason you dont feel like you are alone anymore and you don't have to worry as much as you used to. For example if someone were to be suicidal asking someone for help can make you feel relieved that there is a way to help that person. If you have more than one choice but you don't seem to like some of them you can ask a friend or a parent/guardian for some help on what to do. For example if I could choose to get a pet or not maybe someone has a pet and they could tell me the responsibility and cost of taking care of a pet. Maybe someone has experience that you don't so maybe it would be best asking for advice from someone who is more experienced. For example if I wanted to start getting more muscle I would ask someone I know that has been doing it for a long time to help me get more muscle by teaching me what to eat and what to not eat and what to do and how. One of the most important thing before you ask advice from the person is do you believe that he/her will not lie because if he/she gives you bad advice then you can make a very wrong decision thats why you need to be able to trust the person giving you advice. ,0
"Flight school can open up a world of exciting options for students interested in pursuing a career as a pilot. Before selecting a school, it is important to do research on the different types of careers related to aviation and their specific requirements. Additionally, high schools offering courses or qualifications related to these professions should be identified and evaluated. Furthermore, transportation from and to school must be considered for students who are unable to drive. Finally, the traditional requirements, such as grades and classes, needed to enter schools with a successful track record should be examined. By considering all of these factors, students can make an informed decision about their chosen career path.",1
"Chances for a better future are often snatched away from the vulnerable children in Bangladesh, particularly those suffering from abuse and those with an abnormality. This is due to many socioeconomic factors and the lack of appropriate support, leading to a myriad of developmental problems both now and later in life. To protect and help these children, it is essential that the Bangladeshi government act quickly to provide resources to families in need, especially those who are struggling to raise an abnormal child. 

Action needs to be taken to provide victims of child abuse with appropriate medical and legal assistance. It is also imperative to promote awareness about the consequences of child abuse, so that people in positions of authority or authority figures, such as teachers and healthcare professionals, can identify when a child is in danger and take the necessary steps to protect them. It is also important to provide more access to family and social services, such as counseling, legal advice, and educational interventions so that victims of abuse can receive the help they need. 

For children with disabilities, providing more resources and support is critical to give them the best chance of a successful life. Such resources may include specialized educators, supportive therapies, and the opportunity to attend special classes. There should also be measures in place that allow families to access government funding for medical assistance, access to housing and healthcare, and first step transition programs for disabled children. 

Taking action is essential to create a better future for the abused and abnormal children in Bangladesh. Furthermore, by helping these children, we can make a significant contribution to improving their quality of life and helping them realize their full potential. It is therefore critical that the Bangladeshi government takes necessary steps to protect these vulnerable children.",1
"In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as ""The Face on Mars."" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.

Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.

On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.

Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was. Now NASA had proved that this brilliant ""face"" was only a landform.

NASA did endless amounts of research in hopes of finding evidence of martian life, so why would they hide something like that? Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform. The research NASA has put into may not have given them the results they wanted, but it may later benefit them in finding life on Mars.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System also is calles the FACS is a interesting solfware. The can be use for great things, but human emotions are complicated. The system emotion need to be bigger cause human have more emotions then happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. I think that the FACS is bad for student to use right now.

The thing I do like abot the the solfware is that it can help alot of kids that wasn't tought right or just don't get certain things. For a solfware that can change the learning process just for you to make it more challenging or make it easier just for is amazing. This the way I look at the solfware will give everybody a better chance cause it not so straight forward as you read this and you have to understand or you can't pass on. Now It can find interesting things you like to read and it make people want to read. This machine also help the teachers cause they can't help every student if they have a class of 30 student.

This is were this solfware go wrong human have way more then six emotions. These emotion we have is very complicated to the point that we don't understand them some times. For a machine to change how we learn on facail expresion is bad because we can be sick and it change the actical cause it thing we are bored or disgusted. That might really like that artical. The same can be said if a person is in pain it can say that person is angry or sad. This is the big flaw with this machine even if it is rightthe teacher or someone can go look back at that and see everything you are feeling. that can be alittle to personal for some people.

This is my thought aboot the solfware. It is very great, and can be very helpful for a lot of people. The big flaws with it is that itcan be to personal for some people. The other big flaw with it the emotion part it vision it to narrow it need to be widen up cause it emotion people it might cagorize it under something it might not be.",0
"Unmasking The Face

A lot of people lately have been suspicous of my company NASA. While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The general public has all reasons to be suspicious torwards the ""Face of Mars!"" Sounds like something from ""The Twilight Zone."" Well, Mars, though so barren, might has well be considered the earth's twin sister... or brother. The two planet's sufaces have shown some interesting simularities, like water remnants and climates. Not to mention volcanoes. This is where we find the reason behind the face of Mars!

On our planet earth, we have land structures called ""Mesas."" These elevated lands are found in the ""American West"", where the surrounding deserts (used to be oceans in theory), are now filled with canyons, rock flats, salt flats, mesas, and other forms only found there. Mars might as well have a northwest region where one could find earthlike simularities. This may as well be the reason behind the face. Also, one should note that the shadows may be rocks making a shadow from the sunlight. Another logical explanation to look at France. Shaped like a boot, it is just a land form that naturally occured, looking like something we know.

My company would also like to state that this really ""isn't"" a cover-up. In true fact, the discovery of other life or remnants of one such time would be positive to us, and to our projects. So, say what you want. Believe in what you think, but we at NASA belive this isn't alien. Just another simularity between Mars and Earth.                                                                      ",0
"The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something.

When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.

As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematically try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.

In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.",0
"Dear Principal,

In my opinion, student should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. Students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch and free times because it can help them communicate with their parents and other peers.

Students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch because it could help them find their friends on the large school campus. Sometimes, when you don't know what class your friend has before lunch it is hard to finds them, and by having a cell phone you can call them and find them easily. Also, during lunch some students would want to call their parents to ask if they are bringing them a lunch, or if they should buy a school lunch. Students may also want to ask their parents if they can go to a friends house after school, and so they will not need to pick them up.

Having a cell phone would also help communication between students and friends from other schools, and between students and friends who are elsewhere on the campus. Students could call their friends to get help on homework or other school projects, or to plan what they are doing after school. Another reason why students should be able to have their cell phones on during free periods in school is because some students, if allowed, leave the campus to eat lunch, and their peers may be wondering where they are, when they are coming back, or to alert them that class has already started.

By not letting students have their cell phones in school, they would be unable to communicate with their parents or peers. The school staff may be worried that students may use their cell phones during class, but if students are allowed to use them in their free times they most likely will not use them while they are learning. Teachers are afraid that students secretly use their cell phones during class, and that it takes away from their education. However, if a student is caught using their cell phone during learning time they know it could be confiscated for the rest of the day.

Many students use their phones after school to contact their parents, friends, or carpool. Many times parents are late to pick their kids up, and if the kids have their cell phones they can call them to make sure they remember where they are. Students also use their cell phones after school to call their friends and ask if they want to hang out or go somewhere now that school ended.

In conclusion, students should be able to bring phones to school and only use them during lunch or other free periods, because it makes communicating easier. As long as cell phones are turned off and not used in class, they will not be a disturbance to the students learning and education.

Sincerely,

"Standardized tests have been a topic of debate in the education sector for many years. While some people believe that these tests are an accurate measure of student ability, others argue that they are not. In my opinion, I do not believe that standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability.

Firstly, standardized tests do not take into account the unique learning styles of students. Every student has a different way of learning and processing information. Some students may excel in a particular subject, while others may struggle. Standardized tests do not account for these differences, and as a result, some students may be unfairly penalized. For example, a student who is a visual learner may struggle with a test that is primarily based on reading comprehension.

Secondly, standardized tests do not measure a student's creativity or critical thinking skills. These tests are designed to assess a student's ability to recall information and solve problems within a specific set of parameters. However, they do not measure a student's ability to think outside the box or come up with innovative solutions to problems. In today's world, creativity and critical thinking are essential skills, and standardized tests do not adequately measure these abilities.

Finally, standardized tests can be biased against certain groups of students. For example, students from low-income families or non-English speaking backgrounds may struggle with these tests due to a lack of resources or language barriers. This can lead to unfair assessments of their abilities and may prevent them from receiving the support they need to succeed.

In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They do not take into account the unique learning styles of students, do not measure creativity or critical thinking skills, and can be biased against certain groups of students. As a result, we need to find alternative methods of assessing student ability that are more inclusive and comprehensive.",1
"I agree with policy 1. I agree with this policy because I have a cell phone of my own of which I use daily. I believe that we should be able to use our cell phones in school as long as we keep them on vibrate, and aren't using them during class time when we are supposed to be learning. That could be a real distraction to us, and the teachers if we are texting in the middle of class.

One other reason that I agree with policy 1 is because our parents buy our cell phones so that they can keep in touch with us. For example, what if there was an emergency in my family and I didn't have my cell phone on, I would be lost. Or even if I just put something somewhere at home and my mom just wanted to text me and ask me where I put it. Instead of having to call the school and take my class time away to ask a simple question.

One other reason that agree with policy 1 is because you should be able to call your mom or someone when you have a chance.      ",0

Topic: The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health

Project Idea: Create a Social Media Detox Challenge

As an 8th grader, I'm no stranger to social media. I'm constantly scrolling through my feeds, checking notifications, and sharing updates with my friends. But have you ever stopped to think about the impact social media has on our mental health? From cyberbullying to FOMO (fear of missing out), social media can have some pretty negative effects on our well-being. That's why I want to design a project that explores the impact of social media on mental health and encourages my peers to take a break from it.

My project idea is a Social Media Detox Challenge. Here's how it would work:

1. Research: First, I would research the impact of social media on mental health. I would look for studies and articles that explore the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness. I would also consider the potential benefits of taking a break from social media, such as increased productivity and improved sleep quality.
2. Brainstorming: Next, I would brainstorm ideas for the challenge. I would think about how to make it fun and engaging, while also encouraging participants to reflect on their social media use and its impact on their mental health. Some ideas I have include creating a social media-free day each week, taking a break from screens for a certain amount of time each day, or setting limits on the amount of time spent on social media.
3. Plan: Once I have a solid idea for the challenge, I would create a plan for how to execute it. This would include setting up a website or social media account where participants can sign up, providing resources and support for those participating, and promoting the challenge through school announcements, flyers, and word of mouth.
4. Implementation: During the challenge, I would check in with participants to see how they're doing and offer support and encouragement. I would also create a social media account where participants can share their experiences and connect with each other.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that kids should not be able to use there phones during school because of many reasons such as, not paying attention in class. Also if kids are aloud to use the phone during a free time might encourage them to use it in class. kids would get into lots more trouble with teachers if they use there phone in class.

First, kids should not be able to use there phone in class because, they will not pay attention in class. If kids are not paying attention in class then kids knowledge is not growing. We really need a smarter generation to help stop important stuff. Like someone in my generation could find a cure for cancer and become rich and successful. Someone in my generation could help the economy and things could be more affordable. also people could be not in debt. That is me first reason kids should not use there phones in school.

Second, If we have a free period of time were we can use are phones then that would cause trouble to because, since there phones are in there pockets it encourages them to use it in class. Also kids are not getting any smarter texting all the time. Soon kids will be using texting in there school reports and start to fail. That is my second reason why kids should not use there phones in school.

Finally, kids would start to fail there classes because, kids would start to into there texting and also calling people. Also kids would start to cheat on test by using there phones in class and getting answers from people. Soon kids would start to get caught and get into lots of trouble.

That is why I think phones should not be used in school.",0

"Cars have been an important part of transportation in society for many years. However, in some communities that is changing. Many young people are not getting their licenses and some are giving up their cars. The streets of Vauban, Germany, are mainly ""carfree"" and the suburb only has two places to park cars, at the expense of 40,000. Limiting car usage results in many advantages.

One of those advantages is helping the environment. The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer explains Paris, France, put a driving ban into effect because of smog rivaling that of Beijing, China. The ban was based on license plate number, only allowing certain numbers to drive on specific days. Eventually the ban was lifted because the smog had cleared enough. Limiting the number of people that used their cars resulted in cleaner air, which is healthier for everyone. If limits were put into effect into other places, that could reduce air pollution, helping the environment. Americans are also buying fewer cars and driving less than previous years. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says, ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". That is another example of environmental benefits from limiting car use. By utilizing other forms of transportation, the impact a person has on the environment is greatly reduced.

Another advantage that comes from limiting car use is lower stress and better mental health. In the suburb of Vauban, Germany, fiftyseven percent of families sold their cars to move there and seventy percent do not own cars. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". By not owning a car, a person has less stress and can relax when traveling. There is probably less focus needed when traveling without a car because there is no worry about other drivers. Bogota, Colombia has started the Day Without Cars, the goal being to promote alternate transportation. Violaters recieve fines of twentyfive dollars. In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". People could enjoy the outdoors, without the constant noise and pollution from traffic in the city. That could lower their stress and increase their happiness.

Limiting car use has many advantages, some of which are helping the environment and lowering stress. Some suburbs, specifically Vauban, Germany, are mostly ""carfree"". A trend of buying fewer cars and driving less is also growing in America, which is beneficial to the environment. Plus, the stress of driving a car is taken away when their use is limited.",0
"Do Google cars truly work? Can humans completely trust a machine to do all of the work for them with their lives on the line? Although Google cars are really interesting and intelligent, these cars cannot be trusted. These cars can only help a person drive and alert them when the task is too hard for the car. All drivers must remain alert throughout the ride, and not everyone can stay alert. Also, what happens if the car ends up in an accident? Someone will have to pay for the price, which can cause immense conflict. Therefore, Google cars should not be produced and sold to customers, for it will cause conflict and danger for everyone.

In paragraph seven, the author states that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This statement means that the cars cannot drive completely by themselves and will need a person to be alert in case the road ""requires human skills."" Although the seat vibrates to get the driver's attention, it is possible that some will not be able to react quick enough, which may cause a severe car accident.

Because of this problem, people must stay alert just in case they go though a road that requires human skills. The author states that ""the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This may seem like a simple issue, but it isn't; people who drive for a long period of time will get bored if they drive the Google car. In paragraph eight, the author questions this by asking, ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" If people get bored of waiting for their turn, then they will do something to get rid of their boredom, hence leading to a terrible accident.

When someone runs into a car accident, most people would blame the driver. In paragraph eight of the excerpt, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver of the manufacturer?"" Logically, both of them are at fault; the driver should have been paying attention, and the manufacturer should have known the consequences of selling the car. However, this will most likely unsatisfy the people. Everyone will get into a huge argument which will lead to an enormous conflict.

Google cars are an amazing invention, but it has some flaws; even if ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time,"" people should not trust the car. What about the other 10 percent? The 10 percent shows that it is possible that the car will get into accident, and that accident could lead to thousands of people dead. These accidents will most likely happen because people were not alert during the times they should have been. Can one trust these cars to take them anywhere with their lives on the line, or should they risk the 10 percent and hope for the best?    ",0
"State Senator, The Electoral College is not a fair way to vote. Instead of voting for who you would like to win, you are voting for an electors who says they will vote for the candidate you want to win. Voting for who we want is a part of our rights! The Electoral College system is not only out dated, but there has also been a few fiasco.

This style of voting has been going on since the beginning, there are many flaws that need to be worked on. A major problem would be the electorss they are not reliable. ""Can voters control whom their electorss vote for? Not always."" This right here proves that the electorss don't always tell the truth. Who picks the electorss anyways? ""Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" We don't even get to select our electorss, how are we supposed to rely on strangers to vote for who we would like? Would you trust a random stranger to take care of your child? It is the same as putting the fate of our country in the hands of someone some people have never even seen! ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,"" This information should prove to you that the Electoral College is unfair.

The disaster factor should have been the end to the Electoral College. ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Is there anything left to say? These people tried to sabotage the election. What is stopping more poeple from this? Some electorss refused to vote for who they said they would. ""faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" In 1960 Hawaii sent two slates of electorss to Congress! Thanks goodness for Vice President Nixon who ""validated only his opponent's electorss, but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent.'"" Also, many people stated that they prefer the direct election, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" With giving you this information, you should be able to infer that the Electoral College should be changed.

In conclusion, more people are against the Electoral College than with it. We should be able to vote for which one we prefer. Less people would have a problem with the election process and it would go a lot smoother.",0
"Some schools offer the option of attending classes by ""online"" or ""video conferencing"". This may not be a good idea because how does the student going to get responsible? or how can the teachers know if the student is not cheating on a test?. Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. Also, by this way attending to school students might join in sports, activities, etc. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. School gives classes of ""PE"" which is important because doing sports is healthy.

In 2015, a student at Generic_School took the option to attend classes by online because the student was not a ""social"" person which means the student did not like to communicate. But after all the student did regret it. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. The words of the student to advice the students were "" There is no more benefits than attending to school. School does help you to your knowdlegde and prepare you for your future. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you ""P.E"" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone."" The student had excellent grades, scholarships, made new friends than he expected to have. Where is he now by making the best option? He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had.

As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called ""Esol"". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different system's programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will.

In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. Going to school has more benefits than you think so you need to fight for it because anything in this life is not easy, but is worth it.",0
"Dear principal,

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

The school should make a contract saying that students that have a C average cant participate in sports or activities. The parents ,teacher ,principal ,and the student should sign the contract .The students that don't even try to work hard to get a B average should stay an hour after school to catch up the work they have been missing. the students that don't recognized that what their doing is wrong and they don't get privileges like other students do .

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME

"Human emotions have been around about as long as humans have. For milenia humans have been able to convey feelings through facial expressions for many hundreds of years. Peole have also figured out ways to fake or force emotions if they feel it necessary and have been doing so for hundreds of years. While classrooms are newer but feel boring to most,they are a big part of life. Classrooms might be boring, and while it has become possible to use new technology to make learning fun, but this begs the question, is it practical?

Computers are newer and facial recognition is on the rise but is the facial recognition software fit for a classroom? Facial recognition software might be available,but as the article mentions,personal computers can't handle the software. How are schools supposed to use something that requires a larger computer with only a small amount of money to spend? The article also doesn't mention how costly the software itself is so it could be too costly for schools. Most schools simply do not have the kind of money required for this new technology.

The new software could be used to make lesson plans more fun but is that practical. Ignoring how the schools would get this new software,the practical use of it has a cost of its own. Changing lesson plans to be more fun may sound practical,but what about the cost and different types of learning? There are different types of learning,auditory,visual,hands on,and probably more types of learning,but how are schools supposed to cater to those who like to learn differently than the rest? The methods of putting these other types of learning into effect would be far too costly for most schools an would probably require even more software and other technology.

The costs of practical facial expression recognition software usage are big but ignoring that, will people accept a comuter watching their facial expressions? Though the article mentions about facial expressions and analyzing them, it fails to take into account how people feel about this. According to the article,this software could be used to tell if a student is bored,but would students be comfortable with a machine that could tell how they were feeling just watching them as it taught? Many students would feel uncomfortable being watched constantly especially by a computer that could analyze how they were feeling. Not to mention the fact that for some forms of learning the computer might be forced to move around with the help of other technology to give examples which might make students more uncomfortable.

In conclusion while facial reading software seems like a good idea,maybe it isn't. The software wouldn't be compatible with school computers. The cost of replacing the computers and putting the new and more fun learning techniques into practice would be very costly. Many students would feel uncomfortable with this new technology and some things students are forced to learn simply can't be made fun easily. While it might seem like a good idea on the surface,some things just aren't practical.",0
"The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. Information from Nasa has led us to conclude that it was created by natural causes.

When the ""Face on Mars"" was first discovered, the picture seen was captioned, ""huge rock formation."" The discription then goes into detail about how shadows gave an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The public made up their own minds on how this Face had formed. The ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon and was present in many films, books, and even radio stations.

The lack of evidence of life on Mars led people to also believe that NASA was withholding information regarding aliens or other life forms. These theories can not hold true because NASA would benifit greatly on finding life on Mars. NASA's profits would begin to increase.

Pictures were later taken to confirm that there is no alien monument on Mars. The picture actually showed a Martian equivalent of a butte or mess, landforms which are common on Earth.

Based on thorough evidence and research, NASA has come to conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform. ",0

"Phones and driving

Phones are something that almost everyone has now. They are good to use for many reasons but one thing that there not good for is when you're driving there are a lot of distractions already over 100 cars, blind spots people in the car music but the biggest is phones, with phones your taking your eyes off the road and anything could happen when your eyes is hooked in the screen for a split second. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds

Another reason why phone and driving should not go together can cause a person to be more reckless while driving if someone says something on the phone to you it can lead to many different thing on the road it can make a person think and not notice the red light and it an ongoing car and cause injury or worse to both of the drivers you can be enraged and cause harm to you or others

It is safer to just stop with phone and driving because they don't mix right in the end and they will be less mistakes on the road because of it the best way to see it is that there other people lives on the road and it wouldn't be cool if someone die because if one text or call   ",0
" Is it possible to change your first impression? Many people believe that first impressions are set in stone and cannot be changed, but this is not entirely accurate. With the right mindset, effort, and a little bit of confidence, it is possible to alter your first impression.

First and foremost, if you want to change your first impression, you need to have a clear vision of how you want to change it. Without a clear idea of what you want to achieve, you will struggle to make any progress. It's important to remember that failure is not an option, and that willpower is key to achieving your goals.

Secondly, having a clear vision is just the first step in changing your first impression. The hard work is where the real challenge lies. It's important to approach the task with a positive attitude and not get discouraged by setbacks or obstacles. Remember that challenges are opportunities for growth and that perseverance is essential to achieving your goals.

Lastly, confidence plays a crucial role in changing your first impression. If you lack confidence, it can be difficult to make positive changes. However, it's important to remember that confidence can be built over time through practice and self-reflection. You can take classes or seek out mentors to help you develop your confidence and leadership skills.

In conclusion, changing your first impression is possible with the right mindset, effort, and a little bit of confidence. Remember to have a clear vision of what you want to achieve, approach the task with a positive attitude, and build your confidence through practice and self-reflection. With these skills, you can make positive changes in your first impression and improve your chances of success in the future.",1
"Former British Prime Minister Winston once said that ""sucess consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiam and basically its asking me if i agree on it.

Basically i really have never heard about this prompt but i find it reallu intersting and would love to know more about it, I feel like if there were to ask me an a public place for example now but instead a public place and read about it more and even just reading a little bit about it makes me agree on it.

In my opinion i would definitly agree on it since what he said was pretty true, he basically said something that is basically true and not only that its basically making you think that it is right that ""sucess consists on many thing but for sure loss of enthusiams""which is not wrong now i feel like ive thought about it just couple minutes and its making me think alot about it specially how much ive failed and life and always got up back like nothing was wrong.

May not be true for many people but for sure for me,I would agree on it 100% without doughting it at all , its always the ones that have failed and gotten up who would agree on it, it could be tuff for many to accept it but eventually they would agree to it if they were to think about how many times they have failed and won there battled with fighting for it and doing basically what they really want in their life. All you have to do to get through things are get stronger and work on yourself more, feel valued to your surroundings.

However, I have failed so many times and always thought about how i wouldnt make it not even how hard i try to i wasnt gonna make it out of the dark place i was in and eventually i told myself that it was very pointless of even trying anymore if all i was going to do is fail all over again , I didnt have no type of enthusiam whatsoever was horrible and all i did everyday was loss my enthusiam more and more until one day i got back up like a normal day and said to myself that ""Life doesnt get easier you only have to get stronger' and i realized so much at that moment i wouldnt even believe myself that i was up like nothing and day ago i was not in the right mindset thinking i was a completely failure and even didnt have enthuasiam for nothing. so last i would agree to the saying of the Former British Prime Minister Winston it made me realize alot and a very true saying of course,",0
"I disagree with requiring all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars provide many benefits, mandating participation prevents students from choosing how to spend their time outside of classes. 

Some students need time after school for other priorities like jobs, family responsibilities or independent studies. Forcing extracurricular involvement could negatively impact those students' lives outside of school. It's unfair to penalize students who have good reasons for not joining clubs or sports teams.

Instead of mandating participation, schools could encourage involvement through clear communication about potential benefits. Showcasing activities that cultivate life skills, boost college applications or are simply enjoyable ways to socialize may inspire more voluntary participation. Students who want to pursue personal interests or down time should still have that choice.

Providing many options for extracurriculars allows each individual student to find the best fits for their unique strengths, schedule and goals. A one-size-fits-all requirement ignores student diversity and prevents self-directed learning outside the classroom. Schools should aim to enhance high school experiences, not dictate how students spend every hour. With optional rather than mandatory extracurriculars, all students have fairness and flexibility in deciding how to balance academics with other priorities.",1
"Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change and I asked to other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good, it also can be that they don't treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act in a different way I thought that it's a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer.

My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely,for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school anymore I only wanted to have fun; this year I havent moved but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I don't feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really don't want to leave them (the people here are great).

In some reasons the people don't treat everybody the same way because each persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it hap pend to me one time and I really didn't like it; it was one time that I went to a party and I was going to meat up with a group of friends wen I got there they didn't want to talk to me I wondered why but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them and it was because they told them something that I didn't even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didn't tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me so things got fixed and we went to party all night and to have fun.

The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act in a different way because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they can't control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he can't control his character but they were teachers that will explain what he had and they would be better and not say things about hem.

Well now that we sow all this I think that I am correct people don't always be be perfect, everybody makes errors in life or someone causes them. Thankyou for hearing me today!!

Have a great day!!",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole. This can be seen in examples like the German suburb of Vauban, the city of Paris, and the capital of Colombia, Bogota. These places have implemented measures to reduce car dependency and have experienced positive outcomes in terms of reduced pollution, improved quality of life, and increased accessibility to alternative modes of transportation.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while car-intensive areas in the United States can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, as seen in Vauban and Paris, significant decreases in pollution levels and congestion have been achieved. The recent driving ban in Paris resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped clear the smog that had plagued the city (Duffer). These efforts not only improve air quality but also contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also improve the quality of life for individuals. Vauban, a car-free suburb in Germany, has shown that living without cars can reduce stress and make people happier (Rosenthal). The presence of cars in cities and suburbs often leads to traffic congestion and noise pollution. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation like walking, cycling, and public transit, individuals can enjoy quieter and less congested streets. This can create a more peaceful and pleasant living environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to increased accessibility to public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. Vauban, for example, has made stores easily accessible by placing them within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls (Rosenthal). This approach encourages people to use alternative modes of transportation to reach their destinations, reducing the need for car travel. Similarly, Bogota's car-free day promoted alternative transportation methods like walking, biking, and taking buses (Selsky). By providing better infrastructure for these modes of transportation, more people have the opportunity to utilize them and reduce their reliance on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages to individuals and society. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, and creates a more pleasant living environment. Additionally, it enhances accessibility to alternative transportation methods, making it easier for people to choose alternatives to driving. As seen in examples like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, these measures have the potential to make cities and suburbs more sustainable and enjoyable places to live. It is important for individuals and communities to prioritize limiting car usage in order to reap these benefits and contribute to a more sustainable future.",1
"Summer is mostly a time for kids to relax and wind down from the stress that school causes. Summer projects can seem like a burden but in reality they are very beneficial. Nevertheless summer projects should be given out to insure that kids dont fall behind when they go back to school in the fall and so that the transition from summer to school is much easier for the kids and teachers. Summer projects should be teacher-designed for the reasons that they know what will be thought in the upcoming year and they will also challenge kids to do their best work.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to them knowing what the curriculum demands them to teach. Kids have minimal to no idea of what they will learn in the upcoming year but teachers on the other hand are given an overview of what the kids should learn throughout the school year. So it seams very foolish to let a kid make up their own project without them knowing what is expected of them. A kid can not magically know what they need to do their project on. They might be able to design the project but in reality they could just be wasting their time doing a project that has nothing to do with what they will learn in the upcoming year. It is not beneficiary for the kids to work on a project that has nothing to do with what they will learn in school. It also dose not benefit the teacher considering that the kids will walk into class not knowing a thing. The teacher will have to wast time introducing the subjects, where if the teacher would have designed the project that would not be needed.

Another reason why summer projects should be designed by teachers is due to the fact that they will challenge their kids in doing the best work possible. Teachers wont cut corners when it comes to teaching and informing the future of this world because thats their passion. Teachers know how important it is that kids constantly practice and or learn new things throughout the summer. If they dont it is very likely that the kids will not retain all the information they learned from the perverse school year. That could cause a slow start to the year due to the teacher having to refresh the kids on some subjects. Teachers wont create summer projects that only take a couple of minutes to complete, but instead give projects that will have the kids doing the project in little sections throughout the summer. This would result in the kids coming up with a system which would not only help them prioritize their time but also have them consistently doing school work.

While some may say that summer projects should be student-designed, that is not the case. If kids where able to design there own summer projects it would be highly unlikely that they would make something that challenges them. Kids are not focused on spending there time creating a challenging project for school; on the contrary, kids just want to have the best possible summer. There would be no structure whatsoever leaving the kids to make all the decision. They would chose easy topics that would only take a couple of minutes to complete. Due to that they would be self compromising their opportunity to really show what kind of good work they can truly do.

It seems very clear that summer projects should not be student-designed but teacher-designed. Teachers know exactly what the kids should practice and learn during the summer so that they are prepared to have a smooth transition for playing outside with their friends to learning in the classroom. It would also prevent kids from taking the easy way out and designing a project that would take a couple of minute to complete. On top of that they would also be hurting the teacher, classmates, and themselves in the fact that they wont be prepared when school starts. This causes a chain of affects that in the end helps no one but hurts everyone. Summer should be a time to relax and have fun but kids should always have school in the back of there heads. ",0
"A old man told me once "" the future dose not come to you. you go to the future"". I agree with the principal making every student do one extracurricular activity. The principal making every one do extracurricular activities is a good idea. Its a new way to make friends and have fun, and it can help find what you might want to do in your future.

Making everyone do a extracurricular activity is beneficial for the students and the school. These extracurricular activities will help people be able to make new friends because they will share a common interest .When I grew up in Generic_City from first to third grade. I did a lot of extracurricular activities .one of them were soccer. I met a couple of kids that also liked soccer too. So me and my friends would stay after school to play soccer everyday.

extra curicular activites would help us find our passion for what we want do in the future. extra curiculat activitys might help student what they want to do in their future at a very young age. people who are in journalism club might want to be a journalist in the futrure. people who loved scince club and all the cool experiments might want to become a scientist when they grew up.

When the old man first told ""future dose not come to you. you go to the future."" I was confused. every second that passes by I go a little bit into the future but now I get it. I cant expect my future dream job to just fall into my hands. I need to work to get it. in the end making everyone do extracurricular activities are beneficial. they would help us find what we wanted to do with our future and help us make new freinds.",0
"i think this should be a thing because it would help people work when on a computer. it would help people becasue it would make them more enjoyable for the person that is working. it would help because if th user is not satisified by the way a lession is performing the computer would know that an change the application to make it more interesting to the spicific user. also it would be diffrent for everybody and everyone has a diffrent way of learning certain things. doing this would make studfence preform better because th appilication that they are using conforms to them specifically. the only bad thing about this is that some people would say that it is invading peoples thoughts and that it should not be able to know everything down to emotions in a person. the othe rthing wrong with this is that we dont have the capeability to have that in the common computers that we have today , simply because they would have to be way bigger just to have the space to hold all the facial recognition codes for every emotion. those are the reasons i think that facial recognition in a school computer would be helpful.

"I think policy 1 should be allowed because they can us there phones but during class everyone is fine without texting or whatever there doing. If we didn't have phones at our school there would be nothing else to do at lunch or when you have free time to do what you want to do. But if they get caught with it out during class then they would have to play a fee to get it back. Also if we could use it all day no one would pay attention in class they would be on there phone all day but we should be able to use them most of the day. An plus if we did have our phones out all day people would be cheating on test an texting friends in other classes an distracting them from what there doing, but that's why we shouldn't have them out all the time just sometimes like lunch and in the hallways, but if like someone's mom calls we should be able to awnser it in case if its an emergency.

I think that policy 2 is kind of over board because now days people cant stand not being without there phones so its like our baby's to us. if we didn't have them today our technology wouldn't be like it is today, but as i was saying we should be able to have our phones because its all us kids do is play on our phones an we have nothing else to do. Also we could use our phones for like emailing a teacher for our homework or asking how were doing in class if there's something wrong that i need to fix.",0
"All over the world you see people playing football, soccer, basketball, and many more. the reason for this is many people enjoy staying active. No teenager would want to stay home doing nothing but tedious work or chores. It is a fact that 75% of teenagers have an after school activity they do. In school some students are in an average of no higher than a C, but others are highly qualified to get better grades. The C average students are expecting to try their hardest at sport as a backup in a good collage. Relying on your responsibility, dedicating to get better, and succeeding to get into a better college are reasons why principals should allow for all grade average students to play sports.

To begin with, relying on your responsibility is a great highlight in sports. For example, the series of charmed. Three sisters commit themselves to fight for each other and each others lives. Going through harrowing experiences against evil forces they still rely on their responsibility and preserver like hero's to their community. Teenagers will act the same toward their sports. They will try their hardest on their school work, but also on their sports. Therefore, gaining back on your responsibility helps students with their sports.

Moreover, a student dedicating themselves to get better. Historically speaking, when the declaration of independence was taking place in the united states. We had to dedicate ourselves to gain our property from the British. To make everything better we had to go through rough times and allay ourselves back on track. Many students do the same now in present day. No one would like to see one of their students fail at one thing and not trying at the next. Students all over push themselves to do better, don't let them try with out getting something in return.

Additionally, succeeding to get into a better college are main examples. ""Rules of the Game"" by Amy Tan illustrates determination. This is about a young girl who ends up being a master in chess. She puts all her gut into learning more and more about the strategies in chess. She wants to place herself into a well known tournament and succeed into making herself proud. Many students want to feel happy that they can at least do one type of sport right and get a good scholarship because of it.

In Summation, Relying on their responsibility is one example of what students are meaning to do. They also dedicate themselves to get better and want to succeed to get into better collages. Just because their average is not as high doesn't mean their qualities in a sport are not well. Let them do sport and get a relief out of it, it will make them proud and try harder in school.",0
"Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot.",0
"There are so many new techinologies in the world, such as diverless cars and many more technologies. Science and technology have advanced so the cars can sense and drive by themseleves. In the article ""Driverless cars are coming,""

there are some postive and negative aspects of the diverless cars such as Sensing the world, Driving and assisting the driver, but beside that should we or not have driverless cars.

We should have driverless cars. Diverless cars are easy to use and any age group can use them. The cars can sense and warn the driver about the dangers and that will increase the safety of the drivers. In the article it states that "" Futher improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make drving safer are also leading to cars that ca handle more and more drving tasks on their own."" In this line it tells us that these cars will handle more than just driving. In fact it will also take care of the safety of the driver.

Do we really need driverless cars. Is technology taking over. If we really think about it do we even need driverless cars. If we have cars that don't need drivers to drive them that means some peoples will be out of there jobs. So does it mean in the future the cars will make humans more lazy and jobless.

No, we don't need driverless cars, because we are making people more careless. In the article it states "" The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" In this line it tells us that the car will mimic the skill of a human. Who will asure us about our safety in the car. Who will we blame for the technology. In the article it states "" laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" In this line it tells us that we still need laws that will cover the liability in case of a accident and one more thing to think about who will take in charge of the accident the car company or the driver if an accident happens.

In conclusion, there are some negative and postive aspects of driverless cars such as who will take in charge of an accident. An negative aspects of driverless cars is that if those cars come in the market, what will happen to the drivers who drive the cars and earn from driving an car such as taxi drivers. An postive aspect will be that the new driverless cars will insure the safety of the passengers and they will not be distracted. So there are many good and bad aspects of driverless cars.    ",0
"Students around the world always wish to attend classes at home, or even video conferences just to stay at home. Therefore some of the students never thought how its going to effect them from graduating and moving up in life. When we go to school the teachers, consular, and even our friends there for us when we need the help. Students like us mostly think home is our way to escape from school and get away from everything.

It can really effect students grades and mind set about colleges; But they never thought how it can help them from going to school instead of doing online classes. What if we stay home; we can confused easily just by something very small. Although we are at school, if we got a questions or have a issue with something personal and dont want to tell your parents about it, we have consular's, teachers, and even friends around us that will help you. If you want to know about colleges or even about your GPA your consular are at the school open to talk to any students. Our consular are always here for the students even if they dont answer they emails on time. Even when our consular out, students also have their teachers if they have questions about some great colleges.

When students have online classes they probably doesn't get the help students at school get when they having trouble. What if you get stuck on a question or having trouble understanding a question; they gonna have to email the teacher but sometimes teachers don't answer on time because they teaching a class. If you think about it, it would be better if you are there in class getting the lesson so if you have a question you can ask them it. When students at home doing the online classes, they would probably skip the class and just fail the class. But students at school when they do skip they get caught up because they would go to one class and skip the rest and think they would get caught and maybe make up the class. Being at home doing the classes you would probably have trouble catching up since you would fail the class unless you go to summer school.

SOL, Its very important for students like us to pass it to graduate. The Students that goes to school; around SOL times they start staying after school getting help or just getting extra credit so they can pass that class also too graduate. When you doing online classes or video conferences some of the teachers doesn't required extra help because you take online classes, but its all up to the teacher you have. Some people when they do online classes they do it because they don't got to worry about getting help or graduating; they want to have a excuse to not do it. Graduating is very important, you need to graduate so you can get your future job or anything. So its very important to try your hardest to pass high school and come to school to get the help you need now..

Students should want to come to school to get what they need to leave high school. Even if you don't like school, maybe try to come because your friends are here; just try your best to gradate, get the help you need to get out of high school without doing online classes or video conferences.",0
"What would it be like to have a driverless car? If cars could drive on their own many of the mistakes that humans make on the roads would be eliminated, causing less accients and less injuries from car crashes. Driverless cars would make the roads a safe place and cause less stress on the person controlling the car.

Driverless cars are built to allow the car to steer, accelerate, and brake on its own. With these features it would cause less people trying to speed passed each other for going to slow, or cause the driver to not have to take a sharp stop because they we going to quick for a yellow light. The car are also built with a laser beam the would show a 3-D model of the surrounding of the driver, which allows it to know everything that is happening and how to react. If there is some construstion going on ahead or a crash the car also alarms the driver to take control.

Not only are the different types of cars that can cause accidents, but the person behind the wheel too. With there being so many different types of people driving everyday such as: new drivers, elderly, and careless drivers, it would be great to have a car that would control all the different gears that the driver would usually have to do. Since so many teen drivers think that they can text while driving or goof around, an accident is bound to happen, some worse than others, but still they then have to pay for the damage, but with the driverless car it allows the vieicle to take control of the wheel and cause the crash to never happen. Also when it comes to elderly or drunk drivers they never fully have an eye out for what can happen and are not quick enough to react to it, so if the car can pull the brakes on its own then that would save another situation to never happen.

Since the road is such a dangerous place there is no room for texting or making a mistake. It seems like driverless cars are the right thing to do since so many people get in crashes, or cause death from an accident. Driverless cars seem to be the safe choice, and can save many lives. ",0
"When faced with making a crucial decision in life, it can be helpful to seek advice from a variety of sources. A trusted family member, expert in the field, or even an authority figure can provide a valuable perspective and give you the confidence you need to make the right decision. 

Family members can have insight into your particular situation and offer helpful, objective advice. This is especially true if they have been through a similar experience and can relate to what you are going through. Seeking professional advice from an expert can also be beneficial. An expert in the field can provide you with in-depth knowledge and may even have resources that can help you make an informed decision. 

Finally, it’s important to take into account the opinions and ideas of authorities. They can offer sound advice and provide valuable guidance in making big decisions. They also have extensive experience and can provide ways on how to approach an issue.

Ultimately, seeking advice from family, experts, and authorities before making big decisions can be a great way to gain insight, receive assurance, and increase the chances of making a weighted decision. Such advice can give you the courage to be sure and confident in your choice.",1
"Having a positive attitude in life has a plethora of benefits. It’s often said that a positive outlook on life is half the battle, and it can be incredibly important for success. With a positive attitude, job opportunities can be more easily obtained. Employers often prefer those with a strong, positive disposition, and a negative attitude can be detrimental when interviewing for a job. In addition, a positive attitude can be immensely helpful when making decisions. Being confident in one’s decisions and having a clear perspective can be important when working towards a desired goal. A positive attitude can also be beneficial when facing difficult life situations. It can give strength to endure through hardships and peace of mind to not be overcome by stress and anxiety.

While some may argue that one’s Intelligence and hard work is more than enough for success, it shouldn’t be overlooked that often a positive attitude is necessary for success. In many cases, hard work and a sound attitude can be beneficial together. The two can come together to create an effective strategy where both can complement each other and contribute greatly to an individual’s success. Therefore, it may be argued that a positive attitude in life is just as important as one’s intelligence and hard work.",1
"Technology has had a profound impact on our lives, both good and bad. On the one hand, technology has enabled us to become more connected than ever before, allowing us to communicate and collaborate with people around the world. This has revolutionized the way businesses work, helped create jobs, and given us access to information at a speed that was previously unimaginable. On the other hand, technology has also created new problems, such as cyberbullying, identity theft, and the spread of misinformation. By allowing us to access too much information too quickly, technology can also lead to feelings of information overload, alienation, and even depression.

In conclusion, while there are many positive impacts of technology on our lives, we must also be aware of its potential pitfalls. To counteract the potential negative impacts of technology, it is important to take steps to ensure that technology is used responsibly and safely. This includes monitoring the way we use technology, as well as implementing safety measures to protect our data and privacy. With these measures in place, the positive impacts of technology can hopefully be maximized while its potential harms are minimized.",1
"If I was working for NASA and l had an argument with a person that believes that ''the face'' was created by aliens, I would say that it is just a simple landform that was made on mars. I say this because if I were to work for NASA I would look back at data that will help me defend my answer, that ''the face'' was not created by aliens. For all we know it could just be a mountain that has ''eyes'', ''a mouth'', ''and a nose'' due to shadowing.

We human beings really have no clue if there are aliens or not, we find ''clues'' and believe there are but, in my opinion there are none.

"Dear principal,

Everyone needs cell phones right? Many students at various schools have their cell phones with them all the time. Many students even try to text during class, even if it means getting poor academic grades. The two new policies that you have proposed, seem to bring a solution. Even though, with all due respect, one policy seems to not be a good idea. I think that policy number 2 is an excellent idea.

I think that policy number 2 is the better choice because it allows students to be more concentrated in their homework, their school work, and their personal school achievements. If a cell phone is allowed to be used during free-time or during lunch, the students may get distracted on what they are supposed to be learning from their teachers during class. If cell phones are to be not allowed in school, the students have a very good chance of not getting distracted while they are in class. This will allow them to be concentrated on their studies, than rather their social life, while in class.

I think that policy number 1 is a very bad idea because students may take this chance to text and take pictures during class while using their cell phones. This may cause a very big distraction towards their learning environment and academic grades as well as their concentration towards the material being taught to them by their teachers. Teachers may also take as a very bad situation because the students in their class would not learn any of the required academic material.

This would also implicate the students getting poor academic grades. The students who would be using their cell phones while in class would get grades such as C, D, or even F. Students may not be able to culminate or graduate because of these scores and grades. These grades would also implicate the results of their CST scores as being very low. This would bring the school's reputation as well as the CST scores to a less appropriate stance towards the LAUSD records.

These are my reasons for choosing policy 1. I think that these reasons are well enough qualified to change your mind about policy 2. I hope you take my opinion into consideration.",0
"""Why Driveless Cars Are Not Safe?""

I believe that driveless cars should not be developed because these cars are not safe, they're not developed completely, and if the driver is not taking caution it can cause harm to other.

My first reason why I believe that driveless cars should not be developed is that they are not safe because sometimes it requires human skills when going through work zones or accidents. If the driver is not alert and is sleeping and the driveless cars notices a work zone or accident the driver is not going to know. Right now the traffic laws have written that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Driveless cars are illegal in most states because of safety precautions. Even if they were legal the trafic laws would have to make new laws to cover liability in care of accidents.

My second reason why I believe that driveless cars should not be developed is that driveless cars are not developed completely. The car driveless car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but alll driveless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead of them requires human skills. Since they arent not developed completely the driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when they there is a situation that requires human skills. The cars can be driven more than half a million miles without crashing, but the Google cars are really driveless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or with complicated traffic issues.

Finally, my third reason why I believe that driveless cars should not be developed is that if the driver is not taking caution they could cause harm to other people. If the driver sleeping and not paying attention to the road even though it is a driveless car it could cause harm to the driver and other people. Since the driveless cars are not fully developed the driver has to make sure that they are staying alert. Even though it might have a sensor in the car what if it sensor fails then how will the driver be alert that a traffic situation is ahead. Right now the traffic laws say the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Also driveless cars are illegal in most states and its also illegal even to test computer driven cars.

These are the reason why I believe that driveless cars are not to developed because they are not safe, they are not developed completely, and if the driver is not taking caution they could cause harm to other people.",0
"Kids don't always make it to school. They might be sick, sleep in too late, have family issues, or are just on a vacation. To keep on track with their learning some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. This could be useful for students who are sick a lot, are on vacation, or they just couldn't get to school that day.

When students are sick and they have to stay home from school they miss a lot of content that they have to make up without the teacher's lesson. A student might get lost and not learn the material correctly because the teacher wasn't there to help them or they just didn't do the work at home. If they had a video lesson from their teacher they would learn the material, do the work along with it, and fill in any notes that they missed from that class period.

Lets say that a student went on vacation in the middle of the year and missed a week of class, they would have to make that all up themselves without the teacher's lesson to help or guide them. The student will fall behind immensely and their grade will drop. The student will eventually fail the

SOLs because they took a vacation and fell behind. The online class will prevent that by helping them while they are gone.

When a student oversleeps they usually have their parent or older sibling drive them to school, but what if they don't have an extra ride to school and just have to miss their classes. The online class would be perfect for a situation like this where they just couldn't make it to school. Also the online class could work for students that don't have a specific class at their school that they want to take, so they can use the online class to take the class from another school.

In the end, online classes could be useful for students that miss a lot of school or just aren't there all the time. It could be used for students that can't take a specific class, that are sick for a few days, or just couldn't make it to school on time.",0
"Dear Mrs. Principal

Cell phones are not necessary although they are being depended upon too much in today's society. I believe students should not be able to use their phones during the school day. I think you should stay with policy 2 because cell phones cause fighting, not everybody owns a cell phone, and these devices are distracting.

When you wanted to tell your best friend a secret, didn't it annoy you when you had to wait until nobody is around? Well now with cell phones people can just text the secret to their friend so nobody gets hurt right? Wrong. Most people realize when their friends are talking behind their back. If they find out you said something horrible about them they'll probably be as mad as bull that was just let out of his cage. Now your best friend won't talk to you or even be around you long enough to explain what really happened. If she finds out what you sent and it was either something you were told as a confidant or something bad about her then it may even get physical resulting in one or both of you being suspended. All of this could have been avoided if you never sent that text message during lunch.

It's hard to believe but not everybody can afford a phone payment. When a poor student sees everybody on their cell phone it makes them feel left out. Studies show, 67% of fighting is caused by jealousy. Nobody likes being made fun of because they don't have the latest ""in"" clothes and definitely nobody likes being teased of for their lack of a phone. Even if you have a phone it may feel disintegrating when people have the brand new iPhone 4 and you're stuck with your moms ten year old flip phone.

Although the rule is no cell phones during class, students still text and look at their phones while their teacher is teaching. Typically, there are students who don't want to be at school and they think since they don't want to be there nobody else does; but they're wrong. Learning is hard when you hear the buzz of someone's cell phone going off every five seconds. When you hear the noise you can't help but wonder who they're texting and what they're talking about which distracts you from the lesson you are trying to learn. Facts prove, when cell phones are not in the classroom the students averages increase dramatically opposed to those who have cell phones ringing all the time.

All in all, I hope you enforce policy 2. Banning cell phones from being used during school will decrease the amount of fights between friends, eliminate pupils from being looked down on for their lack of a cell phone, and help students focus better during school. No one will die if they are unable to text for a couple of hours. Weakening the dependency on cell phones will make this world a better place.",0
"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains a worthy scientific endeavor, despite the formidable dangers it presents. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" several key points of evidence are presented to support this assertion. 

Firstly, Venus provides a unique opportunity to learn about the evolution of terrestrial planets. As Earth's sister planet, studying Venus can yield insights into how planetary conditions like temperature, atmosphere and geography developed over time. Comparative planetology allows scientists to better understand Earth's formation and long term climate stability. Any new information gained has value, even if acquiring it poses risks. 

Further evidence is that technological advances are gradually reducing those risks and making exploration more feasible. Robotic probes like the Soviet Venera spacecraft in the 1970s showed exploration is possible with dedicated engineering. Current technologies like aerostat balloons could explore Venus's atmosphere safely for longer periods. The article discusses ongoing projects by NASA and other space agencies working to develop durable materials and sustainable power sources capable of enduring Venus's hellish environment. With each successful mission, our understanding grows while hazards lessen.

In conclusion, the author makes a reasoned case that studying Venus holds continual worth as a field of scientific inquiry. Though dangers exist, valuable geological and atmospheric data can be collected to inform planetary science. By exploring one of Earth's closest celestial neighbors, we expand human knowledge with applications that may one day aid problems like climate change back on our own world. Technologies also progress in a way that incrementally tames Venus's hazards, creating new opportunities down the line. For these sound evidentiary reasons, the pursuit of Venus exploration remains scientifically justified and holds promise of ongoing rewards.",1
"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College is a very unfair to many of the states.Some states are left in the dust without being visited or even seeing anything about a campaign. Also the voting is misleading because they vote for electrols not the president which the people should be voting for.In the passage

The Indenfensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong states

"" Under the electoral college system ,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" this information tells us that Electoral College is wrong and should be changed.

Voting for a new president is left for the electors we choose as a state to pick and we dont even get a say in the matter because we can not control who they vote for and it could be very confusing and people might vote for the wrong person.In the passage

The Indenfensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong states ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case ,Elections would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" With this information it shows that the election is out of the people hands that are going to be governed but to the governement that can make very bad decsions and has the United States populations fate in there hands and make the wrong move and have a crisis for the next four years to come.Also the winner take all system doesnt spread eqaully through the states, In the 2nd source it states"" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina ,and voter in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" This shows that it doesn't matter that the candidates go to get states because they only depend on certain states that have alot of elctorols like California and Texas an Ohio.

The Electoral College idea is outdated and irrational and needs new ideas that wil make voters happy. It would be easier just to have a popularity vote to pick the president instead of going through so much chaos with all the election. Ther should be campaigns and a couple of debates but then one big election that every one vote on at the same time to elect our president. This idea might help bring togetheir the population in each states to decide on one president to run our nation. The Senate and the House of Represeitatives already have a job and doesn't need to be taking the job of the citizens. To prove my point in passage 2

The

Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sysem are wrong states ""

In 1976 a tie would have occurres if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted theother way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"" The citizens can be confused and easily mislead if something is confusing like the Electoral College. Swing voters can change everything .

In this type of election there can also can be segregation invovled which unfair because mostly all people in the Senate and The House of Represantives are white and maybe have a problem with different races or women becoming the next president.  In source 2 the last paragraph :

""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.And the arguments against elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this but Bob Dole was right:

Abolish the electoral college!""

I agree with this is and I beleive that the Electoral College should be abolished because it is so unfair to the voters because thet are mislead and are not voting for the prsident but for the electors to vote for the president. I hope you agree with my opinion and decide to take this matter in your own hands and make a better election and happy citizens.

"The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.

A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?

Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

There is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.     ",0

If you want to go on an adventure Seagoing Cowboy is perfect because Luke once went and they visited China it took a long time but they still went and Luke said it was great.

Some details that Luck gave in the article were pretty amazing. You could actually imagine it in yor head. The way he described everything. So you should not waste an oppurtunity of a lifetime it is advetures,fun,you get to vist a lot of places. If you love animals you get to be with animals. It may take a long time to get to the destination the ship is going but you could take something along to do or play with the animals. You just have to feed them and clean them or else they are going to get all stinky and unhealthy and the ship will smell bad. Some other details that can support Lukes claim is that in the article it said that the cowboys play baseball and volleyball when the animals are unloaded they play in the empty holds where the animals were. They would also play Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. In the aricle Luke also said that Seagoing is more than an adventure.

"The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is this a good or a bad thing? Answering this question is quite simple, because there is only one correct answer. All students participating in an activity is an excellent thing. There are several reasons why kids should be in extracurricular activities. Kids should partake in extracurricular activities because of the social benefits, students will learn valuable life skills, and there are numerous health benefits.

Firstly, students need social skills to survive everyday life. Many kids in this day and age lack the basic social skills they need to excel in life. Joining the different extracurricular activities that the school has to offer can help with that issue. Students will make new friends and build bonds that could last for the rest of their lives. Making friends isn't always the easiest thing to do. But being with people that are interested in the same activity as the student will help. Communication is key in the world. Talking through social media or text is all kids know. Being apart of a group will force the kids to communicate verbally. Talking verbally is a struggle for many kids and it's important that they learn how to. Once students grow up they will have to talk face to face. It's imperative that the schools teach this skill or kids will struggle further in life. Another reason is that team working skills can be learned through extracurricular activities. Students will have to work together to complete tasks or solve issues. In adulthood teamwork is a necessary skill to have. Teaching kids basic social skills at an early age will benefit them in the future.

Secondly, kids will learn excellent life skills while participating in extracurricular activities. Responsibility is one of those life skills. Whether it's a club, sport or some other type of activity kids will learn how to be responsible. For example, kids will have to take on certain duties for their activity. Time management will be necessary, because kids will have to make time for everything in their life. Both of those are great examples of how kids will have to become responsible. Another great thing extracurricular activities can give students is ambition and healthy competitiveness. Both of which are great qualities to have to be a leader. Leadership skills is an important thing that kids should have. There will be captains, presidents, or mentors in almost all of extracurricular activities. Students can become a leader in their activity. Being a leader will help students learn what it's like to have power. This will also cause students to have the ability to help their fellow students. Kids are the future leaders of the world. It's important that they have the skills to be able to lead the world. Many kids are too dependent or they could be smothered by people in their life. This causes students to not know how to handle things on their own. Extracurricular activities will give kids the chance to be independent. Students will have to handle certain situations or make decisions on their own. It's important for kids to have a decent level of independence and to not be babied their whole life. Kids won't be able to take care of themselves in adulthood, because they were reliant on the adults in their childhood. Those were just a few examples of the amazing life skills kids will learn by partaking in activities.

Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit kids mentally and physically. There are many health benefits of activities. Depression is an issue that many people have to deal with. It has been said that kids have been suffering from depression a lot over the past few years. Many kids feel alone or that they have no friends. Being in an extracurricular activity can show students that they are not alone. Children will feel less lonely if they are apart of something with other people. Students can bond over their struggles and even get help. Extracurricular activities can act as a support group for many students. It doesn't have to be just loneliness or depression. Kids that have a bad home life can find comfort in the group. Also, kids can become more confident in themselves. A problem that many kids face is the lack of self confidence. This can affect their grades, friendships, and most importantly their happiness. There are many other circumstances that kids might face. But all of the kids can share their pain and find peace inside of their group. Not only can activities improve mental health they can improve physical health. Many kids don't receive the proper amount of physical activity or even sunlight they need. Most children stay inside and are glued to their devices, which can lead to health problems later in life. Extracurricular activities can help children get out of the house and do something. Sports are a great example of an activity that will get kids moving. Mental and physical health aren't always a priority to society but they should be.

The principal enforcing extracurricular activities will have many positive effects on students. Social skills, the ability to communicate, and team working skills will be a great lesson that kids will learn. Students will become more responsible, independent and have enough leadership skills to run their own business. Being in an extracurricular activity will benefit the emotional, mental, and physical health of students. All of these things are highly important to be successful and happy in life. Many kids lack some of the skills listed previously, which is why it's a great idea to enforce extracurricular activities. Kids will be happier, better people, and more prepared for the future. Who would want children to not be any of those things? The answer to that is no one. In conclusion, all students should be in an extracurricular activity because of the social benefits, kids will learn necessary skills, and there are several health benefits. ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I do not think that you should make all students perform community service it should be a optional thing. The reason it is optional is because some people just don't have the time. Take me for example i have to go home after school grab a quick bite to eat then i have to go play basketball or go to the gym. I used to even have to babysit. Other kids also have this problem that they don't have enough time to do any of this because of babysitting a lot of kids in our school have little brother and/or sisters and have to babysit after school. Witch makes it impossible to go do community service because by the time our parents get home we have to eat dinner then go do our homework and its already night time. Also it should be optional because some people just don't care about community service. Like when i say this i mean it nicely but i don't care about community service in my neighborhood all it is to me is more work and responsibilities i have to do. I would much rather hang out with my friends everyday and have a very fun athletic and social life. Then to go to community service everyday and just work. I know how bad it sucks to have community service because when i had to do 150 hours of it for court i hated it. I had to get up in the morning on my weekends and go work for hours and i get nothing out of it but some trash picked up off the ground witch wouldn't bother me even if it was there. So giving kids requirements to do community service would not be fair, but there is kids out there that for some odd reason like to do this so i think you should just have a sign up sheet and hold meetings about coming to community service on certain days to help out the community once in a while and the kids that want to help can help and the kids that have things to do and have plans to hang out with people and sleep out or have someone sleep in should not have to do it if they do not want to. I also think that if kids do sign up you can like bring them on a trip or two and have special meetings with them in school were they can get out of class like once or twice a month to just go eat like pizza or ice cream or even just to hang out and talk while using our phones and ipods. The reason i say this is because you will get more kids to sign up like the kids like me who will do it just to get out of class and socialize more because we are always finding newer and better ways to socialize and not get in trouble. Plus why not reward us for wanting to help out the community and for helping out the school and all the other people in the community. But no matter what community service should never be force on a kid for school it should only be forced on when they get in trouble with the law but i don't think even then but that will never change so it don't matter. so please do not make us all have community service just have a sign up sheet and the people who come can get special rewards and treats other students don't get.

"The Electoral College makes it so that candidates have a just as fair a chance as the other candidates. In the artical

What is the Electoral College , it says that, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A mojority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President""(1). Two hudrend seventy is over half of 538 therefore giving the candiate presidency. ""Your state's entitled allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each memebr in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators""(1). This being each state has the same number of senators and one represenative from the House. This seems pretty fair and it lines up with the Electoral College.

While it is true that the Electoral College seems unfair at the most basic level(2), the Electoral College still should not be removed because it keeps the ranks within the elections at peace. Although some may see the Electoral College as unfair, it is just about as fair as popular votes. If the Electoral College were to be abolished then Obama wouldn't have won the Election back in 2012 because the elctions would be based off of popularity and more people were against Obama and wanted a Republican, or Romney.  For example,Obama wouldn't have had as fair of a chance as he did in 2008 if the Elcetoral College would have been abolished within the next four years when he ran again. He probably would have lost in 2012 because he didn't win the popular vote and that is what the country would be going by if the were no more Electoral College. This causes people to think that the Electoral College is unfair because Obama won.

This debate is able to go either way because if winning was based on popularity then one candidate would win but the loosing candidates supporters blaim it on the Electoral College, but on the other hand, if Electoral Colleges were banned, then the another candicate would win and the loosing candidates supporters would blame it on elections being based on popularity vote. It is unfair in the loosing team's side so in other words elections are all unfair. For example, ""Back in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legistlature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote would have not actually gone to Kennedy.)(2)."" This shows that people where desperate for wins and were against popular vote.                  ",0
"Bycicles. Walking. Public buses. All three are alternatives to driving a car to arrive at places that you need to go. Some believe that having an automobile is essential to everyday life. Others may say that cars are unnecessary and a pollutants in our society. There are many advantages of limited car usage.

Limiting the use of cars could help reduce the amount of pollutantss in our environment. In Source two, it states, ""Cold nights and warm air caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission."" This tells us that car emissions are being caught in the air due to the weather, causing a layer of smog to settle over congested cities. By limiting the use of automobiles, the layer of smog was able to vanish, but if we were able to limit cars permanently, then we would not have to worry about it in the first place. In Source four, it tells us that, ""If the pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" This proves that car emissions are harmful to the environment and that future generations are at risk because of the pollution already in the air. Also, the statement shows that Americans are very dependant on transportation, but are unwilling to try a different method such as walking and biking. By reducing the number of cars on the road, our environment would be helped tremendously.

Having to worry about driving a car may produce more stress in a persons life. In Source three, it says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This tells us that riding in an automobile, while the roads are very crowded, causes people to worry about whether or not they are going to be in an accident. Also, it has been proven that exercise helps to lower stress, and by riding a bike instead of driving a car, stress may be lowered by simply using your resources to get where you need to go. In Source one, it tells us, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now. Heidrun Walter, mother of two."" This proves that people are worried about their car and if it might break down, or something worse. Something can always go wrong with a car, whether it be trouble with the engine or you accidently locked your keys inside, and it becomes very expensive when you have to fix a small blunder. By limiting car ownership, less people have to worry about their automobile.

A great alternative to owning a car is public transportation. In Source four it explains, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" By uses others means of transportation, it makes it very convenient for kids to meet up with their friends for a while, and still get to where they need to go. Also, public transportation is much cheaper than buying a car and gas for it, and it helps reduce the number of cars on the road. In Source two, it tells us that ""Public transit was free of charge for Friday to Monday."" By taking the bus that the government provided people received free transportation, allowing them to not have to worry about parking, gas prices, or potential accidents. They could travel wherever they needed to go on a very convinient mode of transportation for no cost to them. Public transportation, or carpooling, is an amazing way to lower the number of cars on the road, while still providing people with a way to be driven to the destination they need to get to.

Automobiles, the plugs to the sinks of the streets of the world, seem to clog up the efficient system of transportion. Parents, workers, and athletic kids alike are affected by the large number of cars on the road. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there would be a direct impact on our environment, emotions, and future generations.",0
"Online schooling has become an increasingly popular option in recent times, and it is important to assess its pros and cons in relation to traditional in-person schooling. On the positive side, the advantages of online schooling include flexibility and convenience that allows students to work at their own pace, as well as access to resources online. However, there are some notable drawbacks too, such as lacking face-to-face interaction with peers or teachers, which is essential for collaborating and gaining insight from instructors.

There are many ways students can receive help while taking online classes. Many teachers offer additional tutorials or written feedback to help students understand the material better. Schools typically have online resources such as discussion forums or virtual conferences that allow students to ask questions and stay in touch with their teachers and classmates. However, there are some potential problems that students may experience with online classes. For example, students may struggle to understand the material and feel lack of motivation and commitment towards it, and may forget assignments due to lack of reminders.

When it comes to whether or not online schooling should be offered, there are both arguments in favor and against. Proponents of online schooling argue that it offers students flexibility and access to resources that in-person classes cannot. Critics, on the other hand, contend that online schooling cannot replace in-person classes, as it leaves out crucial aspects of student development such as collaboration and interpersonal communication. Ultimately, in order to decide whether online schooling is beneficial or detrimental, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each form of learning.",1
"While attending a public/traditional school have very good benefits, some people don't do well in regular school enviornments. Having the option to take classes from home has bnefits that apeal to to people that dont learn well under normal learning circumstances.

If your someone that works or have other duties that get in the way of going to school, online classes gives you that flexability to learn from your home and so start and finish day-to-day lessons. Online classes also aliviates some the stress of balancing classes. Things like school events wather and days off won't effect your learning progression which makes finishing classes alot easier which gives you more time for other activities.

While online classes have great benefits there are some downsides. Most of the work is on you to comprehend, complete, and turn in on time. You also will be Isolated from other people and expiriences you can only have in a regular school. But while these are true they are easy to overcome if you are focused and determined.

Students all over the U.S. fail to do well in school because the types of benefits traditional school gives do not benefit the student(s) in the areas needed and in the the way that insures the most productive learning experience. Having alternative ways to gain accses to classes gives people that dont have the time to commute to a school a way to consistenly learn at there own pace.",0
"The Face on Mars

""The Face on Mars"" is a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head,"" as NASA stated in 1976.

Many know that it is just a natural landform like on earth, but some believe that the Face was created by aliens.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform because we have landforms like it here on earth, photographic evidence reveals a natural landform, and there is no evidence that the Face was built by life outside of earth.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform, just like we have on earth.

Jim Garvin, who is the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, knows that the Face is just another landform.

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" he said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

This is just one piece of evidence that the Face cannot be anything more than a natural landform--because it has many characteristics of a landform here on earth.

A second reason that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform is because of the images taken in 2001 by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

Twenty five years after its first photographs, clearer, higher resolution photos of Face came from MGS.

From the 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 photograph versus the 1.56 meters per pixel in the 2001 photograph, there is clearly enough evidence that the Face on Mars is just a natural land formation similar to a mesa.

The rises and dips in the landform just resemble the shape of eyes, nose, and mouth of a human face and nothing more, but after seen more clearly, cracks and crevaces in the land prove that the Face is just a natural landform.

Those who believe that the Face on Mars was built by aliens have nothing to base their beliefs on other than the fact that the landform resembles a face.

No evidence whatsoever suggests that the Face was built by supernatural life.

On the other hand, photos--and common sense itself--prove that the landform is just another landform like we have on earth.

The passage itself proves the authenticity of the landform.

It says that ""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.

There was no alien monument at all,"" proving that the Face is only a landform.

To conclude, no evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is anything more than a natural landform.

The Face has characteristics of a landform on earth, and images of it from 2001 reveal only a landform.

On top of that, those who believe that alien activity is responsible for the creation of the Face have little to no information to base their beliefs on.

In the end, though, we know that the little landform called the Face of Mars is just one of our universe's great mysteries.",0
" It's important to have a balance in life, and after school homework clubs can often disrupt that balance. While it may seem like a good idea to have extra time to work on homework, the benefits of spending time with family and pursuing hobbies cannot be overstated. In this essay, I will argue that after school homework clubs should not be offered to students.

Firstly, students should have the opportunity to spend time with their families. After school clubs can often conflict with family time, as parents may have plans to spend time with their children outside of school. For example, imagine a student who wants to go out to dinner with their family, but they are in an after school club that runs until late in the evening. They may miss out on this opportunity to spend time with their loved ones, which can have a negative impact on their relationships.

Secondly, after school homework clubs can interfere with students' ability to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. If a student is in an after school club and also involved in a sport, they may find themselves struggling to balance both commitments. For instance, a student who plays basketball may have to attend an after school club for English class, which could cause them to be late for their basketball practice. This could lead to them being kicked off the team, as in the example of Generic_Name.

Lastly, after school homework clubs can take away from students' time to pursue hobbies and interests outside of school. If a student is passionate about video games, for example, they may find that an after school club takes up too much of their time and prevents them from playing during the week. This could lead to them missing out on the social aspects of gaming, such as streaming and interacting with their followers.

In conclusion, after school homework clubs can be detrimental to students' lives. They can disrupt family time, interfere with sports and other extracurricular activities, and take away from time to pursue hobbies. It is important for schools to consider alternative ways to help students with their homework, such as providing online resources or setting up study groups. By doing so, students can have a better work-life balance and pursue their interests and passions outside of school.",1
"Students have the option to attend classes from home that some schools offer them. It's important for students to get a good education whether they get it from attending to school or online. Schools must focus on some ways students can be benefited from learning. Schools should not offer students options to attend classes from home because students will not take their education seriously, they will be distracted from many things, and they will not learn efficiently.

Many students don't take their lives seriously, especially their education. This school option will make students not to complete their tasks on time. Because they will not have an adult telling them that they need to complete, they will take their education less serious. They will not see education as an important thing. It's likely that they would be slacking around at home, because teachers will not be there to tell them what to do.

There are many things students can be distracted from. Any device, for example, can be a distraction for students. A phone can be a problem for them. It's a distraction that can stop them from learning. There are high chances students would be texting with someone and using social media when taking classes online. They would also be going out too much, leading them to forget that they have classes to take online. At home, they would feel tired and bored because they won't even have any social interaction. They would go out more often and would it would lead them to be distracted every time they go out.

Education is important, but taking classes online will not make students to learn efficiently. They need teachers to guide and tell them what to do. If they don't have a teacher to tell them what to do or how to do it, they will end up confused, not knowing what to do next. They will not be learning anything because they will not understand what they're doing. Their knowledge will decrease due to the lack of learning.

Although some people may say that attending classes at home is good, they are not correct. Taking classes online does not benefit students from learning. In fact, it makes them less productive. They will not have idea of what is going on. Attending classes online is not the best way for students to learn.     ",0
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so like, I know some schools are starting to offer three year high school programs instead of the traditional four year ones. And, like, I can see why some people might think that's a good idea. But, honestly, I think four year programs are way better. Here's why:

First of all, four year programs give you more time to explore your interests. In three years, you're basically just trying to cram in all the basics and maybe a few electives. But with four years, you have time to take more classes in different subjects and figure out what you really want to do with your life. Plus, you get to take more advanced classes and learn more stuff. Like, I know someone who took a three year program and they were still trying to figure out what they wanted to do after high school. But if they had had four years, they could have taken more classes and maybe even gotten an internship or something.

Another thing is, four year programs give you more time to make friends and be part of the school community. In three years, you're basically just trying to survive and get through the work. But with four years, you have time to join clubs and sports and stuff, and make real connections with people. And, like, you get to be part of the school culture for longer, so you feel more like you belong.

And, like, let's be real, four year programs are just more traditional. I mean, high school is supposed to be four years, right? It's what everyone expects. So if you do three years, it's like you're bucking the system or something. Plus, four year programs are just more well-rounded. You get to take classes in art and music and stuff, and learn more about the world.

So, yeah, three year programs might be more convenient or whatever, but in my opinion, four year programs are way better. They give you more time to figure out who you are and what you want to do, and they let you be part of the school community for longer. And, like, they're just more traditional and stuff. So, yeah, I'm definitely going to try to do four years",1
"Dear Principal,

To whom it may concern, some of the kids in our school think that community service is a waste of time and think it takes time away for them to do things they want to do.

I think students should require to perform community service because it would be a great learner quality and it makes the community a better place to live.

If nobody did community service then the town would have trash and all kinds of junk around it.

I think that community service would be great for example , cleaning up a grave yard would be nice for the families relatives that died.

Maybe if you just picked up trash or put new flags in for the veterans who have died in the past year.

When people do community service it makes a big difference to people and the society. Also, if only a little group performed this task then there would not be a lot accomplished and everyone wouldn't `t appreciate as much as the people who did it.

I think you should require all kids to do community service because it would be a great thing to learn about and appreciate for most of your life.

Hopefully you understand what I am trying to say.

Also, it will look good on college applications if they hear that you like to take your time in helping your community.

Anything can be community service even if its just helping shovel an older persons driveway or cutting your own front lawn.

It doesn't have to be cleaning up trash.

Also, I think that you should make a club or something so that more people will be more interested in doing community service.

Thank you for your time!!!!!      ",0

I have enjoyed researching how art pieces are sold and the value that they can currently bring in the market. But I understand that creating art is not always easy. It requires a lot of patience and practice, and even then mistakes may be encountered. However, I have found that with enough perseverance, these mistakes can transform into successes.

"Dear Principal,

I think that it should be a grade C average to be in sports or other activities. Most student try their hardest just to get a C average to be barely passing to play in sports. Also most students can't stay focus on what they are learning and have to get help from one of their classmates witch they don't get the full help that the teacher gave the class. One reason why they wouldn't get the full understanding is because the student that he or she gets the help from then they may not be able to tell her or him what the teacher taught the classmates a easier way on how to do the work.

For example, for math, the teacher may be teaching them on how to set up proportions and one or two students aren't paying attention and when the teacher gives them their assignment he or she don't understand on how to do the proportions because they weren't paying attention. So if they go ask a classmate that did pay attention they don't show him or her on how to set it up just how to do the work. And that's why i think that the student should get a grade C average instead of a grade B average.

Also they may want to try harder to get a grade B average to improve their grades so that they don't have to worry about failing or barely passing. And its better to know that your doing good in a class instead of knowing that your barely passing in a class.

Students may love the activity or sport that he or she is in, and if their failing then they may be sad that they can't play in the game or participate to the activity that they are in. They would really like it if they could play in the sport that they are in or participate in the activity that he or she is in.

Sincerely,

"Dear Principle,

The United States youths' job is to go to school and get educated for the future. Although you can hardly call that a job, it would be better to call it a privilege a privilege. In this country the majority of citizen children do not have to go to working job like adults, their sole job do their work from their job at school. All the children have to do is learn what the teacher says and do the assignments the teacher says. Easy as pie. So when kids are barely passing on a C average there is not an excuse.

They are not doing their job. If they can't do what they are supposed to at the level that is expected, why should they take on more responsibility. It simply does not make sense. If your barely sliding by every day, how much use will you be on the sports field if your barely sliding by on there as well. Personally i get straight A' s and it will be a rare site to see me with a B grade at all. My advice to those who do get C average and make some idiotic excuse is do your work. That is all i simply do. Do your work then, anything else that needs tending comes second. Fun which is not needed is the last and least of your priorities. No if' s, and' s, or but' s, about it as my mother would say. If you get a grade C average you easily have room for improvement so its best that you do improve. It won't be to hard, and you'll benefit from improving your grades. If you do good in school you'll do good on the sports field because you have your priorities straight and you aren't constantly on the border line between flunking your grade or passing. Not only will improving your grades for sports help you play sports, but it'll help your overall GPA and help you learn better and/or more By improving and keeping your grades good it'll become a good habit that will hopefully follow you for the rest of your life, not only for sports.",0
"Conserving energy is one of the most important elements of sustainability and resource conservation. It is important to conserve energy both financially and ecologically — environmentally-friendly energy conservation can lead to economic and environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money on energy bills. Additionally, conserving energy can help to reduce reliance on natural resources like paper, such as in an academic setting. Teachers can encourage students to move away from traditional paper-based learning activities and use digital applications instead. There are also many ways individuals can help conserve energy in everyday life, such as turning off lights when leaving a room, washing clothes in cold water, buying products with the Energy Star label, and recycling. By conserving energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint, help protect the environment, and make significant cost savings.",1
"Studying Venus has the good and the bad. You find out so much about your planet and others. Like whybdonthey call Venus an ""Evening Star"" when its actually a planet. With Venus being provern a very challenging place to examine, ist hard to find out more abiut it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite that dangers.

One of the big dangers studying Venus is the temperature. Venus is the hottes planet in our solar system. The planets temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than then on our planet. The conditions are way more extreme then what we've encounter on Earth. In addition to the heat there's erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

We could be living on Venus. Venus has the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus used to be covered with oceans that could've supported various forms of life. Even today Venus has rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is an opttion for a planetary visit.

There are solutions for the temperature. NASA's solution is to let scientist float above the fray. A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case its a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800 degree surface. The vehicle would be thirty-plus miles above the surface. Solar power would be plentful anc radiation would not exceed Earth levels, survivable but not easy conditions.

Trying to meet the challenge by Venus has value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us to many intimidating endeavors. With the dangers studing Venus, helps us incase we need to move to another planet. Studying Venus is dangerous but, it has its perks.     ",0
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens. That should stay remain the same they should not be any change to the Electoral College system.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorals. When the electors have a meeting thats when they are able to for the President, Vice President that is running for office. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, majority of 270 electoral vote, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Each candidate that is running in the election has their own group of electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The voters help choose their state's electorals when they voted for the President, when they vote for the candidate they are actually votin for the candidate's electors. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the efforts the candidate put to win the election like the campagin.

The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner- take-all that awards all the electors to the winning presidental candidate. After the presidental election the state governor will prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" that which list all the of the candidates that ran for office, along with the names for their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winner of the presidental candidate of your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the offical records of presidential election.                      ",0
"The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice; instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote.

The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by Gallup in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an up-to-date election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.

Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.

Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.

In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.            ",0
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" David Goldberg. Automobiles have been a major impact on today's technology. The creation of the car was a huge turning point in history. Even though this machine has been such an amazing creation, it still causes a lot of damage in society. Cars affect both the environment and humans. The limit of car usage would be great because then the amount of pollution would decrease, less traffic would occur, and it makes way for alternative transportation opportunities.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. The reduction of cars can lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities are choking due to the increase number of emissions. Paris had hit nearrecord pollution which lead to an enforced ban of partial driving to clear the air of the global city. according to Robert Duffer, Paris typically has more smog than other European capital. In Bogota, Colombia there is a day called Day Without Cars, there they only let buses and taxis drive around and their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If anybody goes against this, they would have to pay 25. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. This day became really big in Colombia and improved their cities overall look.

Furthermore, the limitation of car usage would decrease the amount of traffic. Traffic is an ongoing issue in everyday life. People arrive late to work or school or wherever they need to go due to traffic or an accident. During the Day Without Cars in Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses, leaving the city devoid of traffic jams. Traffic jams are usually stressful so if that gets reduced with the limitation of car usage, then stress levels get reduced as well, causing mentally healthier people. Traffic jams also occur due to accidents. Car accidents are one of the many reasons why people end up in hospitals, get sued, get hurt, or loose money. With the limitation of car usage, all these issues will be resolved.

Moreover, new alternative transportation vehicles can come into play with the reduction on car usage. There is a plan where they want suburbs to play a much larger role in a new sixyear federal transportation bill to be approved. Also, during the Day Without Cars, the goal is to promote alternative transportation. Lately, new transportation vehicles have been discovered and created. Some include, a flying car, an elevated train that gets you from point A to point B in seconds, and new hybrid cars. Technology keeps progressing every single day. Today people may be driving their normal SUVs but by tomorrow, they could be drivng the new highspeed flying Ferrari. People are always keeping in mind while creating these machines about how it will affect the community and the consumers. Since it is obvious that the environment isn't as healthy as it was before, they must make sure that these machines limit pollution and emissions that affect the world negatively.

Overall, the limit of car usage would be a good thing. As time goes on people may not even need cars anymore to move from place to place. If everyone works together to solve these issues then the world would become a much better place. The final goal is to get rid of all the bad emissions and issues and just stick to what is best for the environment. When the environment is healthy, the humans are healthy.",0

"Dear Sentator,

My associates and I, have thought long and hard that we should have the Electoral College removed. Why? The Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and boring. We feel as if we should spice things up and be able to decide and presidents wit a majority vote rule. I know what your saying, "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no cnandidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" With that I want to include that, if a state were to have it's own vote within the state and turn that into a vote then use that as a majority rule everything would be much easier. For Instance, in florida if lets say 72% vote President Obama, then that would be a vote for obama from florida and with the other 49 states doing the same thing then we have a easy way of using the majority rule.

Bob Dole was right we should abolish the electoral college. Why should we vote for someone who half the time picks the president you dont want. There are many reasons why we should ban the electoral college we dont nessesarily have use the majority rules method, but any other idea besides the electoral college i would go with any day. Why? Would you want to keep the electoral college? Why? Do you think this is helping america, its not really doing us harm, but why?

I see you might argue that the electoral college is widely regarded an an anachronism, a non-democratic method of diciding on a president. Is needs to be overruled by another method or even the majority rule. Considering you tried to i assume balance powers by making us vote for electors, who actually they get to vote for the president. You also might say their are five reasons you might want to keep the elctoral college. The certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, avoid run-off elections.

And with all that said. I want just want you to think of other possibilities to use to replace Electoral College. I assur you that if the it is removed and you use the majority rule something similar you can decide a president much faster.    ",0
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author supports the idea of finding a way to explore and study Venus despite the challenges that would need to be overcome. The author supports this idea very well by noting and explaining possible solutions and explaining how succeeding can be scientifically productive.

In paragraph 3, the author explains the many factors that makes Venus an inhospitable planet and then explains the scientific value of being able to explore it in paragraph 4. This is done to show the extent of the challenges and the rewards of exploring Venus and how the scientific value would be worth overcoming the challenges.

On paragraph 5, the author then explains an idea from NASA on how exploring Venus can be possibly done. The author also explains possible technologies that can be used in Venus's harsh conditions on paragraph 7. Paragraphs 5 and 7 are used support the idea further by giving possible solutions explaining how exploring Venus can be potentially done sometime in the future.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea of exploring Venus very well by explaining the benefits of doing so and giving evidence that exploring Venus can be eventually possible in the future.         ",0
"Dear Senator...

The electoral college has recently been a very controversial topic in the world of politics. Many believe that it's a significant system, that's why the Founding Fathers created it, while others argue that it doesn't necessarily work as well. The Electoral College is a process in which there is an agreement between the president's election by a vote in Congress and the president's  election by a popular vote made by the citizens. There should be a change in the system into changing election by a popular vote since the Electoral College is not only an outdated system, but it gives the citizens no control over who Congress will be picking.

To start off, the process of the Electoral College should be changed since it's an outdated system. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" it says ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachroism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" Even the article that seems to be favoring the electoral college introduced it as so. It can be seen that it is a process that has been around since America itself, but America has constantly been changing and innovating and it needs a more flexible system to cast the votes. In ""What is the Electoral College""? it states that ""THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS QA COMPROMISE"" HENCE THIS IS STATING THAT THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED A LONG TIME AGO AND IT NEEDS SOME CHANGES.

TO CONTINUE, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED SINCE IT DOESN'T GIVE THE CITIZENS ALOT OF CONTROL AS TO WHO THE CONGRESS WILL BE PICKING. IN ""THE INDEFENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, IT SAYS THAT 'THE SINGLE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE DISASTER FACTOR."" WHAT THIS IS, IS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE NO CONTROL WHOM THE ELECTORS VOTE FOR. AS WELL, IN THE SAME ARTICLE, IT STATES THAT ""AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS UNFAIR TO VOTERS. BECAUSE OF THE WINNER TAKE ALL SYSTEM IN EACH STATE, CANDIDATES DON'T SPEND TIME IN STATES THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NO CHNACE OF WINNING.'' WHAT ALL THIS SAYS IS THAT, THE VOTERS HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS PICKING, AND IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO ANOTHER SYSTEM.

TO CONCLUDE, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED TO A NEW SYSETM WHICH IS FAIR AND MORE TRUSTFUL TO THE VOTERS. NOT ONLY IS THE SYSTEM OUTDADE, BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE VOTERS ALOT OF CONTROL. A NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE INTRODUCED. ALTHOUGH MANY AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE CHANGED, ALSO SOME BELIEVE IT SHOULD STAY HOW IT IS. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED, SO THIS WAY, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE VOICE, NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT.    ",0
"Many people across the country would believe that having an Electoral College is good idea. Well, I believe that it is not a good idea to continue having an Electoral College to chose our president because the people deserve to have their votes count. In the process of having an Electoral College the popular votes do not count, only the slate of electors can vote for the candidate. That's not even the worst part to begin with.

In source 2, it says that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half the amount of voters in the country! It even states ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" meaning that sometimes the electors would not always have the same idea in mind as the people have. To me that is a real bummer especially for the people in the state with those kinds of electors.

Furthermore, the Electoral college may have a few benefits as it states in source 3. Fore example, it says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" meaning that barely anyone would vote in the state. But that is usually a rare occasion and is easily avoided in every state. As individuals we would usually not avoid coming to vote in an election for certain positions especially when it comes to a president.

Sometimes people would even let the Electoral College vote for them without the people knowing who they voted for. The Electoral College is supposed to represent their state towards a candidate but what if the state rarely has any electors to be represented or doesn't have any at all? That is why it is up to the people to make their own decision in who they want to vote for and hopefully their vote counts. The Electorial College may be recomended to represent their state but they can never represent every individual's vote because not all people have the same candidate in mind and the Electorial College can only vote for one candidate.

Overall, I think the Electoral College should be abolished in every way. It is the people's vote that should count not the electors. Some people may disagree but I still believe the Electorial College is not good for us. It is not truely fair to have the majority of popular votes on one candidate and still that candidate does not win due the Electoral College. So I can most certainly agree with what previous people and groups have said before such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerance, and the AFLCIO.... To get rid of the Electoral College.",0
"""The challenge of studying Venus"" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. Venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many reasons why it would be so difficult. For some reason though he doesnt really list any benefits to exploring Venus.

Throughout the whole story the author is just making Venus sound like a horrible place. In the article he writes "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to.

Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, "" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. The author writes "" on the planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit."" You cant even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,"" Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans."" All those oceans that may have been their are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth?

In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.",0
"Many times we as humans study things that have been studied hundreds of times. Amost like we think the we might be able to prove the findings wrong or something. Why don't we study things that no has ever studied before? Why don't we try to strive for more. The only reason why Pluto is not a planet no longer is cause we know there is more planets beyond.

Venus is one of the things that we really have never studied. Even though the odds are greatly against humans with a extremely hot 800 degree surface, and much more we should try to create a space craft that could reach and survive the elements. Spend time in the lab, andtry to find a new material that could with stand the elements.

We had flew to the moon hundreds of times, and circled the sun many times to. Expand the possiblities, and raise the bar on what the human raise can do. Challlenge ourselves, and expand dreams and knowledge. Make another planet possible if we ever do need to leave planet Earth!    ",0
"Dear Mr. Senator,

As you are most likely aware, the Electoral College is a long-debated, controversial process. I believe that it is in the best interest for the citizens of America that the Electoral College be abolished. Under the Electoral College system, voters do not vote for the president but rather for a slate of electors who will vote for the president. Voters cannot control who the electors vote for and it is not unheard of that any given elector may be ""faithless"" and refuse to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast their deciding vote for whomever they want. The people of the United States of America are speaking up. According to a

Gallup poll conducted shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency in 2000, over 60%

-a majority- of voters prefer to have a direct election over an election through the Electoral College.

One may argue that the infamous 2000

Bush Vs. Kerry election is rare, but nevertheless, it happened, are we going to wait until it happens again to make a change? We take pride in being a democracy, we take pride in living in such a place that was created by the people and for the people , but is the power really in the hands of the people? The power may be in the hands of the people, but only the 538 people who belong to the Electoral College. The system in place is flawed and the outcome can be manipulted to favor one political party over the other. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana nearly succesfully replaced the Democratic electors with different electors who would decieve the voters and then oppose Kennedy when voting.

Another con of The Electoral College is a dilemma that has to do with the number of electoral votes given to each state. The Electoral College works in the same way that The House of Representatives does. The number of electors alloted to each state is subjective to the population number of that state. Take a state such as California for example. California is alloted 55 electors. States such as South Dakota and Alaska cant compete with the great power coming from the larger states. In the Congress, the Senate was created to balance it out, but there is nothing in place to balance the importance between large (high density)  states and small (low density) states. Even more worrying is the situation in which there is a tie. In the case of a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the House of Representatives, where state delegations would then have the deciding vote.

The Electoral College is outdated, unfair and impractical. The citizens of The

United States are more than capable of making descisions for themselves and do not need electors to make it for them. It is a non-democratic method of selecting a president and should be abolished.

Thank You.                                                                 ",0
"Sure, here's my essay on the idea that we can choose our character traits:

Hey there, teacher! 

So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole ""character traits"" thing, and I reckon it's kinda like, totally up to us to decide what kind of person we want to be. Like, we can choose to be quiet and reserved, or social and outgoing. And don't even get me started on being over oneself – that's like, totally a thing we can work on, right?

I mean, think about it. Have you ever met someone who's just super confident and outgoing, and you're like, ""Wow, they're just so... them""? And then you realize, wait a minute, they're not just naturally like that – they've worked on it! They've practiced being more outgoing and confident, and it's like, totally paid off.

Take my friend Emily, for example. She's always been super shy and introverted, but she's been working on being more outgoing and confident. She's started joining more clubs and groups, and now she's like, totally the life of the party. It's like, who is this person?!  But seriously, it's like she's become a totally different person, and it's all because she decided to work on her character traits.

And it's not just about being outgoing or confident, either. We can choose to be more patient, or more empathetic, or more responsible. Like, I know this one kid who's always getting into trouble because he's not very responsible, but he's been working on it, and now he's like, totally on top of his schoolwork and stuff. It's like, wow, how did he turn into a responsible person?!  But seriously, it's like he's made a conscious effort to change, and it's totally paid off.

So, in conclusion, I reckon we can totally choose our character traits. It's like, we have the power to decide who we want to be, and it's up",1
Vote for me the other guy whats to take all your money no vote for me he fail english in high school thats al you hear when its voteing time. they put them all over  like  the malls sides of roads. Its all stupid they saying things to make eachother look bad but that the end of the day no one is perfect. So what he did in his passed and in high school is just pointless to bring up. As teens and kids we do stuoid stuff but we do grow up so why bring it back up to make you feel better about your self. this is what i really dont get we the people are suppost to vote to see who will be leading us for the next four years but we really are not. We all vote but then if the electoral college chocies some one else that who it is so what is the point in us votin. If even when we the people vote for this person and he wins with us and yall want the other guy he wins thats not fair to him or us. It should be popular votes take all. did you know that when you vote for your canidate you are actally voting for your candidates electors. Then our governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment they all so decllare the winning presidential candidate. I think its all just not worth it all that work for what if we could just vote on who we want and the person that gets the most votes wins.  I dont understnd why this have to have all that other stuff that is not needed. They say the electoral college restpres some of the weight in the political balance. They have 538 electors whats the point if we the people could just vote why i really dont understand whats the need for them the person with most votes wins i dont see why all that other stuff is nesseasy. I know you people probley think im crazy but i dont care it just dont seem to me like there is apoint for all of that this is just how i see it in y point of veiw    ,0
"Mars has many landforms, but there is a particular one that is peculiar. The landfrom is known as The Face. The Face was spotted by a space surveyor in 1976 and has been a mystery to the world ever since. Some people say that this landform was made by alien life on Mars, but with facts from NASA and other sources you could see that those people are wrong.

The Face has had many theories made up about how it was made and if it is even real. One of these theories is about how or who created it. This theory is about how NASA is hiding the fact that the face was made by some type of alien lifeform, which logically makes no sense at all. Finding life on another planet would bring in a gargantuan amount of money for NASA so it would seem completely illminded to hide something like this from the people. NASA can only wish they knew about an alien lifeform.

With this new discovery people and scientists demanded for more proof on how it was made. Throughout the knowing of this landform three pictures were taken of it. The first of pictures was in 1976 when they first found it and camera quality was not very good. With not a clear image, and the need for answers, NASA sought out for another picture and got one during a cloudy winter day in 1988. This picture did come out clearer than the other but still was not perfect for scientist and people to be one-hundred percent sure how it was made. So the wait began to get another picture. Finally in two-thousand-one NASA used a new, high-resolution, three-dimensional camera to take an outstanding clear photo of what they concluded to be a mesa, common in the American West, just with the physical pheatures of a human face.

In conclusion this outstanding land form on Mars had the world stuck asking this question, ""Is there alien life on mars?"" The Face was a mystery to science for almost thirty years only to be proven to be just another landform on Mars. To conclude, this landform is nothing more than a naturally occuring lava dome. ",0
" As a person who wants to achieve greatness, I believe that it is important to exhibit your hobbies and be recognized for your own work. In order to be successful, you must be kind and do your work consistently. If you cannot do it, then you must do it because it is the key to entering the next level.

When we want something, we often ask for our success and strive for it. If you want to succeed, you must be the person that you always want to be. Along the way, you will encounter many obstacles that will not give you the next step, but if you do the biggest thing, many people will look up to you and say that you can do it too. I see many people who are one of the reasons why they are here.

If I do my work, I will be one of the people that others will always want. When I resolve my life, I think I will be more than just helping others on what they need and want. I don't want to graduate because I feel that school is not for me, I am wasting my time. I want to do what I want to do, and with that, I will be happy and help one nation.

I cannot do whatever I want to pass my life to others. To be myself, I need to create many things that will help me in my continuous life, and others can join when they ever want. In my lifetime, the things are as I didn't inspect because I want to be one of the people that others always want and take a little rest on the things I even do.

In conclusion, if I want to do many other things, I need to make many other decisions.",1

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I strongly agree with you. Cell phones are something that are very important to have during school. If cell phones are allowed during lunch periods and other free times it would be a good way for student to plan out homework assignments, students would be able to use them during emergency situations, and it would help students learn responsibility.

Many students have a problem with being unorganised. They never want to use their agendas or plan out any type of homework assignments. If students were allowed to use their cell phones, they would be more likely to plan out assignments on their phones. Every phone has a notepad tool wear they can write reminders. Students would feel cool writing down assignments on their phones, and would do it a lot more often. This will help students to stay on top of things.

Also, cell phones can help during emergency situations. Many parents like their children to have a phone with them at all times incase of an emergency. This would not only satisfy students by allowing them to have cell phones, but also their parents because of this reason. Even though they do have phones in the office, some things students would rather say in private. This way they could go to the bathroom to tell their parents.

Lastly, it would teach students responsibility. Keeping up with a cell phone requires a lot of work. Students will have to become more responsible to keep up with their phones at all times. Responsibility is a very important quality to have; this is an excellent way to teach it.

As I have made perfectly clear, I think allowing cell phones is a great change to make to our school. Students, teachers, and even parents will all appreciate it. Please think about everything I have said when you decide to change the cell phone policy or not.

Sincerely,

"Do you think that there are advantages to limiting car usage? Yes, I do think that there are advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution. There are many advantages of having limited car usage. This includes many different transportations and because of car culture.

To begin with, there are advantages to limited car usage because of pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog, the smog rivale Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gas. Diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines. Paris has more smog than other European capitals.

To continue, there are advantages to limited car usage because of many different acts of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia a program is set to spread to other countries. It was called a ""Car Free"" day which meant that you could not use your car for a whole day. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the  streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

Furthermore, there are advantages to limited car usage because of Car Culture. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions is to shift in American behavior. Research studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The United States has long been one of the world's prime car cultures. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" says Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation

Research Institute. The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.

In conclusion, there are many different advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution, many different acts of transportation, and because of Car Culture.               ",0
"Many people think texting and driving is a good idea because they think they can multitask. They believe they are above the law and won't get caught. But they don't understand the effects that is causes. There are other people who think texting and driving is a complete no go. I agree with the people who dislike it. There are many reasons why you shouldn't text and drive. To the punishment in the eyes of the law to death.

A lot of individuals have lost their life due to using an electronic while operating a vehicle. In 2015 about 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving drivers whom were distracted. In a yearly basis there are 1.6 million car crashes involving texting and driving. It is also known it is 6 times more likely to cause an accident than a drunk driver. Noting the fact that being on a cellphone while driving equals to having a alcohol level of 0.8.

The justice system comes into this subject because of what punishment would the person receive. Tickets could range from $20 - $500, depending on the state. It could result into a misdemeanor charge. If there is a incident that eventually leads to injury or death to another driver, it could lead to jail/prison time. In Georgia if you are pulled over for this ticket start at $50. It will only increase by 50 each time. It could also lead to getting points on your license as well.

Before you get a ticket for texting and driving do these following things so you wont be temped to text or call someone. Put your phone out of reach. This will prevent you from grabbing it. Download apps that block incoming calls/text. With this app the only tie it will let you text or call back is when you are stopped and parked. If you need to use your phone for directions, invest in a cellphone dash mount. Following these simple things could save your life and possibly others.

Stopping texting and driving is a goal in todays generation. It is also known that texting and driving will never be eliminated. But hopefully a majority of people stop there will be a decrease of accidents. Hopefully the number of fatalities will also go down, causing less people being in jail for possibly injuring someone. By putting phones out of reach or by buying a dashboard mount.    ",0
"Generic_Name is an intelligent girl who really enjoys learning, however, going to school is not something she looks forward to. When PROPER_NAME is at school, she is a victim of bullying and it distracts her from her assignments in the classroom. Considering her situation, Generic_Name's parents decided to remove her from the toxic environment of her current school, and enroll her into online courses she can take from home. Many students are in the same situation as Generic_Name, and find going to school hard because of fear of the way their peers treat them. Although public schools provide the social aspect of student's lives, and allow them to communicate and interact with one another, many students would benefit from distance learning because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus.

As many people know, bullying is a huge problem plaguing schools all over. It takes place in schools everyday ,and many times goes unnoticed by teachers and staff due to the fact of students concealing their bullying tactics from authority, and making their victim stay silent in fear of being treated worse. These situations make it extremely hard for students to focus in class and complete their work. Bullying also makes students afraid to even go to school, which can cause them to skip and fall behind. Distance school however, gives students the opportunity to work from home, taking online classes or using video conferences to learn material. It helps the many students who experience bullying by eliminating the problem and creating a safe space for learning and creativity to take place.

Secondly, not all students work at the same pace. Many different factors contribute to the way students receive information and the speed at which they complete assignments. Some students just naturally work faster and online classes would allow them to complete school at a quicker pace. Then, there are also the students who work at a much slower pace, and need extra time to process and comprehend information without feeling rushed by their peers. Also, students who are heavy in sports, or already working jobs are often overwhelmed, and online schooling would allow them to create their own schedule based around their activities, while still staying on track and not falling behind. Whatever the situation, the option for students to take part in online school allows them to work at their own individual pace and tailor their curriculum accordingly.

Lastly, public schools are usually not the most ideal learning environments. Disruptions are frequent and they make it hard for some students to actually be able to focus and complete assignments on time. Also, behavioral problems and fights are common in public schools, and make many students uncomfortable. Furthermore, public schools often lack healthy learning environments and make focusing especially hard for students who have specific learning needs or already have a hard time concentrating. Taking classes in the privacy, and comfort of ones home is a good solution for certain students who struggle with focusing, because the environment is familiar and essentially better suited for learning.

In conclusion, many students would benefit from distance school because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus. If more schools offered these programs, bullying rates would decrease, students would have better success in learning, and students would have more excitement when it comes to school instead of stress. All in all, more schools should consider offering online courses to accommodate students, and make school a better, safer, and more successful place for all.         ",0
"When you ask for advise, what do you do? You don't just ask a single person, you ask multiple. This can be helpful when needing a answer you understand, an answer without bias and an answer that is correct.

When you ask for help, you need an answer that you understand. If you don't understand the answer to a problem, you don't have an actual answer. If you talk to multiple people, they will answer you in different ways, giving you more angles to look at the problem and understand it. You have a better chance at solving the problem, if you know the answer to it.

If you ask one person on a topic, most of the time, they will give you a biased answer. Biases can have misleading information and only share their side of the story. To avoid bias, you can talk to many people about it to get multiple opinions. That way, you get both sides of the story and can form your own opinion about the subject.

Lastly, if you were to ask someone a question, the person could give you the wrong answer. No one knows everything, so when you ask someone a question, you aren't always given the correct answer. To solve this, you ask different people on the same topic. This way, when you need a answer, you are most likely to get the correct one.

When asking multiple people on a topic, question, opinion, etc. you will get better results than with just one person. You understand the solution more, avoid bias and get the correct answer more often. This is why you should ask for multiple people's help.",0
"In the United States of America, and all over the world, cars are used every day. People use them to get to work, to go see family, and to get simply, from A to B, but a new idea is sprouting up in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere where people are doing something unheard of.... giving up their cars. According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"",  Vauban, Germany is a city that is almost completely car free. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" THis shws that living without cars is not only possible, but could have some great consequences.

Living car free could seem like something impossible, but it has great effects. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a study ervealing that passenger cars are responsible for 12 peercent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe....and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Without cars, we could lower pollution, which is a huge problem for some places. In the second article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris has to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city after days of near-record pollution. Motorist with even number liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars on day and motorists with odd numbered plates were ordered to the next day. This enforcement had positive consequences along with it. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital and the smog hanging over the city eventually cleared. This shows almost immediate benefits to the decline in driving. Can you imagine the benefits after a long term period of car-free cities? The possibillities are limitless.

Car-free periods of time don't have to be long term. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day takes place every year and it is a ""big hit"" with millions of Colombians according to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". For the third straight year, cars have been banned only excluding busses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog in the city of 7 million. Anyone who violated the rules were fined 25 dollars. For the first time ever, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined in the event. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This should show that car free periods of time are possible, not matter how long, and that they have great consequences that come along with them.

You might say that it would be extremely difficult to make America a car free country. Well, according to a report in the fourth article ""The End of Car Culture"" America may be on it's way. Research studues show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The nummber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to a analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Thsi shows that there is a steady decline in driving and autiomotive transport in America. Also found in the fourth article, if the pattern persists, it will have beneficial impliactions for carbon emmisions and the enviorment. Many sociologists believe the pattern will continue. Alternate sources of transportation have popped up also. In New York, a new bike sharing program has popped up and in San Fransisco, Bay Arear Rapid Transit is another viable option of transport. With all of these options, doesn't one fit you?

In conclusion, alternate transport oppurtunities and car free periods of time are the solution. With so many ways to lower how much and how you drive. The switch to a more economic means of transport would be easier than you think. The possibillities are endless and multiple studies show that the good consequences outweigh the bad ones. One question is yet to be asked, are you ready to make the switch to the better way of tansport?                                                                                                               ",0
"Do you think everyone should be put in an extracurricular activity? I think we should allow this because maybe some students are lonely, maybe some of them need to make friends.

Some people need to work together with other people because their a social butterfly. Some sports like football and basketball help you interact with people because you need that whole team to help you score.

Me on the other hand I like to be independent when it comes to certain things like track if you run track you most likely run alone. Like with having anyone to count on, if you run a relay you mostly need your teammates to help you get the baton passed around to win the race. We do need to stay somewhat in shape though like go for a run once a while. Some of us arent sporty types of people maybe you want to help someone or volunteer for somethings like year book club or the Special Olympics. You could make a club for your school like the homework club or a gaming club or even a after school tutoring class to help people out with there grades.

You could go out and volunteer none of this has to be school related you could just help the community out go plant some trees help the earth. I think we should have a running club or maybe a conditioning club for people who want to train for some like tryouts for a sport or just wanna stay in shape. But if some people dont want to do some things after school maybe we can have some things made to be in the early morning I used to have choir rehersal evryday in the morining and it was sometimes really tiring. But also fun you get to hangout with my

So yes I do agree that we need everyone to do some sort of after school activity. ",0
"Making choices is hard sometimes, but getting advice from people makes it easier to make that choice. Advice can point you the right way that you want to go, or it can show you what you don't want to do. This is why its important to get multiple opinions. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows someone to get different perspectives, compare and contrast opinions, and be confident and sure about their decision.

Everyone has a different perspective, so when asking for advice different people are going to see the situation differently and give different advice. Getting different perspectives helps you see the situation in ways other people see it. Only having one perspective means you may think that there is only one right thing to do, but by seeing the situation the way others do you could discover that there is a better option. Walking in somebody elses shoes can help you make a better decision for not only yourself, but everyone.

Not only does everyone have a different perspective, but everyone has a different opinion as well. When you ask for advice people give you their opinions of what you should do. Comparing and contrasting these opinions shows you what opinions are most similar to yours and which are completely different from your opinions. If you compare someones opinion to yours it can also show you what choice you do not want to make.

Comparing and contrasting is like weighing the pros and cons of each option. Seeking multiple opinions helps you make a more confident decision because you can see what other people believe and see, as the pros and cons of each option. One option may have more pros than cons after you ask the advice of others, which shows you that it is the right thing to choose. Being confident in the choice your making makes you feel good and not regret that choice.

Making the right choices can take time but if you seek multiple opinions by getting different perspectives, compare and contrast the opinions, and be confident in your choice, you will have made the best decision you could have made.",0
"I think we all should do community service. It would really help the environment to be a whole lot better. There's a program where you sign up to do daily work after school to help clean up that people do. I do my best to keep my family from littering, because I wanted to be in the program but my mom said that she doesn't have time to pick me up after it. Since I can't be in it I told my mom that I am going to be picking up trash when ever I can. She said that I could do that. Most of my friends do try to clean up, but they don't have time or their mom's won't let them. so they don't litter so it at least doesn't make it worse. Most of my family doesn't litter, because one of my cousins hate it when people litter . So she don't yell at them they don't litter. And if they do they don't do it in front of her.",0
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that making my own decisions and following my instincts are crucial in shaping my life. I believe that individuals should be able to make their own choices without being swayed by external factors such as societal norms or the opinions of others.

Firstly, making our own decisions allows us to take responsibility for our actions and their consequences. When we make choices based on our own beliefs and values, we are able to live with the outcomes of those decisions. This can lead to personal growth and development, as we learn from our mistakes and make better decisions in the future.

Additionally, following our instincts can lead to new and exciting opportunities. When we trust our gut and take risks, we can discover new paths and experiences that we may not have otherwise encountered. For example, if I had not followed my instinct to take a particular class in high school, I may not have discovered my passion for science and technology.

However, making our own decisions can also lead to negative outcomes. Sometimes, our instincts may lead us down a path that is not in our best interest. Additionally, people's opinions and reactions can influence our decisions, even if we try to ignore them. For example, if my friends convinced me to try a certain food, I may not have enjoyed it as much as I would have if I had tried it on my own.

In conclusion, making our own decisions and following our instincts can have both positive and negative outcomes in our lives. However, I believe that the benefits of taking responsibility for our choices and discovering new opportunities outweigh the potential risks. It is important to trust our gut and make decisions based on our own beliefs and values, even in the face of external pressures or opinions.",1
"Influence on others is a powerful tool that can shape the way people think, act and behave. It can be positive or negative, depending on the type of influence and the impact it has on individuals and society. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the positive and negative aspects of influence on others, identify examples of both, and explain the impact of influence on people.

On the positive side, influence can be a driving force for change and progress. For example, a leader who inspires their followers to work towards a common goal can have a tremendous impact on society. The civil rights movement in the United States is an excellent example of how positive influence can bring about meaningful change. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X used their influence to rally people to fight for equality and justice. Their messages of hope and determination inspired millions of people to take action and make a difference.

Another positive aspect of influence is the ability to foster creativity and innovation. When people are exposed to new ideas and perspectives, they are more likely to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to problems. For example, the tech industry is full of individuals who have used their influence to create new and exciting products and services.

On the negative side, influence can also be a force for harm and destruction. For example, a charismatic leader who uses their influence to manipulate and control others can have a devastating impact on individuals and society. The rise of dictatorships and authoritarian regimes throughout history is a prime example of how negative influence can lead to suffering and oppression.

In addition, negative influence can also lead to the spread of harmful ideas and beliefs. For example, the influence of social media on young people has been shown to have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being. Exposure to violent and hateful content can also lead to the spread of intolerance and bigotry.

In conclusion, influence on others can be a powerful tool for positive or negative change. While positive influence can bring about meaningful change and foster creativity and innovation, negative influence can lead to harm and destruction. It is important for individuals to be aware of the impact of their influence on others and to use it responsibly. By doing so, we can create a world that is more just, equitable, and peaceful.",1
"According to research, expecting students to identify a career by the time they enter high school can have many advantages, particularly in terms of giving students an early start to focusing on preparation for their desired career. Such preparation might involve taking relevant classes or courses, engaging in internships, participating in job shadowing experiences, or joining extracurricular activities in their desired career field. This early start could give students an edge when it comes to getting accepted into college and/or the job of their choice after graduation. 

However, there are some drawbacks to students deciding on a career choice late in their educational timeline. For example, the more narrow timeframe could cause them to feel overwhelmed and less likely to take the steps mentioned above to adequately prepare. This could have serious negative implications for the student's future, as a lack of preparation may lead to less desirable college and job choices.

There are also various reasons why some students put off deciding on a career. These can range from lack of knowledge about possibilities, fear of making the wrong decision, or simply feeling unready to commit to one career option. It is important for students to realize that they have plenty of time to hone in on their career choice and that they do not need to make a final decision before they start their high school journey.",1
"Have you ever wondered what it's like to attend school without actually leaving your house? It seems that nowadays, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This may either be a temporary or permanent way of learning, depending on the case of the school and student. Although many people may view this distance learning opportunity as a good thing, I see it as negative to the learning experience. I do not think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the bond between teachers and students would be lost, cheating would become far more easy for students to accomplish, and students may be too easily distracted in a more familiar and comfortable environment.

In school, teachers are able to test the knowledge of students by giving them assignments and checking them, however, with online classes it is impossible for a teacher to know and understand if a student is learning. There also seems to be a bond that is broken between students and teachers, as teachers can help with more than just schoolwork. Not only do students lose the opportunity to address questions in person but they also lose someone they can talk to if they need help in their lives. Although at times it may not seem like the bond between teachers and students is one that can be important in a students life, certain teachers may be people who students are able to look up to and are inspired by to continue putting effort into their work now, as well as in the future. Without actually ever seeing your teacher, a student may forget why they are doing the work they do, as they may prefer to begin doing something else that they believe will benefit them more, for example, focusing more on their chores at home rather than their schoolwork. It seems that a certain part of effort in school comes from the student wanting to make a teacher proud and with introducing online classes, not only is the bond between teachers and students broken, students do not have a reason for submitting hard work to a teacher they have never met in person.

Another reason why I believe students are not benefiting from online classes at home is because cheating becomes a lot easier for students to achieve. For example, in school a teacher will often collect students' phones and place dividers between them before tests and quizzes in order to limit cheating. If a test is online, a teacher will often check a student's online web history to make sure they did not open other tabs during the time of the exam. If a student is learning from home, what is stopping them from opening another tab online and finding every single answer to a test or quiz? When there is no limit to how a student can use the internet from their home, they could use it to cheat by doing many things like looking up answers as well as sharing answers with friends in the same class; furthermore, students learn less from home as when students cheat on exams, it shows that they did not necessarily learn anything beforehand and they do not learn anything while taking the test as all of the answers can simply be looked up.

Also, you cannot expect that students will care to remember the answers to the questions they happened to search.

As for the schools that do partake in online classes from home, I am sure that the students are still able to benefit in some way. Students may prefer to learn in an environment that is more comfortable and accessible to them and also learn in an environment where they do not have to live in constant fear of being wrong or bullied. Students may also be happier in the comfort of their own home, as it seems that many students who must wake up with the purpose of going to school are not motivated or prepared to learn, possibly due to the environment of certain schools. However, there still remains the case that students will become distracted too easily and will begin to focus on other things besides school. Students learning from home could also have a hard time not entertaining themselves by playing video games, watching movies, or even inviting friends over. Students may feel happier and safer in their homes, although the amount of distractions that are offered will cause a student's focus to eventually stretch away from school and the student will become less and less knowledgeable.

In conclusion, it seems that with the introduction of online classes in schools, there happens to be another way of learning that is offered. However, I do not see this way of learning as beneficial as it causes students to put less effort into their work and education. Students will not only have a hard time finding motivation to work, but will also learn less in general. Overall, this lack of effort can be exemplified by the fact that a student does not receive any motivation to learn or advice from a teacher, it is easier for students to cheat in ways such as looking up answers or sharing answers as no internet regulations are placed on them like they would be on an exam during school, and students are easily distracted at home, whether it is through their television or games. I do believe that one day, all schools may offer online classes, however, by then I hope there is a way to further motivate students, as well as more regulations placed on their online home learning experience.                   ",0
"The face of Mars is a natural landform. It has become what they call pop icon. There was an alien sight theorolists say on Mars called the NASA. But i disagree with them.

"I am for the develpment of these cars because i feel like it would be safer and everyone would have a ride and wouldn't have to walk. It would also save a lot of gas and energy from all the cars that won't be used, and only the driverless cars would be using gas. The driverless cars offer far more flexibility than a bus as well. The article also mentions such cars would change the world.

If the cars crahsed or stopped working who's fault would it be? Will the human have to drive the car in and out of the driveway as well ?

"Hey there! 

So, the school board is thinking about adding an extra hour and a half to our school day.  I mean, I get it, they want us to learn more and stuff, but come on, can't they see how much homework we already have?!  It's like, how are we supposed to fit in extra school time and still get enough sleep?! 

I mean, think about it. If we go to school for an extra hour and a half, that means we'll be there from 8am to 3pm.  That's a total of 5 hours in school!  And then we have to do homework in the evening, which can take up to 2 hours.  That means we'll be up until 11pm at least, trying to finish our assignments. 

And don't even get me started on the impact it'll have on our sleep.  I mean, I know the school board thinks we're little robots who can just power through our schoolwork and still get 8 hours of sleep, but let's be real.  We're teenagers. We need our sleep.  And with that extra hour and a half in school, it'll be even harder to get the rest we need. 

So, what can we do about it?  Well, I think the school board should consider some alternatives.  Maybe they could add more breaks throughout the day, so we can actually take a breather and relax.  Or, they could give us more time to finish our homework, so we're not staying up late every night. 

I mean, I know the school board wants us to be well-rounded and stuff, but they also need to think about our well-being.  We're not machines, you know.  We need rest and relaxation too.

"Someone takes a selfie, and sends it to their friend trying to make it seem like they are completely happy with no problems at all. However, what if you were able to tell if your friend is really happy or not? There is a facial coding system that can identify other's emotions. The use of this technolgy to read emotional expressions is valuable because, it can recognize facial movements to see how other's feel, the computer can make faces seem more expressive, and it also teaches you more about your smile and whether it is genuine or forced.

It has been shown that Mona Lisa was about 83% happy when the picture was taken, it shows that it was mostly a happy smile. There are usually ablout six different kinds of emotions, such as,""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". This shows that there many emotions that could be discovered by just a simple picture. As an example, your eyebrows are usually raised when your are surprised or your lips would be tightened to show anger. The software would usually have mixed emotion, and it is usually compared to a nuetral face that shows no emotion. We humans are actually able to do the same thing, just by the look/expression on their face. Some specific artists such as, da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint specific emotions with facial emotions.

Computers are capable of doing many different things that not even humans can do. One very important thing is creating different expressions for others. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This was said by Dr. Huang, and it was normally used to make even animated faces more expressive. It is true that most human communication is nonverbal, and some computers may need to understand that too. There are some simple instructions that encode different emotions, this was also used to create Mona Lisa's smile.

This system teaches you more about your smile and whether it is forced or not. There is certain muscular action units that indicate the difference between both smiles. For the real smile which is called ""zygomatic major"" which are actually muscles that begin at your cheek bones, it would lift the corners of your mouth. However for the false smile, the mouth would be stretched out sideways and it would ues the zygomatic major and the risorius. To many exerts they know that it is true thatfaces tell the truth and when a celebrity takes a selfie with a false smile, it is usually a sign that it they are not being truthful. There is an important theory of emotion that expresses and produces emotions.

Facial action coding systems can be used for very useful things. This this technology is extemely valuable because, it is able to recognize how others feel by facial movements, more expressive faces can be made with these computers, it shows the difference between genuine smiles and forced smiles.

"After researching, I found that setting an example by your own behavior to influence other people can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Two advantages associated with setting an example are fostering a more obedient and disciplined environment, and inspiring others to strive for the goals you have achieved. One main disadvantage to setting an example is that others may see you as arrogant, creating tension and mistrust. In conclusion, setting an example has the potential to be both positive and negative, so it is important to consider both sides before engaging in this type of behavior.",1
"Luke seems to like the program, because you help people of other countries,you also play baseball,volleyball, you can fence, table tennis, boxing, reading, and whittling. You can actually see what happens around the world and help other countries.

""It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs,"" Luke says, you can help countries that are in ruins after World War II. You get to take care for horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. It is a huge responsibility, but it is worth doing. You get to feed the animals, which is like going to a petting zoo for free, besides all the work. You also get to travel to places while you are at a certain country. I wouldn't think it is so easy, because you have to do a lot of work it is harder than it sounds, but you are doing it for a good purpose. It is certainly a great opportunity to help animals get good care and to travel to other countries. I would love the sight seeing and feeding the animals. Although it seems like a lot of work, Luke seemed to have a blast.

I think Luke had a great time and so will you when you get the opportunity to help animals get special care and to help the countries of the world.",0
"Nice day to go out with your friends enjoy and yourself, after a stressful week at work. You and your friends decided it will be a good idea to head to a soccer game to cheer your favorite team on.

Y'all give each other a task to bring something to feel comfortable doing the game. Some one bring chairs, snacks/food, and something to drink. You get in your car headed to the game, you at the red light when PROPER_NAME decided to text you"" Make sure you got the drinks"" light changes you start back driving focused on the text. Out of nowhere Errrrrrrr BOOM!.

Its really not a good idea to text don't matter the cause. You should pay attention at all times because you don't know what could happen. You could injury yourself or even kill someone.

No one would want to live with something on there mind forever remembering bad a bad event.

You should think about other people before you get in your car. Is being on a phone more import than your life and others lives?

Every year approximately almost 22% of Americans are mostly teens who are involve in crashes. While being on a phone talking or texting. You will be better off walking than texting and driving. Texting and driving can be worse than drinking and driving sometimes. The difference is that you have a person that's drunk person that's trying to get home while drunk. But on the other hand you have a person that's on they're phone and driving, but is not paying attention .

Almost every second in different countries you have somebody getting in a accident because of people like this. Since the development of technology this has made the death rate go up. People has been paying more attention to they're phones since phones came out. Not saying phones is a problem, people just don't know what to choose what's important these days. I don't get what's important your life or your phone. Your phone still gone be they're after you reach your destination.       ",0
"Summer Projects

By: Generic_Name

Students are in school for 7 hours a day, 45 hours a week, 180 hours a month, and 180 days a year which is a very long time. Many schools in the United States require students to complete a project/assignment to assure that they keep learning over the summer. Students usually feel overwhelmed and stressed about these summer projects because of having to do assignments during their break. I believe that summer projects should be student designed because it allows students to freely choose a topic and not be stressed or worried throughout the whole summer.

When students get assigned summer projects they usually ignore or not do them because the topic might be too boring, hard to do, takes a long time, etc. That's mainly because our teachers don't let them be student designed projects. Student designed projects are when the student gets to choose their own topic, do the work they want to do, and do everything based on what they want. Students hope that it could be student designed projects so it could take some weight off their shoulders and making it a topic they are comfortable with.

Counter Claim: Summer projects should be teacher designed because not all students have great decision making abillities and don't have the skillset to do a project without the teachers help. If it were student designed then they would most definitly go off topic or show poor work and effort on the project. Teacher designed projects are when the teacher is in control. For example, they choose the topic, they choose what research you need to do, they choose if its an essay or a presentation, etc. Teacher designed projects help students get ready for the upcoming school year and what they are gonna be learning in class.

Student designed projects can help the students by learning how to do things on their own, help them gain amazing decision making skills, and gain experiences to help them later on in life. When the teacher's in control for everything then the student may lack in motivation or the will to even do the project. These projects can't help a student grow and learn if they are restricted to certain things that they can and can't do. Students should have the ability to do summer projects on their own with no stress and/or no restrictions.

In sum, students get assigned projects or assignments to take home over the summer so that they could keep learning even during the break. Schools usually make these projects designed by the teacher(s). I believe that these projects should be student designed because summer is meant to be our break, we shouldn't have to have stress or anxiety because of these projects during our summer. Student designed projects can help us gain experiences as a student that we would never learn if they were teacher designed. They also help students feel that they are in control and it could help a student thrive to higher expectations.                                                                              ",0
"Technology has become an integral part of our lives in the 21st century. It is nearly impossible to imagine how we functioned without the help of technology for so many tasks and duties. Technology has both positive and negative effects on people's lives.

On the positive side, technology offers convenience and accessibility to people. It makes daily tasks easier and can decrease the time it takes us to complete them. Communication is also greatly enhanced because of the internet and all of the different ways we can now contact each other, such as emails, messaging apps, and social media. Additionally, technology helps us get access to a wealth of information that might otherwise be difficult to obtain.

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks associated with technology. For example, it has been linked to an increase in mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Additionally, many of us spend a great deal of time on our devices, which leaves us with little time for other activities and relationships.

In conclusion, while technology brings many benefits to our lives, it is also important to be aware of the potential risks. We should be mindful of how much time we spend on our devices and remember to take time away from them to engage in meaningful activities.",1
"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democratic(Plumer-Paragraph-9).

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privaleges. A poll of over 6/10 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be contreversal though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the contreversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. Kennedy(Plumer-Paragraph-10-11)

There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronism(Posner-Paragraph-15). If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice.    ",0
"Is driving a car really that crucial? Do people really need their own personal means of transportation? Around the world people are limiting their usage of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage are lower pollution, you can decrease your expenses by not having to pay a car payment or insurance, and many people have started to limit car usage so you dont have to worry about standing out socially.

Pollution is a big issue when it comes to driving because cars cause a lot of pollution. In Paris a partial driving ban has been passed to try and clear the smog out of the city. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day"" Duffer 11. 4,000 people were fined but congestion was down 60 percent. This was done because paris has more smog than other European capitals. Smog is not the only reason you should limit your car use if you dont have a car at all you are probably saving a lot of money.

If you limit your car use to the point where you dont even own a car you can save a lot of money. You wouldn't have to pay your car payment and you wouldn't have to pay for insurance either. The downside of this is you would have to rely on other means of transportation and it would be hard to if you lived in a large city. If you lived in Vauban Germany however, you could bet away without a car. "" While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs.... Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life"" Rosenthal 6. In this suburban area people have given up their cars and turned to ""smart planning"". Some people are not worried about the money or pollution involed but are more concerned about they will be accepted socially.

Social acceptance is what holds some people back from limiting car use. Even for those people limiting car use will not be a problem because in the united states car use has declined. ""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily there after"" Rosenthal 32. This means that either Americans are going to keep steadily declining from using cars or this is just the younger generation and once they grow up they will have to get cars to go about their routines as adults.

The main reasons for limiting car usage are lower pollution, not spending as much money, and not having to worry about social acceptance. It is for these reasons that limiting car use is not only good but it is an advantage.",0
"Okay, here is my essay:

Hey, guys, like, I know it's super important to work hard and put in effort if you want to achieve your goals in life. I mean, think about it, if you don't try, you'll never get anywhere!

" When seeking advice, do you prefer to consult with one person or a group of individuals? While it may be tempting to confide in just one person, seeking advice from multiple individuals can provide a more well-rounded perspective. When you share your concerns with multiple people, you may receive a variety of opinions and recommendations, which can help you make a more informed decision.

For example, let's say you are facing a difficult situation in your life and are seeking advice on how to handle it. You may turn to a few close friends or family members for guidance. While each person may offer their own unique perspective, their advice may not necessarily align with one another. However, by considering all of the different viewpoints, you may be able to identify a common thread or approach that works best for you.

On the other hand, you may prefer to confide in just one person, as it can be easier to open up and share your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust. This person may be able to provide a more personalized and empathetic response, as they have a deeper understanding of your unique situation.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to seek advice from one person or a group of individuals depends on your personal preference and the specific situation at hand. However, it's important to remember that seeking advice from multiple individuals can provide a more well-rounded perspective and may lead to a more informed decision.",1

"Think about a country without cars. You might say thats rediculous but there are many pros to not having a fuel running engine as your transportation all the time. There are some families that dont even own cars. automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically to reduce geenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes.

Passanger cars are responsble for more than 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. There have been efforts in the past two decades to make sities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. Basic presets are being compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. Stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Using to many cars for transportation isnt so good for any city, state, country for example France. After days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog. Most cars run on fuel so diesel fueal was blamed the majority of pollution in the air that cars produced. Delivery companies would complain of lost revanue, the exceptions were only made for plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge.

Its a really good opporunity  to take away all the stress and lower are pollution. Cars are great for transportation but the days without cars can be part of an improvement all around the world. parks and sports center can bloom throughout the city, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. If we persist with using car transportation as a resource less it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since  transportation is the second largest source of America emissions.

"I agree with policy 1, but not without certain rules. Cell phones are used in almost everyone's daily life. It makes people feel safer when they can pull a phone from their pocket and call for help. Unfortunately, in today's society they are used for more then needed. I think it would be all right to allow children to use cell phones during breaks and lunch, but in classrooms the rules would have higher punishment. For example, making the cost higher to get it back or longer detention. That would be more suitable.

When people are stopped from doing something completely they will most likely do it more. In my personal experience, about six months ago I went to a school that had such tight policies about cell phones, if phones were even seen in your pocket they would be taken up. Therefore the children used them all the time, in class, lunch, anywhere and anyway they could.

Now, when I go this school, children are allowed to carry cell phones around and I see them being used so much less, the teachers aren't always talking about how the phones are never allowed, they make it easier on everyone. Seen and not heard.

Of course, in extreme cases, policy 2 would be better, it depends solely on what kind of environment your in. Although in my school I see no good reason why not to allow cell phone usage on breaks, I think it would create a less stressful place. Teachers could even send notifications to the students, if that could be allowed, about homework updates or due dates. Besides cell phone are probably one of the most used, most owned devices in America, why not use them to help us with school and not get us in trouble.      ",0
"Imagine your'e principal made extracurricular activities outside of school mandatory, activities outside of school can be a good way to socialize with your'e peer's, but there are some drawbacks to forced extracurricular activities. Activities outside of school can be a good thing if they are willingly done by the person, compared to being forced into doing an activity. Studies have shown that if someone is forced into doing a selected activity, they wouldn't enjoy it as much as they would compared to the person doing the activity willingly. Some student's already are doing things outside of school such as, helping at their local food bank, volunteering at their church, or they could just be leading a small study group. There are some student's out there that aren't interested in doing anything outside of school either because they can't or they just don't want to do anything after dismissal time. For some student's, activities outside of school could really help their social skills by exposing them to a new environment, with new people, and new challenges to face. In conclusion doing things outside of school could be a good thing for students if they do it willingly and if there are many options to choose from,not just activities associated with school, but continuous activities in the community too.

When doing activities outside of school there can be many things to choose from. Some activities that student's can get involved in outside of school may include volunteering at a local non-profit, organizing a study group, or it could be as simple as doing a sport, the possibilities are virtually endless! If your'e principal made it so that the extracurricular activity was some how associated with school, there are still plenty of options out there. Some activities that may be associated with your'e local school may include sports, yearbook club,National Junior Honor Society, or even a chess club, there is still a lot you can do after school, but not as many activities you could do that isn't associated with school. There are some districts that have already implemented this into their schools, which for most of the schools they had to add more clubs that fit the students interests. A resent study shows that the students who did extracurricular activities preformed better on a social IQ test compared to students who didn't do any activities outside of school. If schools did implement this change they would need more staff to lead the clubs or to form new clubs to fit the students needs, thats why it would be best if the school system stayed the same with a few minor changes to the systems.

Activities can be healthy for students, if the students like what they are doing. Students may not want to do things after school, except to just go home. While there are some kids who absolutely love to do things outside of school because it can be a good social experience for them. A survey recently done by a New York institute, seventy five percent of the time when teens are forced into something they resent and do the opposite of what is told of them. To sum every thing up, The school systems should allow the students to have free choice of what they do, schools need to make the kids of tomorrow more independent and allow them to choice their own path of what they want to do.",0
"Do you really want all of your choices to be influenced by the same person? In today's world, most people think they only have to ask one persons advice. People should seek for multiple opinions because it makes sure they aren't being controlled by only one person, it may give them different viewpoints they never would've considered, and it will give them more information about the topic that they never would've known.

More than one opinion will make sure they are not being influenced by only one person. If they are only asking for one persons advice, that person can take advantage of the situation and control them. For example, when I was in 5th grade, I would always go to the same person for advice. They would always tell me to do things I didn't want to do but nevertheless, I would always do whatever they suggested. In retrospect, I should've asked for more peoples opinions so that I could see that there were more paths to follow.

Multiple opinions may give them different viewpoints on a topic they might not have considered. If they only ask one person about everything, they will most likely follow that persons beliefs. They have to figure out for themselves what they think and not rely on others to make the tough decisions for them. For example, when I thought my friend had been spreading rumors about me, I wanted to confront her immediately. Before I disscused it with her, I asked multiple people if they knew anything and I'm glad that I did. They told me the allegations were false and I was extremely happy I didn't rush to conclusions and ended a friendship for no good reason.

More than one opinion will give them more information about the topic so that they can make a more educated choice. One person doesn't know everything. To make a full decision, you need to know all the facts. You wouldn't find everything out from one person. For example I had my heart set on a presidential candidate that I wanted to win. One day, the topic of the presidential election came up in conversation when I was discussing it with my friend. She told me other things about his platform that I did not support. I was happy that I talked to her about it because it showed me that I can't believe everything the media shows me.

People should seek for multiple opinions because it makes sure they aren't being influenced by only one person, it may give them different viewpoints they never would've considered, and it will give them more information about the topic they never would've known. Are you going to allow yourself to be controlled by one person?",0
"Students would benefit attending school from home in many ways.... students would be able to work in a quiet environment with no distractions from other students. Another reason why it would be better would be because, some students work in their own speed and won't be worried about how fast others finish. Sometimes students are more focused on who finishes first and sometimes think it's a race. students would also have the chance of working on their own time when they can,like that students could proprobly finish their work faster. Online school could also be better for students sleep schedule, like that students could be more rested and would be able to focus on their work.

Better sleeping schedule would help kids focus more on their work and would be able to stay up, whens students dont sleep well the tend for fall asleep in class. Falling asleep in class effects on class grades because student pay less attention. Having to wake up early and get ready on time is hard work,making it on time to school is a big task. Just having online classes from home would be better for everyone in general, would honestly make students life much more easier. Online school should just be a thing for students because its less stressful and much easier.",0
" I believe that students would not benefit from taking online classes or video conferencing from home. While there are some advantages to this method of learning, such as increased flexibility and convenience, there are also several drawbacks that make it difficult for students to succeed.

One of the main reasons why students may not learn as much through online classes is that they lack the guidance and support of a real teacher. In a traditional classroom setting, teachers are able to provide students with personalized explanations and feedback, which can help them to understand the material better. When students are learning online, they may not have access to the same level of guidance and support, which can make it more difficult for them to understand the material.

Another reason why students may not learn as much through online classes is that they are often more distracted at home. When students are taking classes from home, they may be more likely to be distracted by other activities, such as watching TV or playing video games. This can make it difficult for them to focus on the material and can lead to a lack of engagement in the learning process.

In addition to these factors, students may also struggle with the lack of structure and routine that comes with online learning. In a traditional classroom setting, students have a set schedule and are expected to attend classes and complete assignments on a regular basis. When they are learning online, they may not have the same level of structure and routine, which can make it more difficult for them to stay on track and complete their work.

Overall, while online classes and video conferencing can be a convenient and flexible way for students to learn, there are also several drawbacks that make it difficult for them to succeed. Without the guidance and support of a real teacher, students may struggle to understand the material and may be more likely to be distracted. The lack of structure and routine can also make it difficult for them to stay on track and complete their work.",1
"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research the different topics studied in the sciences, like biology, chemistry, physics, and astronomy. And let me tell you, there's a lot to learn! 

First off, I found out that scientists use all sorts of cool tools and methods to study these topics. Like, did you know that biologists use microscopes to examine tiny things like cells and bacteria? And chemists use things called spectroscopes to study the properties of chemicals. 

But wait, there's more! I also learned about this fancy term called ""scientific notation."" It's like a special way of writing numbers that helps scientists measure really big or really small things. Like, instead of writing a number like 123,456,789, they can write it as 1.23456789 x 10^9. 

And let's not forget about the definition of ""scintilla."" It means the smallest amount of something, like the tiniest spark of an idea. 

But science isn't just about learning cool facts and terms. It's also super important for our day-to-day lives. Like, did you know that scientists are working on developing new medicines to cure diseases? Or that they're trying to find ways to make our air and water cleaner? 

Now, I know some people might think that becoming a science expert takes forever, but it's actually not that long. Like, depending on what you want to study, you can become an expert in just a few years. 

But, there are some challenges too. Like, sometimes scientists have to deal with things like fake news and people not believing in science. 

Lastly, I found out that chain changes and bevels have a big impact in science. Chain changes are like small changes that can lead to big changes, and bevels are like special tools that help scientists make those changes. 

So, that's pretty much it",1
"Splash! The bucket of paint hits the canvas as soon the extra class starts. I would like to agree with the decision of an extra class for all students to at least participate in one extra activity. An example for an extra class is like to design in the yearbook,learning art,and making new friends.

First of all,designing in the yearbook for the whole school to see would be an outstanding work of art. Helping out for the yearbook could be fun in many ways and taking lovely photos of people as they have fun as well. Doing the yearbook means that the students can also cast a vote on the colors and the font on the yearbook. One of the most important part of the yearbook is the theme, like for spring and summer or even the school mascot.

Secondly, learning art is also fun to have for an extra class and getting to experience a new feeling to learn more about the activity. Having art class could interest other students to join or having art cast their future job. Learning for an extra class can improve on a students skill or there love for art, and to give the students an opportunity to show off their talents for the whole school to see one day.

Third of all, having a new class to go to could help out some students to make new friends and build there trust more. Team bonding is also a way to make new friends and help each other out to learn from each other. Having new friends can also lead into a group project, and build up the trust that students can make. Students can have similar skills, like to paint in the same or close style, and may also think the same idea as one another student has.

Lastly, having an extra event for students is a fantastic idea and making school a bit more exciting to go, giving the students an opportunity to choose what they are going to be in the future. Getting a new generation in the world would save a lot of people and change the future one day.",0
"Aliens! Ha not true. In the article Unmasking the Face on Mars. we have put out an image of the face on Mars. This Face was not made by aliens becuase its like a normarl landform found on Earth, authors made it so the public would be attracted to Mars, and it was proven to be a landform just like any other. This is not made by aliens it look alot like common land forms found on Earth.

From the ship point of view its just as if it were a landform found on Earth. First, in the text it states ""the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Showing that is just somthing found normally on a landmass. Second, the unusual shadows in the photos make it look Egyptain. Like something that would naturally form in that kind of climate. Lastly, on the JPL web site it revealed as a natural landform and not an alien monument.

Authors who put out the photos of the Face on Mars made it so the public would be attracted to it. First of all when people try making something interesting they could lie. In the article it states ""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It certainly did!"" Then, somthing they said made it a huge hook. This was put into a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. Lastly, All of this got people thinking that NASA would rather hide anything they really have about life on Mars. In what case we have nothing to hide because the face is just a normal land mass.

The face was proven to be a landform. First off, befor it was put out to the public it was said to have looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Nothing had to do with any other life form on Mars. After, It was all put out to the public and made into a huge deal people started to think we were hiding somthing at NASA. When really we stated it could be a landform befor all of it was in a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. Lastly, it states ""On a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Proving it was never anything made by aliens.   ",0

dont u think beignable to have your scholl education chagne and be for what u can exsell in, and if not that than at lest being able to change it up a lil bit to keep every kid on trck and eger to learn more.

this comuter programe could help so many people be and do the best thay can at what they love. to start this kind of teaching now would most liky be a very costly proseger, but defanitly be worth evey last panny for the new breed of student, born of respect and hunger for the knowlege at hand.",0
"For many years now people have been cutting down on the usage of their cars. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like you become happier, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. many different outcomes come from limiting the amount of time you use your car.

In many countries around the world people have reduced the amount of time they use their cars and the outcome has been phenomenal. Heidrun Walter was asked about how she felt about taking cars out of her life, she answered ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Rosenthal par3. Cars have been liked stress and when cars were taken out of Carlos Arturo plazas life he said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Selsky par24. When cars were taken out of their lifes they felt happier and stress free.

In these last few centuries we have polluted the world more than anyone else has. This is due our technological advances. One of the biggest advance in these centuries is the motor vehicle. The car has now become a household item. Cars are one of the main reasons why our ozone layer is open and we responsible for ""50 percent...of greenhouse gases emissions"" Roseenthal par5. It's shocking to see how far we have advanced but to see how much we have destroyed in the world at the same time is crazy. Paris has become so poluted that they had to get a ""partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer par10. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after fivedays intensifying smog"" Duffer par14. Imagine what would happen if cars were reduced in use for a month.

For many people in these countries they have gotten many benefits back. The government has always used ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" Rosenthal par9. Its shocking how much money goes to bulding roads and not things for the development of our communities. The people in Bogota,Colombia have cut back on their use of their cars anf the money the government usually uses for cars or gas is now going to other things. ""Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city.""Selsky par28. many of the ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Selsky par28. When the goverment did not have to pay for highways or streets they used that money for parks or smooth sidewalks.

Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like people become happierand stress free, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. If everyone cuts back on the time they use their cars the world would be healthier, the population would be heathier and happier, in addition the government would use money for more important things. Reducing the use of cars is step one in the world becoming healthy again.",0
"Our school normally has every student do a project during the summer to keep us learning and its normally designed by teachers but, this year they asked all the students in quick little 1 answer survey the question stated was ""should students or teacher design students summer projects"", so as I thought about it and I realized to myself that even though normally teacher make the project and i agree that they would give us more informed information and standardized questions that are on topic with the information we should learned but I feel as tho less students complete them and have less of a connection to the work and since it being summer more work would make more students procrastinate more to actually complete the work but on the other hand I truly believe agree that summer projects would be accomplished more if it was by student design and students would be more connected to the work and take way less time trying to finish there summer projects.

students during summer tend have a lot of free time except for those who tend to take up summer jobs or camps and are less focus on other things and tend to mainly focus on work during summer and tend not have time to do a large teacher design summer project packet but, it would be easier for those to make there project because design by them and they would focus more something they create would be way will to finish something they design then some work just given to them by a teacher during summer.

when teachers generally design a summer project to help keeps learning they tend make sure its at least enough knowledge and work to keep u busy for month and so u can keep gaining knowledge and when students continue to gain knowledge that means there would less need reteaching students previously learned knowledge and which would make students even smarter then where before.

most time when a summer project is teacher design there way more work to do lot tend question and answer projects packets that tend to be really thick with work normally they will be like a 1,000 page packet with 800 questions and answer with key information coming be for the questions that have read through then answer questions which most find not entertaining and like extra and tend to seriously not do the work because its so much work for them accomplish and they rather do other things with there summer.

when project are normally student design they are normally a creative project you have make and design using the given topic a students are free to show what they actually know and are more connected to the work because they get to set up there project and can have much information as students need or want and help to have little more fun while gaining knowledge.

in conclusion I believe even though teacher design project contain a lot of work and knowledge but tend to be excessive in the questions and required work and furthermore student design projects are better for summer project easier to do most students complete them at a faster rate and over all it shows more what the students learned.",0
"I think video games can contribute to violent behavior. First of all, video games are really fun and it makes us want to play it more and more. But, some video games have violent content like killing, shooting, and fighting. When we play those games, we start to think that violence is okay and it's a way to solve problems. For example, in the game ""Grand Theft Auto"", players can kill people, steal cars, and do other bad things. If we play this game a lot, we might start to think that it's cool to do those things in real life too.

Another reason is that video games can make us feel angry and aggressive. When we lose in a game, we might get mad and want to do something bad. This feeling can stay with us even after we stop playing the game. For example, a study showed that people who played a violent video game were more likely to give a higher voltage of electric shock to a partner in a different game. This shows that video games can make us more aggressive and violent.

Lastly, video games can make us less sensitive to violence. When we see violent things in a game, it can become normal to us. This means that we might not think it's a big deal when we see violent things in real life. For example, a study showed that people who played a violent video game were less likely to help a person who was being attacked. This shows that video games can make us less caring and less willing to help others.

In conclusion, video games can contribute to violent behavior because they can make us think violence is okay, make us feel angry and aggressive, and make us less sensitive to violence. So, it's important for us to be careful about the video games we play and to make sure we don't play too much violent games.",1
"Dear Senator,

According to the articles and arguements given I think the most effective way to get a premeire president for our nation is vote on the behalf of the Electoral College. In my view of the Electoral College has more experience aswell as having a sense of quality and values that they know can change the country.If we depend on the popular vote of the country,only in the favor of the people classes and opinions of the people, it may lead to presidents that cant maintain order of his or her country.Nonethless,the votes of both Electoral College and majority vote is basically as lucky as a flip of a coin,one side may lead to ultimate failure and the depression of a country the other may lead to momentous uprising of the country,in chosing the right leader of the country.Although, based on the criteria I just created is really puzzling your mind about what president is best I believe that the Electoral College may clear things up and make the best decision in favor of the people.

Based on the articles,the Electoral College does knows best because although they lack of democratic pedigree doesnt mean there wont be democrats in the whitehouse, because they have requirements of how to find the best fit no matter what party included.Even if they were unsupportive of the democrats Romney lossed as example of equality of parties on the College's choice.The articles also state that no popular votes determine the election of a president showing that although more than half of the population in the nation picks a candidate it wont matter unless that candidate gets a majority vot of the Electoral College aswell.Stating that the expierience of the College will prevail on the birth of a new president,no matter what party,no matter the odds of a popularity vote, the Electoral College is a perfect example of this nation's motto because they are truely a sign of equality between candidates that might become great presidents of our nation.

Sincerely,PROPER_NAME    ",0
"Too many people during these present days stay on the phone while driving. People should not be able to use cellphones while driving. Over 1.6 million crashes yearly happen according to The National Safety Council. More than 220 million people in the US have a wireless service and just about 80 percent use phones while driving. Did you know you can be charged with multiple charges and a fee of 150 dollars and you lose a point to your driving record.

To me phones should not be used on the roads unless it is for an emergency. I have personally had an experience when my mom was texting and driving which led us almost getting into a car accident. Results from using phones while driving can lead to death, PTSD, depression if you get into a car accident. Using a phone while driving increases the risk of their lives. Also the drivers are more distracted making it hard to focus on the road which is leading to crashing. When stopped at a red light people feel as if it is safe little do they know it is just as risky because a car can come smashing into you and you wouldn't see it. Also you can make people mad because the light could turn green and you could be holding up a line.

For people to use their phone less there was a bluetooth, a hands free thing and air play which all 3 limit the use of the phone where you can just talk. It still is not safe but it is not as bad as using your actual phone. Instead of holding the phone to your ear you just speak, call whoever and you don't have to touch your phone. It is easier to just wait to text or use your phone than to rather take your life. For Iphone users apple company made a do not disturb to mute the notifications, which is when you won't receive any notifications until you turn that mode off. There is also a driving mode you can turn on to send a message to a person who texts or calls you saying that you are driving and they won't see their message until they stop driving and check it.

People shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because of how many crashes there have been yearly and in the past. If you end up using your phone remember there are different modes like the hands free, bluetooth, or airplay. There are a lot of effects that could leave u dead, with PTSD, depression and many other things. You can use the do not disturb as stated, the driving message mode where it sends a message. The laws should be changed on how phones shouldn't be used and they should make it more serious.   ",0
"Some people think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens. Yes I can see what perspective they're comming from because the ""Face on Mars"" was up in space and space isnt just like a place here or there its our galaxy. Who knows what's going on up there everyday? Many people, even scientists believe that the ""Face of Mars"" was indeed infact created by aliens.

Then there was this article about the ""Face on Mars"" it was called, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". It stated that many people had the thought that aliens did in fact create the ""Face of Mars"" and NASA even had scientists go on a mission to unravel the truth about the ""Face on Mars"" with evidence. It stated exactly from the article, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Yes that is great that they were concluding the fact that maybe perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze but they're not sure it was just an assumption. But around April 5,1998 it stated from the article that, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" That is evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" was in fact a landform.

In conclution many people still think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens. NASA even had special missions for the curiousity with the planet and its Face. Many evidence was found through those missions and concluded that it was a landform. Even though many assumed that the "" Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, an image on the JPL website reveals evidence of a natural landform of the ""Face of Mars"".",0
"When giving students free roam with projects they are more likely to complete it proving that, giving students student- designed projects is beneficial. Students want to learn but, they would rather learn about things that intrigue them rather than basic studies. So if teachers are going to assign a project for the summer, have it be a project that five students freedom.

School takes up the majority of the year, which means students have a heavy work load for most of the year. There is no lie in saying that school is stressful and can be very hard on some students. So a few months off of school gives them time to go out and have fun while learning more about themselves rather than school. Giving a student a teacher- designed and enforced project, is going to give students a bad attitude towards school. The project seems forced upon, no student is going to want to complete or feel motivated to complete an assignment that was pushed upon them.

A lot of students would take an average project and get it over with but, there is a big number of students who would never end up getting to it. Motivation is hard to grasp for a lot of students. These are the students who would look at a summer assignment and think ' I have so much time to get this done, I'll do it later' and then never think of it again, let alone complete it. Students motivation in the summer is especially low, they are in vacation mode which is for the most part, stess free. Giving students a teacher- designed project will give them little to no motivation in doing it but, giving them a student- designed project could give them the motivation to complete it.

If students are assigned student-designed projects they can experience something new for themselves while also learning. They have free roam to decide what interests them and what they want to learn. Nobody wants to use their free time to learn about something they don't care for, but they will if it's something they can be passionate about. Students not only get to learn something new but get to learn new things about themselves. Having to find something that interests them can give them new hobbies or passions that they can pursue.

All in all, It is more beneficial to give a student room to improve on their own and decide what they would like to do. ",0
"""Getting something by doing something or doing nothing also bring us something""

We accomplish more if we are always doing something ,because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing ,everytime that we do something no matter what it's we receive something back ,many people called ''reward"" , when we want something and we work hard to get that, we create a confidence in ourself's that we now that by doing something we can get what we want and we motivate ourself to accomplish that. we get more if we do more ,but some people think that by doing nothing you can get something back . accomplishment is something that you get by working hard , giving your best ,and by doing something about it , if we dont do anything we aren't going to accomplish anything or get anything in this life .

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing more. like one time I remember that I was in six grade and I really wanted to participate in the math competition that Generic_Name prepare every year ,only the fastest student's in math can participate ,so Generic_Name tell us that they were math reviews after school to practice for the competition ,but I didn't have the opportunity to stay in does reviews ,because every day in the after school I had swimming practice and I couldn't skip because my classes were already paid , so I remember that I was sad and I start thinking that if I really wanted to be in that competition I should do something to be there ,I start to wake up two hours early in the morning and I would practice math and also I will go to the library in lunch to work on math exercises ,but that sacrifice was worth it because when Generic_Name make the list for the people that would be able to participate in the competition my name was there. My mom always tell me that no matter how many times you fail in getting something , because the next time that you tried you wouldn't do the same mistake twice and at the end because of your effort and hard work you will accomplish everything that you want to make in your life. that's something I will remeber the rest of my life.

We get more by doing more ,because every single time that we do something ,no matter what it's we are going to get something back ''recompense''. when you take your time to do something with patience , will ,and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back ,we have that selfsatisfaction of making someone happy. like when you see a poor child walking in the streets ,looking for food in the trash ,bacause he is hungry and he doesn't have money to buy some food or maybe he doesn't have a mom that can feed him and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food , because you have that feeling of helping him and make him happy once. one time I remember that I went with my mom to work , we went to clean a house of a 79 year old woman that the only company that she had was her dog , so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day , and I didn't know that this woman would became someone special for me. she was very sweet ,kind , and lovely woman that i have ever meet in my life , she use to call me grandaugther and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that lives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say good bye comes, I was really sad because I would not be able to see her again ,but after she left I would always remember the words that she tell me; ""I'm living ,but dont worry because you would always be in my heart ,and i will always have in present everytime that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I learn that when you do something no matter what it is you will always receive something back and that something it can change your life forever.

We get more by doing something ,because if we want something and we work hard to get what we want , we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that ,if we put our effort we can get what we want. like when you are at school and you have alot of assigments to do ,but you still motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done and you make the effort to continue until you are done, that's when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that "" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in , it would help you when you are struggleling to take a important decision that maybe it can change your life. I remember when my sister was confused , because she didn't know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her ,because she believe herself ,she take the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue fordward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted ,but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fail. Sometimes we have to take that fear of failling out of our lifes ,and bring that confidence that would help us to belived in ourself's.

Getting more by doing something, is better than don't do anything expecting that we are going to get something.

By doing something we will always be growing more than what we are , we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another person's , and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it. It's important for people to know that in this life they can have the opportunity to accomplish everything that they want tio improved their life ,but also at the same time they have to know that to accomplish something they have to work hard , have confidence, and they get everything they want in this life.",0
"Single-use plastics have become a hot topic in recent years due to their negative impact on the environment. Many people are calling for a ban on these types of products, while others argue that they should still be allowed. In my opinion, I think that single-use plastics should be banned because they harm the environment.

One of the biggest reasons why single-use plastics should be banned is that they contribute to litter and pollution. These products are designed to be used once and then thrown away, which means that they often end up in landfills or as litter on our streets, beaches, and waterways. This not only looks bad but also harms animals and marine life that can become entangled in plastic waste or mistake it for food.

Another reason why single-use plastics should be banned is that they are made from non-renewable resources. The production of plastic uses a lot of energy and resources, which puts a strain on our planet. Additionally, plastic does not biodegrade, so it will remain in our environment forever. This means that we are creating more and more waste that will never go away.

Finally, banning single-use plastics will encourage people to use more sustainable alternatives. For example, instead of using plastic bags, we can use reusable grocery bags or paper bags. Similarly, we can use refillable water bottles instead of plastic water bottles. This will not only reduce waste but also save money in the long run.

In conclusion, single-use plastics should be banned because they harm the environment, use non-renewable resources, and encourage waste. We need to take action now to protect our planet for future generations.",1
"Dear principal,

I heard you are considering changing the school's policy about sports. As you might know I'm not so fond of sports myself, but students do need exercise for their body. I'm not saying they should fail all their grades and be playing sports all the time. All I'm trying to get to is that, this wont change them. Schools need to encourage kids to take part in daily sports right? This wont motivate them at all, now will it? They need to exercise, after all they're still young. Why cancel sports? Which is very healthy for kids. Why not cancel their dances? Now, this will motivate the whole school to get better grades. But, if you do decide to cancel sports for kids with a grade lower than a B, they can find other places to have fun and play sports. So why try to cancel it for them? Good grades, bad grades every child has rights to choose, it's their own decision if they don't want to be a success in their life. My opinion in this situation is, don't make it impossible for kids with bad grades not to be able to play sports. If you do make this change official, kids will just find another way to play sports with their friends. Good or bad, it may be dangerous. Who will be responsible for teenagers playing in the middle of the street? You, by taking away their privileges. Now I'll leave it for you to decide, is it worth the change?",0
"Dear State Senator,

I'm

NOT

in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I wouldn't like to keep the Electoral Collage because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.We are used to voting for the president and along with that president we would also have the counting of electoral votes, it's wrong. For example, If you lived in Texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who pick the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state coventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themeselves.

All i know that it isnt fair. All of are hard work voting shouldn't go towards them. It should go towards the person we are voting for. Isn't thats why we voted for them? So we can see them suceed. Making us feel like we suceeded because we made them feel welcome and worthy. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that's the problem. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. And that's why

THIS

needs to stop. At them most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend thime in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

In conclusion, It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argument in faor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Bob Dole is right: Abolish the electoral college!

I hope you take sometime to think this over.

"A planet that has enough heat and pressure to melt most metals and crush any submarine may not sound like an ideal location to visit, but scientists at NASA are determined on researching it because even though it has horribly immense climate, it may be the closest planet in our solar system to Earth. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author speaks of how scientists strongly believe that learning more about Venus can lead to answers about the creation of Earth. It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours. In order to research the planet in depth, NASA would need to send living humans to Venus, however, this will be rediculously challenging and even more so dangerous. Even though it is dangerous, the author makes a valid point, NASA should be determined to research Venus since the discoveries made there can possibly give insight on what Earth may become.

Venus may have one of the harshest climates in our solar system, with an average temperature of 800 degrees Farenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. Despite these major differences, it is also believed to be the closest to Earth by means of geological similarity. As stated in the article, scientists believe that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and quite possibly could have even hosted life. This idea is gathered from the similarities in structures between Earth and that volcano of a planet, like valleys, mountains, and an atmosphere. All of these facts are provide the possibility of being able to make human contact on Venus. Not only would that allow scientist to further research what Earth may become, but if humans are able to reside on another planet, it would greatly help rid overcrowding and Venus may be a future inhabitable location for humans.

Obviously, the idea of sending humans to Venus far excedes our current technology, but traveling to that planet may be the future of humanity. The author states that the value of returning to Venus is indesputable, yet horribly dangerous. Danger should not put off scientists into further discovering that planet, but rather it should encourage them to work even harder in order to someday provide a safe passage between Earth and Venus. This would be beneficial to human society, because it could potentially help rid future problems of overpopulation and even provide insight on what Earth may become. This all leads to concluding that the author made a most valid statement and provides evidence that provides wonderful reasoning as to why scientists should explore Venus and the benefits the exploration would provide.

"Dear Principle,

This certainly is a problem. Students getting it in their heads that helping others, and helping our community isn't important! Frankly I am astonished that my peers, my friends are against helping people and their surroundings. Of course they should help! It's benefits the people who they are helping , the world around them, and it keeps the school clean!

To start with, we who work with people in programs such as tutoring, are helping people who need help! People who need tutoring greatly appreciate the help they are given! Not only does this help their sense of pride and accomplishments, it enables then to have a better future, and a better life. Also, I know when I help somebody I get a feeling of pride and I feel happy knowing that I made a difference in that persons well being and in this case their education. Don't we want that kind of feeling for our school?

Secondly, This kind of program could help the person who is helping grade. You could count this as a grade in a certain class or their homerooms. It could also be simply just extra credit. Not only would this make the people who participated become proud of themselves and the grades, their parents would also be proud of their growing grades, and of the school. The would be proud to say, ""My child makes good grades because they help people and their school out."" This would bring people flocking to our school.

Lastly, If we are cleaning up the school, visitors the are looking at and rating our school will see a clean school, where students are proud to be and learn. This could bring sponsors, and money to our school. With more money we could get supplies for our programs, our build a high school. Which, we know we benefit you, and us students.

So you see students shoul be required to participate",0
"I think classes such as art,music,and drama class should be electives. Why should we be required to take art,music,and drama class if we are not interested? Schools should allow students to pick there classes. If we were allowed to pick our electives then students would enjoy school more. We should be able to like our electives not dislike them.

What if student had to take art but they dont like it? They would not try the work and just fail the class. What about drama class,not everyone enjoys it so it shouldnt be required. Not every student wants to sing or play an instrument. Therefore they shouldnt be forced to take a music class.

Although it would be great for some student not all would like those classes. Therefore student should be allowed to pick there classes. If they were electives we would pick classes that interest us and would actually try to do work. Students would pass their classes more. Therefore those class should be electives.",0
"During the summer, some schools will assign projects to their students in order to further the students' studies and to keep them learning. Some schools might have teachers design the projects and assign it to the students while other schools will have the students design their own projects and then they will work on the projects that they designed. Both sides have their advantages and disadvantages but, overall, student-designed projects would be more beneficial to students as they would have more motivation to work on the projects, it would be more interesting and fun for the students, and because they would be able to learn better from the projects.

One big advantage that a student-designed project would have over a teacher-designed project is that, when working on a student-designed project, students will be much more motivated to work. When somebody designs or creates something, they tend to appreciate it more than if it were created by somebody else. As a result, if the students were to design their projects, they would appreciate it more and work harder on the projects. On the other hand, if a teacher were to assign a project that they designed, the students would just see it as another assignment that the teacher has given them and most likely not work very hard on it. As a result of this extra motivation, the students would be much more productive when working on the project.

Another advantage that a student designed project would bring is that the students would be much more interested in the project if they were the ones that designed it. When a student is given the opportunity to design something that they would later work on, they would most likely make it as fun and as interesting as they can possibly make it. They would have a much easier job making the project interesting and enjoyable than the teacher as the students know themselves better than the teachers. If a teacher were to design a project, they would most likely make a much more boring and uninteresting project that the students would not care for. As a result of this increased interest, the students would be much happier and be more energized when working.

On top of this, a project designed by students would be much more effective at helping the students learn, which is the main purpose of the project. Some people might say that teacher designed project would be better and more effective as it is the teachers job to teach the students, however, that is not the case. If given the option, the teachers would assign a project that they think the students would enjoy. However, the teachers might not know exactly what interests the students and what the students find fun. As a result, the teacher-designed project could be very boring and uninteresting to the students. On the other hand, if students were able to design the project, there is a guarantee that the students would be interested in it as they would be able to design the project around their interests and they would also add elements that they would find fun. Furthermore, in the summer months following a long school year, the students want to relax and have a good time. If they were to receive a boring project from their teacher, they wouldn't have much energy and motivation when working on this project which would take away from the learning experience. The student-designed project would be much better at getting the students to learn the material.

Overall, student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects. While working on a project that they designed, students would have much more motivation as they would appreciate the project more. Students would also be more interested in their project because they wouldn't want to make a boring project for themselves. Furthermore, students would have a better learning experience as they would work harder on the project. Ultimately, student-designed projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed projects and, if a school were ever to assign a teacher-designed summer project, the students should present the alternative of a student-designed project to the school.",0
